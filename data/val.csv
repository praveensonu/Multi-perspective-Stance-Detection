51,Minimum Wage,Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?,2s51q4r,https://www.nhpr.org/post/nh-lawmakers-begin-debate-minimum-wage-increase,N.H. Lawmakers Begin Debate on Minimum Wage Increase | New Hampshire Public Radio,"Democrats began their push this session to raise New Hampshire’s minimum wage during hearings at the Statehouse on Tuesday.Lawmakers are considering three different bills that would each take a different approach to increasing the state’s rate, which currently stands at $7.25 an hour.“There may be some place in the United States where $7.25 an hour provides any kind of adequate compensation, but New Hampshire ain’t one of those places,” said Rep. Peter Schmidt, a Democrat from Dover, during a hearing before the House Labor, Industrial and Rehabilitative Services Committee.Schmidt is backing a bill that would increase the rate immediately to $10 an hour. A competing bill would gradually raise the state’s rate to $12 an hour, while a third measure would result in a $15 per hour wage by 2024.Supporters of the bills say New Hampshire’s rate, which is the lowest in New England, results in gainfully employed people still relying on government supports such as welfare.“The more people we have at a low minimum wage, the more taxes are going to be required from all of us to support public assistance programs that those people need to live on,” said Rep. Howard Moffett, a Democrat from Canterbury.But opponents of a higher wage, including many Republicans, say that it leads to higher prices, reduced hours for workers, and more jobs lost to automation.“How much is a cheeseburger going to cost if the teenager working there gets $15 an hour?” asked Rep.

John Larson on Thursday brought to Hartford his signature legislation that proposes to expand the popular Social Security program.His measure, which was introduced Wednesday in the House, would increase average benefits by 2 percent, raise the payroll tax to pay for the broader benefits and strengthen protections against inflation. In 2018, about 63 million Americans received about $1 trillion in benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.“Congress literally has not moved on Social Security,” Larson, D-1st District, said at a presentation at the Capitol. “Social Security is the nation’s No. 1 insurance program. It has never missed a payment. Nor will it.”Larson, a Democrat, praised President Donald Trump, saying support from the White House is possible.“I give credit to President Trump. He said something very courageous during the Republican debate when 16 other Republicans challenged him with respect to Social Security being an entitlement,” Larson said. “He said, ‘No, it’s a benefit people have earned and it shouldn’t be privatized.’ ”“We think that’s an entree to the president to join with us,” Larson said.Such an alliance would be “pretty incredible,” he said. However, he cited precedent as a possible guide to the future: In 1983, Democratic House Speaker Thomas “Tip” O’Neill Jr. and Republican President Ronald Reagan struck a compromise on Social Security reform.“Hmmm. Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump,” said Larson, who was greeted by laughter. “I think we’ll have an opportunity.”Larson was joined by U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, who said many Americans would live in poverty without Social Security.“I know I seem like an unlikely partner for a plan on Social Security,” said Hayes, who is 45. “I should be so fortunate to one day use this and to know that it will be there.”Connecticut residents are particularly dependent on Social Security, with nearly 17 percent of the population 65 or older, according to 2018 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau. That’s just slightly less than the 20 percent of Florida’s population 65 or older.Among its provisions, Larson’s legislation would protect against inflation by using an annual cost of living adjustment formula weighted toward the spending patterns of consumers 62 and older. And it would set a minimum benefit at 25 percent above the poverty line and reduce taxes for more than 12 million Social Security recipients by eliminating the tax on their benefits.The bill proposes to finance the expansion by raising more tax revenue. Payroll taxes are not collected on wages of more than $132,900 and Larson’s legislation would apply the payroll tax to incomes greater than $400,000.The measure also would phase in an increase in the contribution rate beginning in 2020. By 2043, workers and employers would pay 7.4 percent. The current rate is 6.2 percent.Larson has pushed for years to expand the old-age benefit program. But the East Hartford Democrat now has added clout as chairman of the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee. In a nod to its history, Larson introduced the legislation on the 137th anniversary of the birth of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who signed the Social Security into law in 1935.Even if it passes the House, where more than 200 co-sponsors have signed on, the bill faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Since early January, when Democrats took the House from Republicans, several bills have been introduced laying down markers that Democrats will use in House, Senate and presidential elections in 2020.As millions of baby boomers retire or prepare for their post-employment years, Social Security’s total cost was projected to exceed its total income in 2018 for the first time since 1982 and remain higher for years to come, according to a report by the Social Security Trust Fund.The old-age trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2034, according to the report.Stephen Singer can be reached at ssinger@courant.com.

7,Vegetarianism,Should People Become Vegetarian?,1s7q6r,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-thanks-to-vegans-my-vegetarianism-has-become-a-source-of-shame/,"Thanks to vegans, my vegetarianism has become a source of shame - The Globe and Mail","The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.To view your reading history, you must be logged in.The last 10 stories you viewed are saved here. You must be logged in to use this feature.Illustration by Graham RoumieuCarly Lewis is a Toronto-based writer.When I was a child, I’d watch my mother and grandmother plunge their knuckles into wide stainless-steel bowls full of raw, pink meat guck. Expertly, the bowl would be rotated with one hand, the other kneading the defenceless mound into what would eventually become meatballs. I hated it. Existential panic hit me early in life, and my baby mind – having not yet begun to understand the negotiation and mechanics of survival – couldn’t overcome the opaque idea that eating meat was homicidal. It wasn’t that I found animals too cute to eat; it was that I felt horrified by the idea of consuming the life of another being, as though its energy would turn to scorned ghosts inside my stomach. Throughout my adolescence, I ate as little meat as I could, the interior dialogue of my politics resembling that of Lisa Simpson and the baby lamb begging for mercy in her daydream. Shortly after starting university, I decided to go vegetarian.At the time, I hadn’t come up with much of an ethos. Being a vegetarian just meant I didn’t eat meat. I cut out fish, too, had an on-again, off-again relationship with eggs and bought some B12s from the drug store. My diet was, for lack of a better word, lifeless. In 2007, vegetarians were still something of an oddity in my jock-driven university town. Because I didn’t want to explain my childhood fear of being haunted by the vindictive spectres of dead cows, I began to rely on unthoughtful justifications such as “meat is murder” when people asked – albeit often combatively – why I was a vegetarian.Although I now eat fish at my doctor’s encouragement and have since arrived at a more balanced understanding of why some people eat meat and others do not, I have chosen to stick with it. After 12 years, being a vegetarian still feels important to me. For a long time, I was proud of it.Recently, though, my vegetarianism has become a source of shame, so much that I feel an accelerating desire to eat meat again. There has been no conversion of my morality, no educational or economical epiphany. It’s because of the vegans.I know that sensible vegans are out there, nice people who don’t impose their choices on anyone whose lifestyle doesn't, or can’t, resemble theirs. But the sanctimonious melodrama of veganism has become synonymous with any meatless diet.Not long ago, a friend and I were walking elsewhere after dinner when we ran into a feverish throng of protesters huddled around Antler, a 40-seat restaurant on Dundas West in Toronto. Antler has become a premiere destination for vegan protesters, who originally disliked its “Venison is the new kale” sidewalk sign. Antagonized by owner Michael Hunter’s decision to butcher and eat a leg of deer in the window as protesters watched in horror, the vegans continue to return. And that’s fine, insofar as it’s a mutual exchange of differing ideologies, both sides trading in publicity. But Antler is not the target of protests because of any real strategy or political goal. The unrest is the result of a small-scale feud. In both origin and impact, it’s really quite petty.Even less principled is the arrogant spectacle of confused moral virtue-signalling we’ve allowed to gorge on street-facing real estate in Parkdale, a neighbourhood on the western edge of Toronto that has long been a home for immigrants and working-class people. “A mecca for the ethically minded” according to its website, “Vegandale” – the conceptual marketing title intended to encompass the company’s multiple vegan restaurants in close proximity to one another – is founded on bombastically hollow preaching. Its crude, forceful gentrifying mission aside ($8 fried avocado, megalomaniacal signage), it is the nail in the coffin of my willingness to be associated with such garish assertions. (I’d sooner eat at Antler.)Vegandale’s restaurant taglines are zippy “Live, Love, Laugh”-esque shibboleths such as “Morality on Tap” and “The Noble Way of Eating.” The content of their menus is even worse: A See the Light lager is contextualized by the following: “Is it morally okay to be willfully blind to billions of animals being exploited? No. Can going vegan reduce and eliminate the unnecessary suffering and deaths of animals? Yes.” The summary of another beer, the Sour Truth, asks: “Can you love animals without being vegan? No. Is veganism the best thing we can do to align our actions with our morals? Yes.”Its website boasts “Zero Meat, Dairy, Bullshit.” And yet, within 10 minutes of biting into a vegan taco at the Vegandale Brewery last December, Ryerson student Vittoria Rabito, who has a dairy allergy, was rushed to the hospital. The rest of the menu, too, provides little convincing toward any kind of noble culinary commitment. It’s fast food for people who think they’re too good for McDonald’s. Vegandale’s unnuanced and performative ideology feels less about sparing the lives of animals through ethical consumption, and more about superficially policing the idea of what people should eat. And that’s what I detest about all of this. Being vegan or vegetarian could be a level-headed personal choice but has morphed into a sect that feels borderline Scientological.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementWhen Beyoncé’s personal trainer, Marco Borges, published his new book, The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World, late last year, the singer and her husband, Jay-Z, appeared as authors of the introduction. Their language, meant to mobilize, was telling. “Once we looked at health as the truth, instead of a diet, it became a mission for us to share that truth and lifestyle with as many people as possible … Let’s take this stand together. Let’s spread the truth. Let’s make this mission a movement.” (Last month, Beyoncé announced on Instagram that one fan would win free concert tickets for life if they signed up for The Greenprint Project, a plant-based eating campaign launched in conjunction with Mr. Borges’ book.)It’s a much gentler approach than PETA’s “Feeding Kids Meat is Child Abuse” billboards, which began appearing throughout England in 2006, and which the controversial animal-rights organization petitioned, unsuccessfully, to translate to Spanish and display in Puerto Rico in 2015. Still, the inherent suggestion that vegetarianism would produce demonstrable moral or political superiority is ultimately moored to class discrimination. The average vegetarian dinner is more elaborate, time-consuming and arguably more expensive to cook than the average meat-based meal. (Toronto’s beloved Kensington Market café Hibiscus has a salad with 42 ingredients.) It is simply not reasonable to ask a person who is low on the luxury of time and who lacks the means to forage local fine-food purveyors to get really into tempeh. (Many high-profile vegan advocates have used the cause to become celebrities, or were celebrities to begin with, which means cooking is part of their workday already or that they have a staff to handle meal preparation.)In a piece for Maclean’s last December, journalist and animal-rights advocate Jessica Scott-Reid wrote, “While veganism may not be a catch-all solution to the planet’s many problems, the ethical arguments in favour of a vegan diet are increasingly too strong to ignore without loud cognitive dissonance.” Ms. Scott-Reid’s article, titled “Why everybody should rid themselves of old habits – and go vegan,” helpfully cites plenty of research to explain her position. Animal agriculture, she writes, produces more greenhouse gas emissions than every form of transportation combined, in addition to its damaging contributions to deforestation, pollution and loss of wildlife and biodiversity. On top of that, she says, it takes seven kilograms of grain and more than 15,000 litres of water to produce a single kilogram of beef.“Eating animals and the food they produce is no longer necessary; the majority of the Western world has other options,” Ms. Scott-Reid wrote. “And while plant-based proteins, fats and other nutrients are inaccessible for some communities, work is under way to lower costs and increase availability.”Here is where the discord rises. There is a prevailing myth in vegan circles that anyone who continues to remain non-vegan is doing so because they don’t know better – or because they think they can’t afford to change their diet, but really they could, with the help of some oracular vegan missionary. But ultimately, people like eating meat, because it’s fortifying and tastes delicious, and because it is often the primary focus of the plate. Just as any deep-rooted standard takes time and intention to reconsider, a lifelong meat-eater, especially one based rurally, is probably not going to switch to veganism because they saw a protest outside a restaurant in Toronto on the news. Moreover, the lowered costs and increased availability of reasonable access to plant-based proteins that Ms. Scott-Reid forecasts have nowhere near reached communities living with food insecurity. Isn’t it misguided to care about what people eat, but not whether they can afford food? I don’t doubt that there are lower-income vegetarians who make it work. But it’s hard.A few nights ago, deep in deadline mode, I ordered dinner from a popular vegetarian restaurant in Toronto. The meal itself was exactly what I’d summoned – various soy hunks drizzled in self-aggrandizing meat-free mucilage and a salad with the word “detox” in its title. I made it halfway through and felt physically awful, even worse when I got up from the table and surveyed the carnage of takeout containers strewn around my workspace. This is the admirable way to eat? Preachers of vegetarianism promise that eliminating meat will make a person feel healthier, stronger, happier and more energetic. Without extending the gesture of ethical food decisions beyond the personal act of eating, however, vegetarianism doesn’t negate one’s capacity for feeling gross.I’m not advocating for reckless or ignorant consumption. Aside from behemoth food-production corporations, I don’t know anyone who is. At the time of this writing, I remain a vegetarian. But much like being trapped in bad conversation at a party, I am losing morale and looking for an exit.In 2018, animal-rights activist Joey “Carbstrong,” who has a “Vegan” tattoo behind his ear, became angry on-air when he noticed a ham sandwich in the studio of BBC radio host Jeremy Vine. ""Ham is a euphemism that actually comes from the flesh of a dead pig,” Mr. Carbstrong (whose real last name is Armstrong) said in the segment. “I’d like you to call it the dead body of an animal that didn’t want to die.” In a 2014 Q&A, singer Morrissey, an ardent animal-rights activist who once walked off stage at the Coachella music festival because he could smell a nearby barbecue, compared eating meat to pedophilia, going so far as to say, “If you believe in the abattoir, then you would support Auschwitz.” (There was a time in my life I’d have found Morrissey’s “I can smell burning flesh … and I hope to God it’s human” quip amusing. That time was 2009. I had a Velvet Underground poster in my bedroom and ate exclusively at Pita Pit.) Morrissey has also been a vocal critic of the Canadian seal hunt, despite it being a crucial food and income source to rural communities living with food insecurity. (Nancy Mike, an Iqaluit-based throat singer who performs with the Jerry Cans, told me that one adult seal will provide sustenance to six families, with six or seven people in each family.)In 2016, outrage erupted when it was discovered that the owners of Café Gratitude, a plant-based restaurant chain in the Los Angeles area, were openly transitioning to a diet that included meat they raised themselves on a personal farm. A boycott campaign that included a spate of one-star Yelp reviews ensued. Said one of those Yelp reviews: “F***ing HYPOCRITES!!!! Hope they will be FLAME BURNED and eaten by Meat Eaters!”Just this week, when a natural-foods grocery store in Toronto offered heart-shaped steaks for Valentine’s Day, prominent animal-rights activist Len Goldberg posted an image of them to Facebook and directed his followers to respond to the company. Said one, on the store’s Facebook page: “Ironically, it’s also what stops and kills OUR human HEART.” Another called the steaks “an insult to life itself.”Just as there are valid reasons to eat meat, there are, of course, valid reasons to minimize or do without it. A study published by health and science journal Nature in October stated an urgent need for people to embrace, at the very least, a “flexitarian” diet in order to keep climate change under two degrees. This potentially impactful shift would mean reducing individual carbon footprints through eating mostly plant-based foods, without eliminating meat completely. According to the study, if the average carnivore ate 75-per-cent less beef, 90-per-cent less pork and cut their egg intake by 50 per cent while tripling their consumption of beans and quadrupling their consumption of nuts and seeds, emissions from livestock would be reduced by half. (The production of animal products generates the majority of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, at about 78 per cent.) According to environmental research website Shrink That Footprint, the carbon footprint of a vegetarian is half that of a “meat lover”; the vegan carbon footprint even less. That there are compelling environmental arguments for reducing meat consumption is indisputable. We should be attentive to what we consume, and make decisions with our environmental burden in mind. But doing so is made much less desirable by the abrasive shaming tactics employed by the vegan lobby, whose cacophony drowns out any hope of reasonable discourse.In A Matter of Taste, author Rebecca Tucker writes that “For many, the zealotry with which food is approached – and discussed, evangelized about, and proselytized on – mirrors religious fanaticism … And just like religious devotion, which is meant to encourage thinking outside of oneself but is too often reduced by the devout to empty piousness and self-righteousness, so too are most food philosophies inward-facing and outward guilting.”The ever-fortifying campaign to proliferate has made veganism into a guild of judgmental extremists, always looking for their next recruit. Just as I, as a child, could not overcome the opaque idea that eating meat was homicidal, the overall culture of veganism seems unable to defeat its own superiority complex. That oft-detected combativeness from frat guys trying to get a rise out of me at university parties by asking if I wanted a steak has created a generation of defensive anti-meat votaries who want to have their dairy-free, egg-free almond milk cake and fight about it, too. I'm exasperated. And, by association, I'm embarrassed.So I am preparing to say goodbye to 12 years of vegetarianism. I’d rather be a gracious member of society who respects the choices of others than unwittingly bolster a clique gone off the rails. I won’t be a daily meat-eater. But to continue abstaining from it, as the cult of meatlessness spirals further into hysterics, feels like a defection from decency.If I hear the ghosts of my morality howling, I’ll send them to Vegandale.Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

Thanks to vegans, my vegetarianism has become a source of shame - The Globe and Mail The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures.To view your reading history, you must be logged in.The last 10 stories you viewed are saved here.

Expertly, the bowl would be rotated with one hand, the other kneading the defenceless mound into what would eventually become meatballs. I hated it. Existential panic hit me early in life, and my baby mind – having not yet begun to understand the negotiation and mechanics of survival – couldn’t overcome the opaque idea that eating meat was homicidal. It wasn’t that I found animals too cute to eat; it was that I felt horrified by the idea of consuming the life of another being, as though its energy would turn to scorned ghosts inside my stomach. Throughout my adolescence, I ate as little meat as I could, the interior dialogue of my politics resembling that of Lisa Simpson and the baby lamb begging for mercy in her daydream. Shortly after starting university, I decided to go vegetarian.At the time, I hadn’t come up with much of an ethos. Being a vegetarian just meant I didn’t eat meat. I cut out fish, too, had an on-again, off-again relationship with eggs and bought some B12s from the drug store. My diet was, for lack of a better word, lifeless. In 2007, vegetarians were still something of an oddity in my jock-driven university town. Because I didn’t want to explain my childhood fear of being haunted by the vindictive spectres of dead cows, I began to rely on unthoughtful justifications such as “meat is murder” when people asked – albeit often combatively – why I was a vegetarian.Although I now eat fish at my doctor’s encouragement and have since arrived at a more balanced understanding of why some people eat meat and others do not, I have chosen to stick with it. After 12 years, being a vegetarian still feels important to me. For a long time, I was proud of it.Recently, though, my vegetarianism has become a source of shame, so much that I feel an accelerating desire to eat meat again. There has been no conversion of my morality, no educational or economical epiphany. It’s because of the vegans.I know that sensible vegans are out there, nice people who don’t impose their choices on anyone whose lifestyle doesn't, or can’t, resemble theirs. But the sanctimonious melodrama of veganism has become synonymous with any meatless diet.Not long ago, a friend and I were walking elsewhere after dinner when we ran into a feverish throng of protesters huddled around Antler, a 40-seat restaurant on Dundas West in Toronto. Antler has become a premiere destination for vegan protesters, who originally disliked its “Venison is the new kale” sidewalk sign. Antagonized by owner Michael Hunter’s decision to butcher and eat a leg of deer in the window as protesters watched in horror, the vegans continue to return. And that’s fine, insofar as it’s a mutual exchange of differing ideologies, both sides trading in publicity. But Antler is not the target of protests because of any real strategy or political goal. The unrest is the result of a small-scale feud. In both origin and impact, it’s really quite petty.Even less principled is the arrogant spectacle of confused moral virtue-signalling we’ve allowed to gorge on street-facing real estate in Parkdale, a neighbourhood on the western edge of Toronto that has long been a home for immigrants and working-class people. “A mecca for the ethically minded” according to its website, “Vegandale” – the conceptual marketing title intended to encompass the company’s multiple vegan restaurants in close proximity to one another – is founded on bombastically hollow preaching. Its crude, forceful gentrifying mission aside ($8 fried avocado, megalomaniacal signage), it is the nail in the coffin of my willingness to be associated with such garish assertions. (I’d sooner eat at Antler.)Vegandale’s restaurant taglines are zippy “Live, Love, Laugh”-esque shibboleths such as “Morality on Tap” and “The Noble Way of Eating.” The content of their menus is even worse: A See the Light lager is contextualized by the following: “Is it morally okay to be willfully blind to billions of animals being exploited? No. Can going vegan reduce and eliminate the unnecessary suffering and deaths of animals? Yes.” The summary of another beer, the Sour Truth, asks: “Can you love animals without being vegan? No. Is veganism the best thing we can do to align our actions with our morals? Yes.”Its website boasts “Zero Meat, Dairy, Bullshit.” And yet, within 10 minutes of biting into a vegan taco at the Vegandale Brewery last December, Ryerson student Vittoria Rabito, who has a dairy allergy, was rushed to the hospital. The rest of the menu, too, provides little convincing toward any kind of noble culinary commitment. It’s fast food for people who think they’re too good for McDonald’s. Vegandale’s unnuanced and performative ideology feels less about sparing the lives of animals through ethical consumption, and more about superficially policing the idea of what people should eat. And that’s what I detest about all of this. Being vegan or vegetarian could be a level-headed personal choice but has morphed into a sect that feels borderline Scientological.Story continues below advertisementStory continues below advertisementWhen Beyoncé’s personal trainer, Marco Borges, published his new book, The Greenprint: Plant-Based Diet, Best Body, Better World, late last year, the singer and her husband, Jay-Z, appeared as authors of the introduction. Their language, meant to mobilize, was telling. “Once we looked at health as the truth, instead of a diet, it became a mission for us to share that truth and lifestyle with as many people as possible … Let’s take this stand together. Let’s spread the truth. Let’s make this mission a movement.” (Last month, Beyoncé announced on Instagram that one fan would win free concert tickets for life if they signed up for The Greenprint Project, a plant-based eating campaign launched in conjunction with Mr. Borges’ book.)It’s a much gentler approach than PETA’s “Feeding Kids Meat is Child Abuse” billboards, which began appearing throughout England in 2006, and which the controversial animal-rights organization petitioned, unsuccessfully, to translate to Spanish and display in Puerto Rico in 2015. Still, the inherent suggestion that vegetarianism would produce demonstrable moral or political superiority is ultimately moored to class discrimination. The average vegetarian dinner is more elaborate, time-consuming and arguably more expensive to cook than the average meat-based meal. (Toronto’s beloved Kensington Market café Hibiscus has a salad with 42 ingredients.) It is simply not reasonable to ask a person who is low on the luxury of time and who lacks the means to forage local fine-food purveyors to get really into tempeh. (Many high-profile vegan advocates have used the cause to become celebrities, or were celebrities to begin with, which means cooking is part of their workday already or that they have a staff to handle meal preparation.)In a piece for Maclean’s last December, journalist and animal-rights advocate Jessica Scott-Reid wrote, “While veganism may not be a catch-all solution to the planet’s many problems, the ethical arguments in favour of a vegan diet are increasingly too strong to ignore without loud cognitive dissonance.” Ms. Scott-Reid’s article, titled “Why everybody should rid themselves of old habits – and go vegan,” helpfully cites plenty of research to explain her position.

So, I just thought that since the state was looking at making all police officers wear body cameras, I figured this might be a good way to have records of what lawmakers are doing.”House Bill 3447 would direct the State Board of Elections to develop rules for the use of body cameras by public officials of the state.Recordings made with the use of a body camera worn by a public official could be used as evidence in any administrative, judicial, legislative or disciplinary proceeding.

We would find ways of being able to remove them.”Cabello, who is a veteran Rockford police officer, said his body camera proposal is not an attempt to reinvent the wheel.“It’s going to be the same as what law enforcement will have to do,” he said. “There’s not going to be one person going through all of the recordings. It’s more of if someone makes an allegation or a complaint, you’ll at least have some footage to go through.”The proposal is a unique but costly approach to weeding out corruption, said state Rep. Joe Sosnowski, R-Rockford.“If it’s limited to certain groups of officials, that could limit the cost, but it could be extremely expensive,” Sosnowski said. “Then, of course, you have all of the backroom support and infrastructure as far as recording and maintaining the records and the servers and those folks to maintain that. It would probably be a very costly endeavor and I think it would be very difficult to enforce when they actually were using it.”State Sen. Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford, said he’s willing to consider Cabello’s proposal with some reservations.“Before we spend lots of taxpayer dollars on putting cameras on 177 lawmakers and thousands of other public officials around the state, I wonder if Rep.

24,Sanctuary Cities,Should Sanctuary Cities Receive Federal Funding?,2s24q3r,https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/02/19/sanctuary-cites-bill-clears-early-hurdle/,Sanctuary cities bill clears early hurdle | Tampa Bay Times,"TALLAHASSEE -- Sen. Joe Gruters’ anti-sanctuary city bill cleared its first of three hurdles Tuesday. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 4-2 along party lines to approve the bill, which died in the Senate last year. It was tabled last Monday after long testimony, confusion about wording and Gruters’ obligations elsewhere. Gruters, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, filed the same language from the bill he co-sponsored last year but has said his new role as leader of the party will boost support for the bill. Senate Bill 168 creates rules relating to federal immigration enforcement by prohibiting “sanctuary” policies and requiring state and local law enforcement to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The bill also would give whistleblower status for officers who report citizenship violations by undocumented immigrants detained in local jails on unrelated charges. “This bill defines what a sanctuary policy is, and makes sure we hold local governments accountable to make sure they follow the rule of law,” said Gruters, who represents Sarasota. “That is what this country is based on.” Sen. Aaron Bean, R-Fernandina Beach and Republican Reps. Cord Byrd and Erin Grall filed similar bills in the Senate and House. Under this bill, local law enforcement would be required to honor federal law enforcement’s request for “immigration detainer,” meaning a request that another law enforcement agency detain a person based on probable cause to believe that the person is a “removable alien” under federal immigration law. People can be held for up to 48 hours after their set release date under a detainer, allowing time for immigration agents to travel to local jails. The bill prohibits local governments from hindering communication between ICE and local law enforcement. Gruters said 27 of Florida’s 67 counties have an existing agreement with ICE. He said of those counties, 500 people from 35 nations were deported. He also listed counties or cities such as Broward County, Key West and St. Petersburg, which he says are not up to par with honoring ICE detainer requests. Though the bill no longer includes punitive measures for places who maintain “sanctuary” policies, Gruters said those counties or municipalities would “be handled” by Attorney General Ashley Moody. “Cooperation works, and it should be required in Florida to protect law-abiding citizens,” he said. “ ... This is about trying to take the bad people and make sure they can’t go back out into society.” The bill passed without amendments proposed by Sen. José Javier Rodríguez, a Miami Democrat who hoped to block information from schools from being shared with immigration authorities. A push to protect immigrant crime victims or witnesses also failed. This legislation is not a personal priority for Senate President Galvano, but it should be vetted, he said in a statement last week. President Pro Tempore David Simmons has indicated to Galvano that he is interested in working with Gruters on this legislation to address issues that caused concern in the Senate in prior years. Galvano encouraged him to do so, he said. In January 2017, a newly sworn-in President Donald Trump issued an executive order that threatened to cut federal funding from areas he called “sanctuary jurisdictions.” The next day, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez issued a directive for Miami-Dade to resume the county’s practice of accepting detention requests from federal immigration agents for people already booked in local jails on unrelated criminal charges. Miami-Dade Republican Sens. Anitere Flores and René García voted against a similar bill last year. García was term-limited out of the Senate, but Flores is a member of the Senate Rules Committee, which could be the last stop for the bill before a full floor vote. The new bill authorizes a board of county commissioners to pass ordinances to recover costs for complying with an immigration detainer. Opponents say immigration reform should instead be left to Congress and that this legislation may endanger immigrants who commit minor offenses like driving without a license. Members of the Florida Immigrant Coalition and other immigrants’ rights and religious groups packed the room to testify against the bill. Mateo Vuerte, a 16-year-old Venezuelan immigrant from Coral Springs, said after the vote that he worries about what might happen if he is charged with a small offense. “A couple of weeks ago, my friend got pulled over when he was driving to school without a driver’s license,” Vuerte said. “He’s an undocumented immigrant, and now he has a court date. His family and him just came here to seek asylum.” An immigration staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, Amien Kacou, said the premise of the bill has “no basis in reality.” The ACLU is involved in two lawsuits regarding ICE detainer cases in Monroe and Miami-Dade counties. “In terms of the data, the justification, given the high risk of racial profiling, is highly deficient,” Kacou said. “We’ve already discussed the issue of competence and what Floridians would be required to produce to show their citizenship. Are we going to require that people arrested are to have a birth certificate or passport on their person?” Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump supporter from the start of his campaign, made clear his stance on sanctuary cities in his inaugural address, which drew loud cheers and claps. “We will stand for the rule of law,” he said. “We will not allow sanctuary cities.

21,Drinking Age - Lower It,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?,1s21q10r,http://www.teenink.com/opinion/drugs_alcohol_smoking/article/806875/Should-the-Drinking-Age-Be-Lowered/,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered? | Teen Ink,"Please enter the email address that you use to login to TeenInk.com, and we'll email you instructions to reset your password. The minimum legal drinking age should not be lowered to 18. Even at 21 the brain isn’t fully developed, so lowering the drinking age to 18 would be dangerous and medically irresponsible. There would be an increase in binge drinking due to a lack of impulse control in those whose brains aren’t fully developed. There would also be more unsafe and illegal drinking activity, as well as more fatal accidents and dangerous behavior caused by being intoxicated.  Lowering the minimum legal drinking age would be medically irresponsible. The brain is not fully developed until the age of 25, and even then some people’s brains develop slower and aren’t fully developed until the early 30’s. Alcohol has an extremely dangerous effect on the brain that can be even more dangerous if the brain is not fully developed. Researchers at Duke University Medical Center and Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center studied the effects of alcohol on young adults ranging from 21 to 30 years old. They found that alcohol impaired learning and memory in the younger adults more than the older ones. Alcohol affects the parts of the brain that control thought processing, consciousness, movement, balance, hormones, and automatic brain functions such as breathing. This is why it is unsafe to drive after drinking. Alcohol affects how quickly a person can react and how well a person can function. A study in 2002 showed that MLDA 21 produced fewer traffic accidents. 98% of the analyses show that a higher drinking age results in less fatal accidents caused to drunk driving. With MLDA 18, people would be able to legally drink at an age where impulse control isn’t at its best. This means that that younger people drinking are more likely to drink more than they should and build up their tolerance to alcohol. The more they drink, the more tolerant they will become. Then they will need to continue to consume more and more amounts of alcohol to produce the same feeling of intoxication. Tolerance leads to heavy drinking which can eventually lead to alcohol-dependence or alcoholism. MLDA 18 would evidently increase the amount of binge drinking and alcohol abuse. Also, if 18-yer-olds are allowed to buy alcohol, then it would be easier for teenagers to get their hands on alcohol because they could just have their friends or family members of legal age buy it for them. This would increase illegal and unsafe drinking activity. “Consuming alcohol has proved to make males more virile and females more sexually attractive.” This affect can lead to risky or criminal sexual activity such as unprotected sex or rape. Teens who average five or more drinks daily are three times less likely to use a condom, and 16% of teens who drink use a condom less often after having consumed alcohol. Alcohol use is implicated in two-thirds of sexual assault and date rape cases among teens and college students. Some may argue that lowering the drinking age and allowing 18 to 20-year olds to buy alcohol would benefit the economy by increasing revenue of private business and increasing the amount of tax revenue collected by the government. However, MLDA 18 would create an easier way for underage drinkers to get alcohol. Every year, middle school and high school students drink 1.1 million cans of beer and 35% of all wine coolers sold in America. Two-thirds of those teens say they are able to buy their own alcohol. If that many teens are able to get alcohol with MLDA 21, then just imagine how many more teens would be able to get alcohol with MLDA 18. It would also allow 18 to 20-year-olds to go to bars and nightclubs which are unsafe environments. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, approximately 15,000 Americans are treated each year for intentional poisoning. The typical victims are at nightclubs and bars where they are drugged then raped, assaulted, or robbed. In 60% of those cases, the people involved had been consuming alcohol. Studies have also shown that 58-85% of bar sales were illegal “sales to obviously intoxicated patrons”. This proves that bars and nightclubs aren’t the “safe, regulated environments” most people assume they are. There are a lot of risks that come with drinking in these environments that should not be available for 18 to 20-year-olds. Others may say that since 18 is the age of adulthood, 18-year-olds should be given the right to choose to drink just like they can choose to vote or join the army. Although this is true that 18 is the age adulthood, it is not a constitutional right to drink at 18, so; therefore, they do not have a choice in that matter. Also, the age should be kept at 21 due to the dangers of drinking. The NIAAA has made it a priority for future research to focus on studying alcoholism and trying to find a cure for it. Until then, it would be in the best interest of America to keep MLDA 21 to keep the risk of young adults becoming alcoholics to a minimum and reduce the dangers of underage drinking. I personally do not have a want or need to consume alcohol until of legal age, and hopefully I can influence other teenagers to do the same. Those under 21 need to understand and be aware of the dangers and long-term effects of drinking, especially before the brain is fully developed. I feel there should be more awareness raised in school. Schools have health classes and awareness weeks, but the dangers and risks of consuming alcohol should be enforced more than just one week of the year or one unit of a class. The younger the age alcohol is consumed, the higher the risk and dangers of consuming it. MLDA 21 will help to keep America safer. MLDA 18 has too many risks and should not be considered a responsible drinking age. My Honors English class had an assignment to research and write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic. I chose to do mine on the drinking age because I feel it is important for teens to see that it is unsafe to drink before they are 21.Favorite Quote:""It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams."" - Pres.

Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people.When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6.No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals.By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision.Related: Experts say legal ages to drive, and to drink, should be switched“In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.”Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states — and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 — that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age — or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries — Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others — with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.“I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.“The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.”MADD about underage drinkingTwo generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 — or owning an ID that says you are — to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer?By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol — effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 — a bigger decline than for older age groups.“Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year, while MADD calls the legislation “one of the nation’s most important and lifesaving laws.”A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury.The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age.A stalled movementThere’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president.Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.”“Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week.“It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.”Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere.“We missed our moment,” he said.Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far.Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18.“There isn’t much appetite to change something that appears to be working,” said Martinic of ICAP. “It’s not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It’s pretty much a no go.”But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government.And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit — not unlike a driver’s license — upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.Do you think the drinking age in the U.S. should be lowered?

The minimum legal drinking age should not be lowered to 18. Even at 21 the brain isn’t fully developed, so lowering the drinking age to 18 would be dangerous and medically irresponsible. There would be an increase in binge drinking due to a lack of impulse control in those whose brains aren’t fully developed. There would also be more unsafe and illegal drinking activity, as well as more fatal accidents and dangerous behavior caused by being intoxicated.  Lowering the minimum legal drinking age would be medically irresponsible. The brain is not fully developed until the age of 25, and even then some people’s brains develop slower and aren’t fully developed until the early 30’s. Alcohol has an extremely dangerous effect on the brain that can be even more dangerous if the brain is not fully developed. Researchers at Duke University Medical Center and Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center studied the effects of alcohol on young adults ranging from 21 to 30 years old. They found that alcohol impaired learning and memory in the younger adults more than the older ones. Alcohol affects the parts of the brain that control thought processing, consciousness, movement, balance, hormones, and automatic brain functions such as breathing. This is why it is unsafe to drive after drinking. Alcohol affects how quickly a person can react and how well a person can function. A study in 2002 showed that MLDA 21 produced fewer traffic accidents. 98% of the analyses show that a higher drinking age results in less fatal accidents caused to drunk driving. With MLDA 18, people would be able to legally drink at an age where impulse control isn’t at its best. This means that that younger people drinking are more likely to drink more than they should and build up their tolerance to alcohol. The more they drink, the more tolerant they will become. Then they will need to continue to consume more and more amounts of alcohol to produce the same feeling of intoxication. Tolerance leads to heavy drinking which can eventually lead to alcohol-dependence or alcoholism. MLDA 18 would evidently increase the amount of binge drinking and alcohol abuse. Also, if 18-yer-olds are allowed to buy alcohol, then it would be easier for teenagers to get their hands on alcohol because they could just have their friends or family members of legal age buy it for them. This would increase illegal and unsafe drinking activity. “Consuming alcohol has proved to make males more virile and females more sexually attractive.” This affect can lead to risky or criminal sexual activity such as unprotected sex or rape. Teens who average five or more drinks daily are three times less likely to use a condom, and 16% of teens who drink use a condom less often after having consumed alcohol. Alcohol use is implicated in two-thirds of sexual assault and date rape cases among teens and college students. Some may argue that lowering the drinking age and allowing 18 to 20-year olds to buy alcohol would benefit the economy by increasing revenue of private business and increasing the amount of tax revenue collected by the government. However, MLDA 18 would create an easier way for underage drinkers to get alcohol. Every year, middle school and high school students drink 1.1 million cans of beer and 35% of all wine coolers sold in America. Two-thirds of those teens say they are able to buy their own alcohol. If that many teens are able to get alcohol with MLDA 21, then just imagine how many more teens would be able to get alcohol with MLDA 18. It would also allow 18 to 20-year-olds to go to bars and nightclubs which are unsafe environments. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, approximately 15,000 Americans are treated each year for intentional poisoning. The typical victims are at nightclubs and bars where they are drugged then raped, assaulted, or robbed. In 60% of those cases, the people involved had been consuming alcohol. Studies have also shown that 58-85% of bar sales were illegal “sales to obviously intoxicated patrons”. This proves that bars and nightclubs aren’t the “safe, regulated environments” most people assume they are. There are a lot of risks that come with drinking in these environments that should not be available for 18 to 20-year-olds. Others may say that since 18 is the age of adulthood, 18-year-olds should be given the right to choose to drink just like they can choose to vote or join the army. Although this is true that 18 is the age adulthood, it is not a constitutional right to drink at 18, so; therefore, they do not have a choice in that matter. Also, the age should be kept at 21 due to the dangers of drinking. The NIAAA has made it a priority for future research to focus on studying alcoholism and trying to find a cure for it. Until then, it would be in the best interest of America to keep MLDA 21 to keep the risk of young adults becoming alcoholics to a minimum and reduce the dangers of underage drinking. I personally do not have a want or need to consume alcohol until of legal age, and hopefully I can influence other teenagers to do the same. Those under 21 need to understand and be aware of the dangers and long-term effects of drinking, especially before the brain is fully developed. I feel there should be more awareness raised in school. Schools have health classes and awareness weeks, but the dangers and risks of consuming alcohol should be enforced more than just one week of the year or one unit of a class. The younger the age alcohol is consumed, the higher the risk and dangers of consuming it. MLDA 21 will help to keep America safer. MLDA 18 has too many risks and should not be considered a responsible drinking age. My Honors English class had an assignment to research and write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic. I chose to do mine on the drinking age because I feel it is important for teens to see that it is unsafe to drink before they are 21.Favorite Quote:hiFavorite Quote:if hate is such a powerful word then why do we say love like its nuthing?...Favorite Quote:What glitters aint goldThis article has 0 comments.Copyright © 2019 Teen InkWhich of your works would you like to tell your friends about?

Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people.When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6.No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals.By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision.Related: Experts say legal ages to drive, and to drink, should be switched“In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.”Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states — and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 — that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age — or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries — Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others — with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.“I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.“The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.”MADD about underage drinkingTwo generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 — or owning an ID that says you are — to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer?By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol — effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 — a bigger decline than for older age groups.“Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year, while MADD calls the legislation “one of the nation’s most important and lifesaving laws.”A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury.The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age.A stalled movementThere’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president.Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.”“Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week.“It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.”Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere.“We missed our moment,” he said.Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far.Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election.

According to the university, allotted tickets were in such high demand, they were gone in less than two minutes last week.Without even knowing what the 42nd President of the United States would address during his speech, ticket holders waited anxiously in the rain to be allowed the chance to wait again for doors to open at Riceland Hall.The audience clapped with enthusiasm when the former President made his way to the podium, shaking hands with Chancellor Kelly Damphousse on the way.“I feel like time has passed me by,” Clinton said as he recounted stories of being on the A-State campus.“I have had a long and interesting history with ASU,” Clinton said. He remembered the Commencement Address he gave as Attorney General in 1977.“Rain caused it to be moved to the field house,” the former President recalled. “Where it was set and hot and without any air-conditioning.”That he said led to the Convocation Center being built.“First National Bank Arena began by people sweating in the old field house,” Clinton said.Clinton’s appearance at Arkansas State University was made possible by a Riceland Foods endowment, as part of the Riceland Distinguished Presentation Series. Harry Thomason, TV and film producer, convinced him that it would be a good idea.“He loves Arkansas State and he was actually supposed to go somewhere else tonight overseas,” Thomason said.The trip home to Arkansas won out for former President Clinton.However, the evening wasn’t just spent on reminiscing.“I think we are living in a time of stunning opportunities and deeply troubling challenges,” Clinton said.The former President challenged the next generation to think of new ways to problem solve and “unstick” themselves from issues that bring them down such as poverty.“I grew up in a very different time,” Clinton told the audience.He spoke of the value of getting to know someone’s personal story.“The people whom you disagree with are ‘people’ and because they are important to the outcome you’re going to play by certain rules, and there are some things you just won’t do,” he explained.Instead of attacking people for their political positions, Clinton challenged the audience to embrace diversity.“Diverse groups make better decisions,” he said. “Cooperation is a better strategy for living and working together than constant conflict.”The former President never named the current administration in his presentation. He told students in the audience that education is the key to unlocking problems now and in the future.Those unable to attend President Clinton’s speech can watch it here.Copyright 2019 KAIT.

19,Corporal Punishment,Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?,2s19q1r,https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/leadership-higher-education/what-progressive-education,What is Progressive Education? | Leadership in Higher Education,"A former college president and state attorney general considers leadership issues in higher education.Thoreau as a teacher.I have spent much of my career in higher education, as a law professor and college president, but I am also a trustee of a small independent K-12 school in my hometown of Portland. Our school prides itself on providing “progressive” education, but we struggle at times to define what that means. Dewey, of course, defined progressive education, at least in part, as “learning from experience.” But what does that look like in practice? This past week, I have been reading Laura Dassow Walls’ excellent new biography of Henry Thoreau. Walls provides, among other things, an extensive discussion of Thoreau’s teaching career. She covers, of course, Thoreau’s brief and notorious experience as a public school teacher. Chastised by the local school committee because he refused to use corporal punishment to discipline his students, Thoreau famously beat a number of students and then resigned. Walls also describes Thoreau’s much less well known, but vastly more significant, time running his own private academy with his brother John. Thoreau, Walls reminds us, was a gifted scholar, at home in six languages, and his private academy required rigorous college preparatory work in Greek, Latin, and math. But Thoreau thought an indoor, book-focused education was too limited, and he supplemented traditional methods with many trips outside the schoolhouse.  He took his students to a newspaper to see the type set and the printing presses at work, and to a gunsmith’s, where the students made their own percussion flints.  He took students on long hikes for field lessons in geography and botany and boating on the Concord River, with instruction on wooden boat maintenance thrown in.  He took his students surveying and on field archeology trips to former Native American sites.  He sought, in short, to pass on constructive and practical wisdom, out in the fields and in local workplaces, and not just book learning at school. Thoreau’s methods were very similar to those used by the great philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein during his stint as a rural schoolmaster. Wittgenstein’s pedagogical methods were the antithesis of Thoreau’s in some ways.  Unlike Thoreau, who was criticized for refusing to use corporal punishment, Wittgenstein was notorious for using it too much.  Still, there are important similarities.  As Spencer Robbins noted in an interesting Paris Review article back in 2015, Wittgenstein and his students designed and built small model steam engines, dissected animals, took field trips from their rural community to Vienna, and studied the constellations outdoors at night, gazing at the stars.Today, Thoreau and Wittgenstein are widely viewed, outside the academy, as impractical and ethereal idealists, theoreticians, misfits in the “real world,” but in truth, both were men of deep practical talents. Wittgenstein was an engineer, Thoreau a gifted surveyor and pencil manufacturer who designed his family firm’s pathbreaking manufacturing equipment.  Though both thinkers were reserved, bookish, and introverted, they believed profoundly that K-12 education must be broader, more practical, and more experimental than was typical in their day or ours. Do we need more progressive education today? I will leave that for experts. I will say, however, that if I were in school, I would want what Thoreau was offering, and as an adult, I would want it for my child as well.  In recent years, educators have noted massive increases in depression and anxiety among college students. At a recent meeting with independent school heads, one of them said to me: “I worry we are doing something wrong, if we are handing our students off to you in that shape.” Maybe part of the solution to this problem lies in more holistic experiential learning and less focus on SAT scores and AP exams.  And maybe some of that experiential learning would serve us well at the college level, too.             jump to commentsBe the first to know.Get our free daily newsletter.

29,Climate Change,Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?,2s29q8r,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/climate-change-is-a-public-health-emergency/,Climate Change Is a Public Health Emergency - Scientific American Blog Network,"We use cookies to personalize content and ads, to provide social media features and to analyze our traffic.

Privacy PolicyActiveAlways ActiveWhat Happened to All of the Universe's Antimatter?Anthropocene Now: Influential Panel Votes to Recognize Earth's New EpochCreative Types Reserve a Special Corner of the Brain for Dreaming BigHere are eight reasons whyEver since human-caused climate change emerged into public consciousness around the late 1980s, news stories and public awareness campaigns surrounding the topic have predominantly been accompanied by images of polar bears and melting ice, reinforcing common misconceptions that the impacts are far away in space and time and removed from our daily lives. Recent national surveys showed that 58 percent of Americans believe that they themselves will not be harmed by climate change, while 61 percent had given little or no thought to how climate change might affect people’s health.Yet mounting scientific evidence has led experts to conclude that climate change presents “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century”. A recent study demonstrated that there are 467 different pathways by which human health, water, food, economy, infrastructure and security have already been impacted by climate hazards. Here are 8 major ways that climate change harms our health today and threatens it tomorrow:1. The frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms are increasing due to climate change.The most well-known and visible manifestation of climate change to date is probably the increasing volatility of extreme weather events worldwide, causing deaths, injuries, debilitating and fatal diseases, and displacement. Researchers have estimated that climate-related disasters caused 2.52 million deaths globally between 1980 and 2013. Besides the growing research field of attribution studies, in which scientists can tease out the role climate change played in increasing the likelihood and/or severity of an extreme event, some have gone even further to make a direct connection to the human death toll. For example, researchers estimated that during the 2003 European heat wave, which claimed over 70,000 lives in 12 countries, climate change increased the likelihood of heat-related deaths by 70 percent in Paris and 20 percent in London.2. As average temperatures continue to rise, so will heat-related disorders.In addition to heat waves, climate change is generally causing temperatures to rise, hot days to become more common, and summers to last longer. In cities, this problem is being compounded by the “urban heat island” effect, which can lead to temperatures being 1–5°C higher than surrounding rural areas. Exposure to extreme heat can lead to serious illness and even death, with the most vulnerable groups including children, the elderly, and those performing outdoor work or activities.An unforeseen example of human “climate canaries” has emerged in Central America and southern Mexico, where more than 20,000 sugarcane workers have died from chronic kidney disease most likely caused by extreme temperature and employment conditions that prevent adequate hydration and rest. Similar patterns are appearing in workers halfway round the world in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand.3. Climate change can exacerbate air pollution. Besides the fact that climate change and air pollution share many major common sources (fossil fuel and biomass burning), climate-driven changes in weather patterns and higher carbon dioxide levels could also worsen air quality in many regions of the world. Effects include higher frequency of stagnation events, elevated ozone concentrations, increased wildfire activity and higher levels of wind-blown dust and pollen.The harmful health effects of air pollution include a myriad of acute and chronic heart and lung diseases that will lead to lost school and work days, hospital visits, and even premature death. There is also emerging evidence that air pollution can reduce fertility and is harmful to our brains—causing development delays and autism in children, as well as reduced IQ and increased Alzheimer’s disease in adults.4. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are associated with decreased human cognitive performance.Sign up for Scientific American’s free newsletters.Elevated CO2 levels in occupied buildings are a well-known indoor air quality concern, with studies reporting associations with declines in cognitive performance and increased risk of sick building syndrome in office workers and schoolchildren. Thanks to human activities, today’s atmospheric CO2 levels (approximately 410 parts per million) are the highest they’ve been in the past 15 million years, and will likely exceed 1,000 ppm by 2100 on our current trajectory. As outdoor CO2 levels rises, background indoor levels are likely to rise too. The ramifications of this effect on public health and economic productivity are not yet well understood, but it’s worth bearing in mind that current guidelines typically recommend keeping indoor CO2 levels below 1000–1500 ppm.5. Climate change influences the transmission of vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases.Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise can affect the abundance and distribution of vectors and the pathogens they transmit in both time (duration of transmission seasons) and space (extents in latitude and elevation). For example, warming temperatures have influenced the invasion of North America by West Nile virus and the spread of malaria to higher elevations in the East African Highlands. There are also growing concerns that ancient or unknown microbes may emerge from the thawing Arctic permafrost.Additionally, changes in weather patterns and infrastructure damage following extreme weather events can enhance the spread of water- and food-borne diseases, including cholera and diarrheal diseases.6. Climate change threatens food and nutrition security.While rising temperatures and CO2 levels might initially help some crops in certain regions, the overall outlook is negative. Global food demand is expected to increase by 14 percent per decade to 2050 whereas global crop yields are expected to decrease by 1–2 percent per decade, potentially leading to food scarcity, price shocks and social unrest.The climate impacts on our food systems are multifold. For example, warming temperatures, drought and extreme weather events will cause declines in staple crops including wheat, maize, sorghum and millet (global wheat and maize yields are already beginning to decline). Rising CO2 levels and warming ocean temperatures lead to ocean acidification and collapse of coral reef ecosystems, which will exacerbate declining fish yields from overfishing and pollution. Higher atmospheric CO2 levels have been found to reduce the nutritional value of crops such as wheat, rice, barley and potato by depleting their protein and mineral contents.7. Climate change will cause mass migration and most likely increase collective violence.Military experts warn that climate impacts are “threat multipliers” that will aggravate stressors such as environmental degradation and political instability in vulnerable regions, thereby catalyzing conflict. Historically, water shortages and temperature/precipitation extremes are associated with increased conflict and sociopolitical instability; climate change may have been one of many factors that triggered the devastating Syrian civil war. In addition to civil unrest, sea level rise and extreme weather events will make certain regions become uninhabitable. By 2050, 50–250 million people could be at risk of displacement due to climate change.8. Climate change poses threats to our mental health and well-being.These impacts can occur through multiple direct and indirect pathways. For example, extreme weather events are associated with a wide range of mental health problems, including acute and post-traumatic stress disorders, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and child or spousal abuse. The destruction and loss of homelands due to climate impacts may diminish the sense of belonging and solace that people derive from their connectedness to the land (an effect that has been termed “solastalgia”). In addition, indirect mental health effects may occur following declines in personal physical health or community wellbeing.Despite all of this, it is also important to realize that tackling climate change presents “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century” and that the barriers to achieving this are primarily sociopolitical (rather than economic or technical). Actions to mitigate climate change offer a wealth of immediate and local health benefits that include reducing air and water pollution from fossil fuel combustion, designing cities to include more green spaces and with active commuters in mind, avoiding massive costs in health care and emergency relief, and ensuring energy, food and water security.Put simply, if you care about your health, you should care about climate change too.The views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

Privacy PolicyActiveAlways ActiveWhat Happened to All of the Universe's Antimatter?Anthropocene Now: Influential Panel Votes to Recognize Earth's New EpochCreative Types Reserve a Special Corner of the Brain for Dreaming BigHere are eight reasons whyEver since human-caused climate change emerged into public consciousness around the late 1980s, news stories and public awareness campaigns surrounding the topic have predominantly been accompanied by images of polar bears and melting ice, reinforcing common misconceptions that the impacts are far away in space and time and removed from our daily lives. Recent national surveys showed that 58 percent of Americans believe that they themselves will not be harmed by climate change, while 61 percent had given little or no thought to how climate change might affect people’s health.Yet mounting scientific evidence has led experts to conclude that climate change presents “the biggest global health threat of the 21st century”. A recent study demonstrated that there are 467 different pathways by which human health, water, food, economy, infrastructure and security have already been impacted by climate hazards. Here are 8 major ways that climate change harms our health today and threatens it tomorrow:1. The frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and storms are increasing due to climate change.The most well-known and visible manifestation of climate change to date is probably the increasing volatility of extreme weather events worldwide, causing deaths, injuries, debilitating and fatal diseases, and displacement. Researchers have estimated that climate-related disasters caused 2.52 million deaths globally between 1980 and 2013. Besides the growing research field of attribution studies, in which scientists can tease out the role climate change played in increasing the likelihood and/or severity of an extreme event, some have gone even further to make a direct connection to the human death toll. For example, researchers estimated that during the 2003 European heat wave, which claimed over 70,000 lives in 12 countries, climate change increased the likelihood of heat-related deaths by 70 percent in Paris and 20 percent in London.2. As average temperatures continue to rise, so will heat-related disorders.In addition to heat waves, climate change is generally causing temperatures to rise, hot days to become more common, and summers to last longer. In cities, this problem is being compounded by the “urban heat island” effect, which can lead to temperatures being 1–5°C higher than surrounding rural areas. Exposure to extreme heat can lead to serious illness and even death, with the most vulnerable groups including children, the elderly, and those performing outdoor work or activities.An unforeseen example of human “climate canaries” has emerged in Central America and southern Mexico, where more than 20,000 sugarcane workers have died from chronic kidney disease most likely caused by extreme temperature and employment conditions that prevent adequate hydration and rest. Similar patterns are appearing in workers halfway round the world in India, Sri Lanka and Thailand.3. Climate change can exacerbate air pollution. Besides the fact that climate change and air pollution share many major common sources (fossil fuel and biomass burning), climate-driven changes in weather patterns and higher carbon dioxide levels could also worsen air quality in many regions of the world. Effects include higher frequency of stagnation events, elevated ozone concentrations, increased wildfire activity and higher levels of wind-blown dust and pollen.The harmful health effects of air pollution include a myriad of acute and chronic heart and lung diseases that will lead to lost school and work days, hospital visits, and even premature death. There is also emerging evidence that air pollution can reduce fertility and is harmful to our brains—causing development delays and autism in children, as well as reduced IQ and increased Alzheimer’s disease in adults.4. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are associated with decreased human cognitive performance.Sign up for Scientific American’s free newsletters.Elevated CO2 levels in occupied buildings are a well-known indoor air quality concern, with studies reporting associations with declines in cognitive performance and increased risk of sick building syndrome in office workers and schoolchildren. Thanks to human activities, today’s atmospheric CO2 levels (approximately 410 parts per million) are the highest they’ve been in the past 15 million years, and will likely exceed 1,000 ppm by 2100 on our current trajectory. As outdoor CO2 levels rises, background indoor levels are likely to rise too. The ramifications of this effect on public health and economic productivity are not yet well understood, but it’s worth bearing in mind that current guidelines typically recommend keeping indoor CO2 levels below 1000–1500 ppm.5. Climate change influences the transmission of vector-, food-, and water-borne diseases.Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and sea-level rise can affect the abundance and distribution of vectors and the pathogens they transmit in both time (duration of transmission seasons) and space (extents in latitude and elevation). For example, warming temperatures have influenced the invasion of North America by West Nile virus and the spread of malaria to higher elevations in the East African Highlands. There are also growing concerns that ancient or unknown microbes may emerge from the thawing Arctic permafrost.Additionally, changes in weather patterns and infrastructure damage following extreme weather events can enhance the spread of water- and food-borne diseases, including cholera and diarrheal diseases.6. Climate change threatens food and nutrition security.While rising temperatures and CO2 levels might initially help some crops in certain regions, the overall outlook is negative. Global food demand is expected to increase by 14 percent per decade to 2050 whereas global crop yields are expected to decrease by 1–2 percent per decade, potentially leading to food scarcity, price shocks and social unrest.The climate impacts on our food systems are multifold. For example, warming temperatures, drought and extreme weather events will cause declines in staple crops including wheat, maize, sorghum and millet (global wheat and maize yields are already beginning to decline). Rising CO2 levels and warming ocean temperatures lead to ocean acidification and collapse of coral reef ecosystems, which will exacerbate declining fish yields from overfishing and pollution. Higher atmospheric CO2 levels have been found to reduce the nutritional value of crops such as wheat, rice, barley and potato by depleting their protein and mineral contents.7. Climate change will cause mass migration and most likely increase collective violence.Military experts warn that climate impacts are “threat multipliers” that will aggravate stressors such as environmental degradation and political instability in vulnerable regions, thereby catalyzing conflict. Historically, water shortages and temperature/precipitation extremes are associated with increased conflict and sociopolitical instability; climate change may have been one of many factors that triggered the devastating Syrian civil war. In addition to civil unrest, sea level rise and extreme weather events will make certain regions become uninhabitable. By 2050, 50–250 million people could be at risk of displacement due to climate change.8. Climate change poses threats to our mental health and well-being.These impacts can occur through multiple direct and indirect pathways. For example, extreme weather events are associated with a wide range of mental health problems, including acute and post-traumatic stress disorders, depression, drug and alcohol abuse, suicide, and child or spousal abuse. The destruction and loss of homelands due to climate impacts may diminish the sense of belonging and solace that people derive from their connectedness to the land (an effect that has been termed “solastalgia”). In addition, indirect mental health effects may occur following declines in personal physical health or community wellbeing.Despite all of this, it is also important to realize that tackling climate change presents “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century” and that the barriers to achieving this are primarily sociopolitical (rather than economic or technical). Actions to mitigate climate change offer a wealth of immediate and local health benefits that include reducing air and water pollution from fossil fuel combustion, designing cities to include more green spaces and with active commuters in mind, avoiding massive costs in health care and emergency relief, and ensuring energy, food and water security.Put simply, if you care about your health, you should care about climate change too.The views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

This was before the 2017 incident in Niger in which four American soldiers were killed on a counterterror mission and Americans were given an inkling of how far-reaching the war on terrorism might really be. I imagined a map that would highlight Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria—the places many Americans automatically think of in association with the war on terror—as well as perhaps a dozen less-noticed countries like the Philippines and Somalia. I had no idea that I was embarking on a research odyssey that would, in its second annual update, map US counterterror missions in 80 countries in 2017 and 2018, or 40 percent of the nations on this planet (a map first featured in Smithsonian magazine). As co-director of the Costs of War Project at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, I’m all too aware of the costs that accompany such a sprawling overseas presence. Our project’s research shows that, since 2001, the US war on terror has resulted in the loss—conservatively estimated—of almost half a million lives in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan alone. By the end of 2019, we also estimate that Washington’s global war will cost American taxpayers no less than $5.9 trillion already spent and in commitments to caring for veterans of the war throughout their lifetimes. In general, the American public has largely ignored these post-9/11 wars and their costs. But the vastness of Washington’s counterterror activities suggests, now more than ever, that it’s time to pay attention. Recently, the Trump administration has been talking of withdrawing from Syria and negotiating peace with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Yet, unbeknownst to many Americans, the war on terror reaches far beyond such lands and under Trump is actually ramping up in a number of places. That our counterterror missions are so extensive and their costs so staggeringly high should prompt Americans to demand answers to a few obvious and urgent questions: Is this global war truly making Americans safer? Is it reducing violence against civilians in the United States and other places? If, as I believe, the answer to both those questions is no, then isn’t there a more effective way to accomplish such goals?The major obstacle to creating our database, my research team would discover, was that the US government is often so secretive about its war on terror. The Constitution gives Congress the right and responsibility to declare war, offering the citizens of this country, at least in theory, some means of input. And yet, in the name of operational security, the military classifies most information about its counterterror activities abroad. This is particularly true of missions in which there are American boots on the ground engaging in direct action against militants, a reality, my team and I found, in 14 different countries in the last two years. The list includes Afghanistan and Syria, of course, but also some lesser known and unexpected places like Libya, Tunisia, Somalia, Mali, and Kenya. Officially, many of these are labeled “train, advise, and assist” missions, in which the US military ostensibly works to support local militaries fighting groups that Washington labels terrorist organizations. Unofficially, the line between “assistance” and combat turns out to be, at best, blurry. Some outstanding investigative journalists have documented the way this shadow war has been playing out, predominantly in Africa. In Niger in October 2017, as journalists subsequently revealed, what was officially a training mission proved to be a “kill or capture” operation directed at a suspected terrorist. Subscribe today and Save up to $129.Such missions occur regularly. In Kenya, for instance, American service members are actively hunting the militants of al-Shabaab, a US-designated terrorist group. In Tunisia, there was at least one outright battle between joint US-Tunisian forces and Al Qaeda militants. Indeed, two US service members were later awarded medals of valor for their actions there, a clue that led journalists to discover that there had been a battle in the first place. In yet other African countries, US Special Operations forces have planned and controlled missions, operating in “cooperation with”—but actually in charge of—their African counterparts. In creating our database, we erred on the side of caution, only documenting combat in countries where we had at least two credible sources of proof, and checking in with experts and journalists who could provide us with additional information. In other words, American troops have undoubtedly been engaged in combat in even more places than we’ve been able to document. Another striking finding in our research was just how many countries there were—65 in all—in which the United States “trains” and/or “assists” local security forces in counterterrorism. While the military does much of this training, the State Department is also surprisingly heavily involved, funding and training police, military, and border patrol agents in many countries. It also donates equipment, including vehicle X-ray detection machines and contraband inspection kits. In addition, it develops programs it labels “Countering Violent Extremism,” which represent a soft-power approach, focusing on public education and other tools to “counter terrorist safe havens and recruitment.” Such training and assistance occurs across the Middle East and Africa, as well as in some places in Asia and Latin America. American “law enforcement entities” trained security forces in Brazil to monitor terrorist threats in advance of the 2016 Summer Olympics, for example (and continued the partnership in 2017). Similarly, US border patrol agents worked with their counterparts in Argentina to crack down on suspected money laundering by terrorist groups in the illicit marketplaces of the tri-border region that lies between Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. To many Americans, all of this may sound relatively innocuous—like little more than generous, neighborly help with policing or a sensibly self-interested fighting-them-over-there-before-they-get-here set of policies. But shouldn’t we know better after all these years of hearing such claims in places like Iraq and Afghanistan where the results were anything but harmless or effective? Such training has often fed into, or been used for, the grimmest of purposes in the many countries involved. In Nigeria, for instance, the US military continues to work closely with local security forces which have used torture and committed extrajudicial killings, as well as engaging in sexual exploitation and abuse. In the Philippines, it has conducted large-scale joint military exercises in cooperation with President Rodrigo Duterte’s military, even as the police at his command continue to inflict horrific violence on that country’s citizenry. The government of Djibouti, which for years has hosted the largest US military base in Africa, Camp Lemonnier, also uses its anti-terrorism laws to prosecute internal dissidents. The State Department has not attempted to hide the way its own training programs have fed into a larger kind of repression in that country (and others). According to its 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, a document that annually provides Congress with an overview of terrorism and anti-terror cooperation with the United States in a designated set of countries, in Djibouti, “the government continued to use counterterrorism legislation to suppress criticism by detaining and prosecuting opposition figures and other activists.” In that country and many other allied nations, Washington’s terror-training programs feed into or reinforce human-rights abuses by local forces as authoritarian governments adopt “anti-terrorism” as the latest excuse for repressive practices of all sorts. As we were trying to document those 65 training-and-assistance locations of the US military, the State Department reports proved an important source of information, even if they were often ambiguous about what was really going on. They regularly relied on loose terms like “security forces,” while failing to directly address the role played by our military in each of those countries. Sometimes, as I read them and tried to figure out what was happening in distant lands, I had a nagging feeling that what the American military was doing, rather than coming into focus, was eternally receding from view. In the end, we felt certain in identifying those 14 countries in which American military personnel have seen combat in the war on terror in 2017-2018. We also found it relatively easy to document the seven countries in which, in the last two years, the United States has launched drone or other air strikes against what the government labels terrorist targets (but which regularly kill civilians as well): Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. These were the highest-intensity elements of that US global war. However, this still represented a relatively small portion of the 80 countries we ended up including on our map. In part, that was because I realized that the US military tends to advertise—or at least not hide—many of the military exercises it directs or takes part in abroad. After all, these are intended to display the country’s global military might, deter enemies (in this case, terrorists), and bolster alliances with strategically chosen allies. Such exercises, which we documented as being explicitly focused on counterterrorism in 26 countries, along with lands which host American bases or smaller military outposts also involved in anti-terrorist activities, provide a sense of the armed forces’ behemoth footprint in the war on terror. Although there are more than 800 American military bases around the world, we included in our map only those 40 countries in which such bases are directly involved in the counterterror war, including Germany and other European nations that are important staging areas for American operations in the Middle East and Africa. To sum up: Our completed map indicates that, in 2017 and 2018, seven countries were targeted by US air strikes; double that number were sites where American military personnel engaged directly in ground combat; 26 countries were locations for joint military exercises; 40 hosted bases involved in the war on terror; and in 65, local military and security forces received counterterrorism-oriented “training and assistance.” Get unlimited digital access to the best independent news and analysis.How often in the last 17 years has Congress or the American public debated the expansion of the war on terror to such a staggering range of places? The answer is: seldom indeed. After so many years of silence and inactivity here at home, recent media and congressional attention to American wars in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen represents a new trend. Members of Congress have finally begun calling for discussion of parts of the war on terror. Last Wednesday, for instance, the House of Representatives voted to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and the Senate has passed legislation requiring Congress to vote on the same issue sometime in the coming months. On February 6, the House Armed Services Committee finally held a hearing on the Pentagon’s “counterterrorism approach”—a subject Congress as a whole has not debated since, several days after the 9/11 attacks, it passed the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump have all used to wage the ongoing global war. Congress has not debated or voted on the sprawling expansion of that effort in all the years since. And judging from the befuddled reactions of several members of Congress to the deaths of those four soldiers in Niger in 2017, most of them were (and many probably still are) largely ignorant of how far the global war they’ve seldom bothered to discuss now reaches. With potential shifts afoot in Trump administration policy on Syria and Afghanistan, isn’t it finally time to assess in the broadest possible way the necessity and efficacy of extending the war on terror to so many different places? Research has shown that using war to address terror tactics is a fruitless approach. Quite the opposite of achieving this country’s goals, from Libya to Syria, Niger to Afghanistan, the US military presence abroad has often only fueled intense resentment of America. It has helped to both spread terror movements and provide yet more recruits to extremist Islamist groups, which have multiplied substantially since 9/11. In the name of the war on terror in countries like Somalia, diplomatic activities, aid, and support for human rights have dwindled in favor of an ever more militarized American stance. Yet research shows that, in the long term, it is far more effective and sustainable to address the underlying grievances that fuel terrorist violence than to answer them on the battlefield. All told, it should be clear that another kind of grand plan is needed to deal with the threat of terrorism both globally and to Americans—one that relies on a far smaller US military footprint and costs far less blood and treasure. It’s also high time to put this threat in context and acknowledge that other developments, like climate change, may pose a far greater danger to our country.

Last Wednesday, for instance, the House of Representatives voted to end US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and the Senate has passed legislation requiring Congress to vote on the same issue sometime in the coming months. On February 6, the House Armed Services Committee finally held a hearing on the Pentagon’s “counterterrorism approach”—a subject Congress as a whole has not debated since, several days after the 9/11 attacks, it passed the Authorization for the Use of Military Force that Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and now Donald Trump have all used to wage the ongoing global war. Congress has not debated or voted on the sprawling expansion of that effort in all the years since. And judging from the befuddled reactions of several members of Congress to the deaths of those four soldiers in Niger in 2017, most of them were (and many probably still are) largely ignorant of how far the global war they’ve seldom bothered to discuss now reaches. With potential shifts afoot in Trump administration policy on Syria and Afghanistan, isn’t it finally time to assess in the broadest possible way the necessity and efficacy of extending the war on terror to so many different places? Research has shown that using war to address terror tactics is a fruitless approach. Quite the opposite of achieving this country’s goals, from Libya to Syria, Niger to Afghanistan, the US military presence abroad has often only fueled intense resentment of America. It has helped to both spread terror movements and provide yet more recruits to extremist Islamist groups, which have multiplied substantially since 9/11. In the name of the war on terror in countries like Somalia, diplomatic activities, aid, and support for human rights have dwindled in favor of an ever more militarized American stance. Yet research shows that, in the long term, it is far more effective and sustainable to address the underlying grievances that fuel terrorist violence than to answer them on the battlefield. All told, it should be clear that another kind of grand plan is needed to deal with the threat of terrorism both globally and to Americans—one that relies on a far smaller US military footprint and costs far less blood and treasure. It’s also high time to put this threat in context and acknowledge that other developments, like climate change, may pose a far greater danger to our country.

29,Climate Change,Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?,1s29q9r,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/02/18/we-need-a-fossil-fuel-primer-because-the-media-isnt-telling-us-enough-about-climate-change/,We Need A Fossil Fuel Primer Because The Media Isn't Telling Us Enough About Climate Change | CleanTechnica,"Published on February 18th, 2019 | by Carolyn FortunaFebruary 18th, 2019 by Carolyn Fortuna Carbon from fossil fuels has a distinct “signature” — its composition of heavier and lighter atoms of carbon. The smaller the ratio of heavier to lighter carbon atoms, the higher the proportion of carbon from fossil fuels. Over the years, the ratio of heavy to light carbon atoms has decreased as the overall amount of CO2 has increased. This information tells scientists that fossil fuel emissions are the largest contributor of atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the pre-industrial era.The US Environmental Protection Agency states that current levels of the greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide — in our atmosphere are higher than at any point over the past 800,000 years, and their ability to trap heat is changing our climate in multiple ways. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.Look around your neighborhood. Why are we starting to see wind turbines, solar panels, or electric vehicles nearly everyday in our regular travels? That’s because these and other renewable energy devices are getting cheaper and more abundant by the day. Technology and cost of production for renewables are coalescing in favor of the consumer. And the result is that the demand for coal, oil, and natural gas is falling.What will happen as the demand for fossil fuels diminishes?The price for fossil fuels will fall, and fall, and fall, to the point where it won’t be profitable any longer for companies to mine for coal or dig oil wells. They won’t be able to obtain a profit by extracting that fuel. The fossil fuel companies will fail before 2035, according to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change.Renewable energy sources will become common in every home in the US well before fossil fuel prices fall precipitously. By taking over a small, but significant share of the market, renewables will force producers to slash costs to stay competitive. There will be a delicate dance in which fossil fuels will become really inexpensive while renewable technologies become commonplace. Why?Fossil fuel companies will want to sell any coal, oil, or natural gas they own before these become worthless — known as stranded assets. Investors are moving away from fossil fuels as it becomes increasingly evident that continued expansion of oil, coal, and gas is exacerbating global conflicts and prompting corruption. The processes involved in fossil fuel production, distribution, and burning threaten biodiversity, clean water, and air. They infringe on the rights of indigenous peoples and vulnerable countries and communities.As more and more individuals buy electric vehicles, fewer gasoline stations will be needed. When people find how warm, efficient, and convenient electric heat pumps are, they’ll turn away from natural gas to heat their homes. Electricity that is available from solar panels and home batteries will be so affordable and reliable that people won’t want to buy power from a coal- or gas-fired power plants.As recently as 2018, there were a number of significant developments on climate change.If climate change was so in-our-face in 2018, why did the media do such a lackluster job in reporting it? Okay, you’ll say, the media did better in 2018 than 2017 in covering the topics on the list above. Maybe so, but it wasn’t enough.Public Citizen wanted to know which media coverage of topics relevant to climate change garnered significant attention in 2018 — like extreme weather events — and the extent to which media outlets explicitly connected them to climate change. In 2018, only 8% of newspaper articles, 5% of television transcripts, and 16% of online news articles mentioned solutions or mitigation in pieces discussing climate change. Public Citizen determined that news media have a major role to play in providing key information about the crisis and solutions to inform those actions. One way to report on the subject, they say, is simply to connect everyday coverage to climate where relevant. Another is to cover the climate crisis directly, including by discussing how we can mitigate it.But a larger question looms — Why do so few media outlets thoroughly cover climate change, which we know is directly related to putting too much carbon into the atmosphere (CO2) when we burn coal, oil, and gas or cut down forests?“The tragedy in the lives of most of us is that we go through life walking down a high-walled lane with people of our own kind, the same economic situation, the same national background and education and religious outlook. And beyond those walls, all humanity lies, unknown and unseen, and untouched by our restricted and impoverished lives.”—Florence Luscomb, architect and suffragist (6 Feb 1887-1985)When we are debating the future of energy, it’s important to know the sources of the information that we use to make our decisions, who’s authoring the information, and what their opinion and bias might be. In that way, we can form our own opinions about what we think the future of the energy system should be. It’s not enough to say, ‘My friends have always trusted it. That’s good enough for me.’Media celebrities, partisan think tanks, and special interest groups funded by fossil fuel and related industries raise false doubts about the truth of global warming.They minimize the significance of climate change. They insist that the US economy depends of the production of fossil fuels. They lobby for policies that limit liability from mining and burning pollution. They attempt to weaken existing pollution standards.Constant media misinformation misleads and confuses the public about the growing consequences of global warming — and makes it more difficult to implement the solutions we need to effectively reduce the human-made emissions that cause global warming.At a time when we need sound climate science and evidence to set the record straight, including resources to help each of communicate the real facts about global warming, the media is all-too-often mute.Why is that?Way back in 2012, the Columbia Journalism Review pointed out some research that said the press routinely quotes think tanks that bash clean energy policies and technologies. The article also noted that these media outlets also fail to mention that they receive significant funding from fossil fuel interests.Do you think that the following statistics have changed in the last couple of years, or not? Conduct a little informal sleuthing yourself: how often do you hear media mouthpieces questioning climate science without disclosing their funders? Let us know in the comments section at the bottom what trends you think are happening in 2019 about media transparency, climate change, and fossil fuel interests.When was the Columbia Journalism Review study? 2007-2011How many media outlets did they study? 10 organizations, including the Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise InstituteHow much $$ was spent on the media by fossil fuel industries? Around $16.3 millionWhich fossil fuel companies/ foundations were responsible?

Only 6% of the time.How frequently did the news outlets use only an organization’s name? 53%How often would they describe an organization’s ideology?Which outlets disclosed a group’s industry ties most frequently?Why is it important for disclosure of media sources when fossil fuels are discussed? The power of think tanks to move pro-fossil fuels industry messaging is much more effective when they appear to be unbiased or neutral institutes. When media aren’t transparent about their funding, they dilute trust in authenticity and accuracy in climate science information. This really seems like planned deception, doesn’t it?What sources are reliable for information about the fossil fuel industry — and why? The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was cited by Columbia Journalism Review as an independent institute —  a federally funded research laboratory. Its mission is to make sure the public and other parts of government know the facts about the research and development behind the clean energy industry.Public Citizen, which conducted the more recent 2018 study of the media and climate change reporting, suggests that producers, editors, or reporters who want to know whether or how to discuss climate change in the context of extreme weather could look to Climate Central, in particular its Climate Matters program, and Climate Nexus, including its Climate Signals project.And you can call out your favorite media outlet every time you perceive that they’re not fully transparent about their funding sources.

Mike Groene will present his bills on student discipline and state school aid to the Legislature’s Education Committee, which he chairs, during public hearings Monday and Tuesday that Nebraskans can attend or view via livestream.Hearings both days will begin at 1:30 p.m. Central Time in Room 1525 of the State Capitol in Lincoln. To watch and listen, click the Nebraska Educational Television logo on the Legislature’s homepage at nebraskalegislature.gov, then scroll to and click on the appropriate link on netnebraska.org/basic-page/television/live-demand-state-government.Monday’s hearing will feature Groene’s Legislative Bill 147, which would allow teachers or administrators to physically restrain a student who “becomes physically violent toward himself or herself, a teacher, an administrator or another student” or displays “destructive behavior toward school property.”The bill, a revised version of one Groene offered in 2017, defines acceptable physical restraint and would exclude it in such cases from the state’s definition of “corporal punishment.”It also would protect a teacher or administrator in that situation from “legal action or administrative discipline” if he or she acted “in a reasonable manner” while protecting school property or “defending himself or herself, another teacher or administrator or a student.”On Tuesday, Groene will present LB 695, which would make several changes to the state school aid formula intended to relieve pressure on property tax rates in small-town and rural K-12 districts.Among other provisions, the bill would restore “foundation aid” to the formula to ensure that each district receives a basic amount of state aid per student. Some districts also receive “equalization aid” — largely limited to larger districts in recent years — when the formula determines a district’s educational “needs” are greater than its financial “resources.”LB 695’s “statement of intent,” which will offer further explanation of its provisions, will be posted online before Tuesday’s hearing, according to Education Committee staff. To access progress and all available documents on any bill, enter its number on the Unicameral homepage.Also on Tuesday’s Education Committee hearing agenda is LR 5CA, a proposed constitutional amendment by Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon that would allow no more than 33 percent of total K-12 school funding to come from property taxes.Committee members also will hear LB 662, introduced by Sen. Curt Friesen of Henderson, which would repeal the state school aid formula in its entirety on July 1, 2022. The basis of the formula was put in place in 1990, when senators passed LB 1059.

Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at the University of Michigan.Highest on the list of concerns was the risk impaired drivers may pose to children—with nearly half of parents saying this was a significant worry. A recent study found that more than half of people taking cannabis for chronic pain report driving while high.""Medical marijuana has become legal in the majority of states but there is wide variation in state and local policies that regulate the location and operation of dispensaries,"" says poll co-director Sarah Clark, M.P.H.""The majority of parents feel strongly that they should give local input on decisions regarding where dispensaries may open and also support limitations on how close dispensaries could be to children's areas.""Aside from the top concern involving drivers under the influence, some parents also worried about the possibility of a child finding and ingesting edible marijuana inadvertently left behind by a dispensary customer (48 percent), and teens having easier opportunities accessing marijuana (49 percent.) Other dispensary concerns included setting a bad example for kids (45 percent) and bringing violent crime to the area (35 percent).Three quarters of parents indicated general support for legal medical marijuana, including one third of parents who support the option for children. Just 26 percent of parents opposed medical marijuana.At the same time, most parents agreed that dispensaries should be banned within a certain distance of elementary schools, middle and high schools, and daycare centers. Forty-four percent of parents also believed dispensaries should not be close to places of worship. Support for such bans was equally strong among both mothers and fathers, younger and older parents, and parents of higher and lower income.""Most parents seem to understand that marijuana can have legitimate medical benefits, but parents also have major concerns about the risks that medical marijuana dispensaries might pose to children,"" Clark says. ""When it comes to where dispensaries are located, many parents feel that any area near children is too close for comfort.""Most parents (77 percent) agreed that medical marijuana dispensaries should have the same regulations as liquor stores for where they can be located. Meanwhile, 52 percent of parents said dispensaries should have the same rights as other businesses. Nearly all parents (90 percent) felt dispensaries should undergo inspections to ensure they are following all regulations.Nearly half of parents (45 percent) said that medical marijuana is legal in their state, and 24 percent knew there was at least one medical marijuana dispensary in their community. Only 20 percent reported that their state or community has regulations about where dispensaries can be located, while 59 percent did not know if such regulations exist.While most parents wanted to be consulted about locating a dispensary near their child's school or daycare, this may prove difficult, Clark says. There is no consistent state or local framework to regulate the location and operations of dispensaries. Some states may have added legal complexities differentiating the sale of medical versus recreational marijuana.It may also be confusing about whether parents need to contact elected officials or commissions, and if they should focus on the state or local level when an application is filed for a new dispensary.

The three city commissioners voted on Wednesday in favor of two vendors to supply voting machines and electronic poll books that some estimate to cost upwards of $60 million. The commissioners chose the ExpressVote XL voting system by Election Systems & Software, LLC and KNOWiNK LLC to provide electronic poll books. The city last upgraded its voting machine system in 2002. City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart, who attended the meeting, said the selection process lacked openness with voters and appeared to favor Express Voting. She also questioned where the additional funds to pay for the system will come from. “There were many, many issues in this process that are troubling and deeply flawed,” Rhynhart said, adding, “This process is not a good one for taxpayers.” Several civic groups — Neighborhood Networks, Citizens for Better Elections, MarchOnHarrisburg, IndivisiblePhiladelphia, Turn PA Blue — said in a released statement after the vote that they were committed to challenging the decision. “If we cannot trust that our votes are accurately and securely counted, our democracy is in jeopardy,” the groups said. City Commissioner Chairwoman Lisa Deeley, a Democrat, blamed the rushed selection process on the state-mandated deadline to set up a new system by 2020. The commissioners, however, aim to have the new system up and running for November’s general election so they are not using it for the first time in a presidential election. “If we do not act and act now, we risk not being able to have an election next year,” Deeley said. Negotiations for final contracts and costs with the vendors remain ongoing. But upfront costs for the voting machines were expected to cost between $20 and $27 million, while the electronic poll books were estimated to cost $3 million, Deeley said. Over the next decade, the new system was expected to cost another $13 million. Training and new warehouse space for the machines were expected to cost another $7 million. Only $22 million has been set aside for a new voting system in the 2020 fiscal year budget. Mike Dunn, a spokesman for Mayor Jim Kenney, said in an email that the administration will support the City Commissioners in negotiating final contracts with the two vendors in preparation for launching the new system in November. “We’re hopeful that this extensive effort will meet the Commissioners’ plan to have new machines in place in time for the 2019 General Election, and to certainly meet the Governor’s mandate for the selection of new systems by year’s end and implementation in 2020,” Dunn said. The new voting machines will offer a screen for residents to vote on, similar to an iPad screen, Deeley said. The machines also will produce voter-verified paper ballots that are able to be audited, which is not possible with the city’s current machines. “Every vote will be auditable,” Deeley said. In addition to Deeley, the other city commissioners were Anthony Clark, a Democrat, and Vice Chair Al Schmidt, a Republican. All three face re-election this year. A handful of residents also condemned the selection process at the meeting, saying the commissioners ignored accessibility concerns for the handicapped, security issues, and more. Resident Rich Garella called the process “tainted” and called on commissioners to vote for a voting system that used hand-marked paper ballots. “This could have been an open process with public input and transparency and accountability,” he said. “With our democracy at risk … we need smart decisions on new voting systems in Philadelphia but today it appears the voters are going to be given short shrift,” added resident Stephen Strahs. Auditor General Eugene DePasquale recently said he was investigating the city’s selection process. Before the vote on Wednesday, DePasquale said in an email that, “I hope the commission has fully vetted the RFP [request for proposal] process and is taking into account the need to ensure the new system offers strong security and provides access to voters with disabilities.” The city solicited proposals between Nov. 30 and the end of December. A total of seven vendors responded — three voting machine vendors and four electronic poll book vendors. Only three vendors are currently certified to provide voting systems in the state. A selection committee recommended the commissioners choose from two vendors for each system. A selection committee made recommendations last week that further negotiations continue with the four total vendors who received the highest overall scores for voting machines and electronic poll books. For voting machine systems, the selection committee recommended the commission choose between Express Vote XL and Dominion Voting Systems Inc.; for electronic poll books, KNOWiNK LLC and Tenex Software Solutions. In a letter dated Feb. 16 to the commissioners, Interim Procurement Commissioner Monique Nesmith-Joyner recalculated the scores for the vendors, but did not recommend one vendor over another. ExpressVote XL scored slightly higher than Dominion Voting — 3.7 to 3 respectively — for the voting machine systems; while Tenex Software Solutions scored higher than KNOWiNK LLC — 4.27 to 4.16 respectively. Gov. Tom Wolf mandated that all counties put in place new voting systems by 2020 that provide a paper record of votes cast.

20,Banned Books,Should Parents or Other Adults Be Able to Ban Books from Schools and Libraries?,1s20q10r,http://www.teenink.com/opinion/social_issues_civics/article/131038/Against-Banning-Books/,Against Banning Books | Teen Ink,"Please enter the email address that you use to login to TeenInk.com, and we'll email you instructions to reset your password.The Catcher in the Rye. The Scarlet Letter. Huckleberry Finn. Harry Potter. The Diary of Anne Frank. Animal Farm. To Kill a Mockingbird. The Da Vinci Code. The Grapes of Wrath. These literary classics have been vital to the education of many, especially children and adolescents. These great novels both teach important values and educate children about world affairs and classic themes. Unfortunately, each of these novels has been banned at one point in time. Many of these classic stories have been banned because of sexual references, racial slurs, religious intolerance, or supposed witchcraft promotion. Although some may consider these books controversial or inappropriate, many English classes have required us to read these books. Like the teachers that assigned us these books, I believe that even controversial books can ultimately boost, not deter, our educational wealth. I oppose book banning for three main reasons. First, I believe that education should be open to everyone. Everyone should have an opportunity to read any literature of their choosing and form his or her own opinions based on the reading. Micah Issitt lists ""three basic rights covered under the freedom of the press: the right to publish, the right to confidentiality of sources, and the right of citizens to access the products of the press."" My second reason specifically addresses the last right stating that citizens should have access to the press. The government should not restrict books from being published or interfere into personal affairs as this is an infringement of the First Amendment. Finally, I believe that parents should monitor what their own children read, but not have the authority to ban other children from reading these novels. For these reasons, I conclude that the government should play no role in the issue what citizens do and do not read, and that book restriction should remain a solely private matter. B At first glance, the debate over banning books appears unimportant. Nevertheless, this debate has divided our nation into those who favor censoring books to protect their impressionable adolescents, and those who argue that education should be open for everybody without interference from the government in restricting the publishing and accessing of these books. Issitt argues that censoring books violates the First Amendment, stating that ""citizens must be free to seek out any media, regardless of content, that they deem appropriate for entertainment, information, or education. Denying the rights of the consumer, in any area, is one of the hallmarks of authoritarianism."" While I do not equate banning books with ""authoritarianism,"" we do endorse Issitt's belief that individual citizens have the right to choose, under their own discretion, what books to read. The First Amendment protects the freedom of expression and speech, and by prohibiting certain messages, the government clearly infringes upon public rights. On the other hand, Healey claims that censorship does not ""repress information that teenagers and children are exposed to,"" but merely gives parents the rights to educate their children in the ways they deem appropriate. Though I concede that parents do have the right to monitor what their children read, they do not have the right to remove books from public libraries or monitor what other children in the city read. Healey attempts to persuade readers that ""censorship of books should not be about silencing voices on important topics, but about steering young people toward the best possible literature;"" however, she fails to specify what constitutes as ""the best possible literature."" Some of ""the best possible literature"" also happen to cause the most controversy, including Huck Finn, Harry Potter, The Scarlet Letter, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Those who protest against these books have clearly not studied them in depth. For example, the main theme in Huckleberry Finn focuses not on advocating racism, as some suggest, but proving that race does not define a person's intelligence or capability for compassion. Even Healey admits that ""concerned parents and community members react without taking the time to closely investigate the books they want banned."" While I agree that parents should play an active role in educating their children and as their primary guardians, have the legal right to monitor what their children read, I disagree that this legal right extends to controlling what other children in the neighborhood read as well. Prohibiting children from reading a book will not enhance their moral values. Rather, banning a book more likely will increase curiosity for reading it. I also empathize with parents who ban books with controversial or uncomfortable subjects because they are unsure as to how their children will react or how to explain such topics. A good way to discuss these subjects with children is to read books with various views on the subject so that children can experience multiple points of view before forming their own opinions. Healey herself agrees that such a method ""might help young people better understand the world they live in, the human condition, and issues they face in their culture."" As Healey stated, parents also tend to ban books based on ""moral grounds, although some books have been condemned for their perspectives on civic values and history."" For this very reason, the general public should read these books. Our society, especially our younger children, needs to read these books since fully understanding a topic requires knowledge of both sides. If we choose to disregard even a highly unpopular opinion, we intentionally choose to live in ignorance, only partially educated in a topic we claim to know so well. Without a doubt, if we continue to ban books and ignore what some consider taboo topics, we hinder ourselves and our children from finding ways to solve society's problems, thus hampering the development of our nation as a whole. Many conservative groups make the argument that the books that have been banned have material that is inappropriate, immoral or contradicting the beliefs they have ingrained in their children and/or their society. Take for consideration the controversial books that tackle difficult, touchy social issues like homosexuality. Books like ""Heather Has Two Mommies,"" by Leslea Newman and ""Daddy's Roommate"" by Michael Willhoite (both books written for youth with gay parents) were shot down by conservative groups because they attempted to educate children about homosexuality, an issue parents felt needed to be taught to their respective children by them. While this may seem like a valid argument, really it is just skirting around the actual issue. Book-banning cases usually concern the protection of children and their innocence, but all that is happening is sheltering parents showing an awkward avoidance of their children's confrontation with uncomfortable matters. It is not only selfish, but also harmful to the overall education of their children. This act of prohibiting books is just the parents way of evading of the conversation with their child about these sensitive issues. These two books are issues that Healey brings up in her argument on how groups were upset about the way these books informed their children of homosexuality. Homosexuality and other touchy social issues are part of every day life, and for a group to attempt to censor this subject from younger society is almost absurd; these issues are not monstrous and the censorship of them not only shows prejudice but lack of respect. Banning books seems to be the most public solution for a private matter- not everyone should have to suffer restrictions because one group feels uncomfortable with the book. That being said, there are often books that contain graphic and often highly inappropriate material; I do consent that these books should be censored at the discretion of the parent, or anyone involved however, no one is forcing books upon others, so we should not be forced to remove them. Other groups would say that it's also the duty of the government to regulate these books to protect concerned citizens and their families, but I would have to disagree. It's the exact opposite of the government's role- our private lives, the books we read, should be regulated and controlled by us. Banning books from public congregations is not what the government was intended to do. Topics that seem socially outlawed in public, let alone published, have been banned because their immoral content may have a negative affect on younger children. In these books, authors doesn't promote or encourage bad behaviors, they prepare their readers for some of the real world challenges. The child would never be able to learn these things if the book was banned, nor be able to form his or her own opinion about that certain topic. Healey discusses that the book, 33 Snowfish, a ""dark story of three teenage runaways who are victims of various forms of abuse..."" by Adam Rapp may be an unsuitable way to educate children on these timely topics. However, having these stories banned all together would just further shelter a child whose parents may not be willing to discuss these issues with them at all. Even though these books center around scary topics, they are educating children on real life matters that they will be exposed to once they venture into the world themselves. Healey goes on to make the point that the books should not be banned as well, since it is a matter of private opinion not one to be made by the public libraries of a community. She suggests that schools should ""inform parents about the kinds of books they offer children"" in their libraries and classrooms instead of banning them. With the knowledge that some of these books have to offer, children can learn how not to act and what can be the consequences if they do misbehave. This learning experience could turn around with the help of a parent and pass a positive affect over the child. Clearly, banning books not only hinders a child's educational development but also leaves them unaware of the true state of the world. Books do not simply impart general information; they heavily influence a child, the future generation. Without regular access to books, both adults and children could not form sound opinions, only narrow-minded ones. Both advocates and opposers of book banning agree that ""books are powerful instruments."" Otherwise, a debate on the subject would neither have arisen nor lasted so long. Because books ""can be used to...inculcate values and transmit ideology, and to stimulate the imagination,"" as Healey suggests, any person should remain free to select his or her reading material. This personal issue of selecting reading material has no relation to the government. On the contrary, government action interferes with individual education, a primary American value. Ultimately, children can learn personal responsibility in determining which books to regard and which to discard. In the future, these children will become well-educated adults who can benefit the American society.This article has 37 comments.Favorite Quote:Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.Copyright © 2019 Teen InkWhich of your works would you like to tell your friends about?

45,Video Games and Violence,Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?,1s45q2r,http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/BrandonHuffman/20190215/336688/Can_states_tax_violent_video_games.php,Gamasutra: Brandon Huffman's Blog - Can states tax violent video games?,"Recently, a lawmaker in Pennsylvania proposed a law to tax the sale of video games rated M or AO by ESRB at 10%. This would be in addition to the sales tax already imposed in Pennsylvania (which I am going to refer to as “PA” because it’s too much to type over and over).According to GameSpot:Explaining the bill last year, Quinn [ the proponent of the bill ]  said violent video games might be an element in the rise of school shootings in America. “One factor that may be contributing to the rise in, and intensity of, school violence is the material kids see, and act out, in video games,” he said.With all due respect to Rep. Quinn (R), this is a dumb solution to that problem.As the ESRB spelled out in their statement to Variety:Numerous authorities — including scientists, medical professionals, government agencies, and the US Supreme Court — found that video games do not cause violence. We encourage Pennsylvania legislators to work with us to raise awareness about parental controls and the ESRB video game rating system, which are effective tools to ensure parents maintain control over the video games played in their home.It doesn’t really matter, though, because the law is almost certainly an unconstitutional restriction on free speech under the First Amendment. Video games are expressive speech, entitled to First Amendment protection.As previously explained in this post we wrote about the First Amendment:Where a regulation changes depending on the content of the speech, courts apply “strict scrutiny.” This is a much harder test for the regulation to pass.Courts will look at whether (a) the restriction serves a compelling government interest (not just important) and (b) is narrowly tailored.Narrowly tailored, in this context, is more than just “no greater than necessary.” Instead, it must advance the interest of the government, not be overinclusive (regulate more than is required), underinclusive (fail to include all that would be required to accomplish the purpose – which would show the government didn’t care enough about the purpose for it to be “compelling) or unduly burdensome (it must be the least restrictive alternative in order to fulfill the purpose).Some government interests have been clearly established as compelling: maintaining stability in the political system, ensuring criminals do not profit from crime, protecting the rights of individuals from discrimination, protecting voters from harassment, etc.Even with a compelling interest, a content-based restriction fails if it is not narrowly tailored.If the law fails to advance the purpose, it will fail…If the law is overinclusive, it will fail…If the law is underinclusive, it will fail…If the law creates an undue burden, it will fail…A violent video game tax almost certainly fails to pass this test. Even accepting that a regulation like this serves a compelling government interest in reducing youth violence (which I don’t think is true, given the science), it isn’t narrowly tailored to that purpose.It is unclear that a tax advances the apparent purpose of discouraging youth from accessing M-rated video games. Will a kid who wants to play Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) really be dissuaded by a $66 price instead of a $60 price? I doubt it.The PA proposal is overinclusive. It purports to be a tax on violent games, but bases itself on the ESRB’s rating system. An M-rated game might have no violence at all. It could be sexual. It could just include the word “fuck” a lot.The PA proposal is also underinclusive. It ties the tax to the ESRB rating. Not every game receives an ESRB rating. Only games for which the manufacturer (e.g., Sony), retailer (e.g., Toys R Us – RIP) or another cog in the distribution machine requires rating go through the process. So, the proposal leaves out many violent video games.I would also argue the PA bill creates an undue burden on retailers and distributors to track and remit the tax based on the ESRB rating (which is not indexed in an easily accessible way) or pay a 150% penalty.In short, the PA bill is bunk. If it passed, it would be squashed in the courts (unless it reached the Supreme Court and SCOTUS overturned its own precedent – which could happen, but would not, IMO, happen to favor a tax over free speech).It probably won’t pass, though. Similar bills in Connecticut and Missouri have all failed to pass – probably because a majority of the legislators didn’t want to waste time passing laws that are completely ineffective and unconstitutional.

Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). (Cheryl Senter/AP)Sen. Amy Klobuchar is refusing to hop on the Medicare-for-all train. That makes her the only major Democratic presidential contender to stray significantly from an ambitious and sweeping plan to overhaul the country’s health insurance system that her primary opponents have embraced.The Minnesota Democrat’s emergence as the race’s centrist candidate has increasingly highlighted the idealism-vs.-pragmatism debate that’s also dividing Democrats inside Congress. Even as progressives push for a Sen. Bernie Sanders-style bill to replace private health coverage with a government-run system, Democratic House leaders have tried to keep the focus on improving existing health-care programs.That’s the approach preferred by Klobuchar, who said Monday in a CNN town hall that she favors offering more people a Medicaid-type plan – something Democrats tried to include in the Affordable Care Act but ultimately gave up on over GOP objections that it would give the government an oversized role in the nation's health-care system.“That is a way to provide a public alternative that’s real … so that we can bring down the rates,” Klobuchar said. “And then we can look at other options, but we have to start somewhere. And I think we could do that much more immediately.”CNN senior Washington correspondent Jeff Zeleny:Washington Post reporter Paul Kane:All the other senators officially seeking the Democratic presidential nomination — Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and, most recently, Sanders of Vermont — have co-sponsored Medicare-for-all as envisioned in a bill introduced by Sanders in 2017.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who reintroduced his measure just last week. It would allow states to start selling a government-backed Medicaid plan on their individual insurance marketplaces, which people could purchase with the help of Obamacare premium subsidies.Because the plans would be available to higher-income people, they could come with copays and deductibles, but premiums would be capped at 9.5 percent of a family’s income. Klobuchar suggested this incremental approach -- versus a total Medicare-for-all-style overhaul -- would be the fastest and most realistic way of achieving universal coverage“What we need is to expand coverage so that people can have a choice for a public option, and that’s a start, all right?” she told a questioner at the town hall. “You could do it many ways, but you could also do it with Medicaid, something I don’t think we’re talking about enough as a potential solution.”NBC News's Andrea Mitchell: Bloomberg News's Sahil Kapur: Justice Democrats spokesman Waleed Shahid:Border Patrol agents detain a 14-year-old from Guatemala who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border alone in January.

36,Electoral College,Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections?,1s36q9r,https://thinkprogress.org/the-constitution-of-the-united-states-has-failed-797a657eab28/,The Constitution of the United States has failed – ThinkProgress,"What kind of nation allows the loser of a national election to become president — and then does it again 16 years later?What kind of nation retains an electoral process that was originally designed to inflate the influence of slaveholders?What kind of nation permits its Congress to write a time bomb into law that periodically forces rival factions into a game of chicken that could wreck the world economy?What kind of nation fights a civil war over the question of whether people of African descent are people or property, and then looks the other way when the loser ignores the resolution of that war? What kind of nation waits until 1965 to guarantee black people’s right to vote?Americans speak of our Constitution as if it were a religious text. To label a law “unconstitutional” is not simply to say that it violates some procedural rule or legal technicality, it is to label it fundamentally unAmerican. To do so is to question the values of any lawmaker despicable enough to support such a law, and to suggest that those values are at odds with who we are as a nation.But our Constitution has not served us nearly as well as we would have been served by other systems adopted by our peer nations. Nor has it lived up to the expectations of its drafters.Now, our country is facing a man of superlative ignorance. A racist. An admitted sexual assaulter of women. A man poised to violate the Constitution the very instant he takes the oath of office. A man who openly encouraged Russia’s efforts to usher him into the White House. A man who owes his election to the underhanded efforts of deep state actors within our nation’s internal police agency. A man who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. And the Constitution has placed this man in the White House.Liberalism is not built for moments like these.The Constitution gave Donald Trump command of the world’s most powerful military and an nuclear arsenal that can eradicate all life on Earth. It let him name a racist as our nation’s top enforcer of its laws. It let him use his office to sell hotel rooms to foreign diplomats. The Electoral College has voted. Trump will be our next president. This is what the Constitution hath wrought.It did this because our Constitution remains the product of a compromise with moral monsters who believed that human beings could be owned as property. It did this because our Constitution offers no guarantee, or even much in the way of likelihood, that the men and women elected to lead the country will share the preferences of the nation as a whole. It did this because our Constitution fosters voter ignorance. It did this because our Constitution can be gamed — and was gamed quite successfully by the Republican Party.There are competing theories for why America has an Electoral College. One, offered by Alexander Hamilton in an advocacy document written to persuade the nation to support its new Constitution, is that it would allow “men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to” the presidency to determine who should hold that crucial job.Another theory, which Hamilton did not include in his sales pitch for the Constitution, is that the Electoral College was part of the price northerners had to pay in order to form a union with states whose entire economic model depended on slavery.Regardless of which theory you prefer, it is undeniable that the Electoral College now serves the second goal of giving a leg up to racists far better than it serves the first. In 2016, the electors themselves are almost entirely obscurities — party activists who are typically selected more for their willingness to cast a vote for their party’s candidate than for their ability to analyse the qualities best adapted to the presidency. Even if they’d wanted to elect someone other than Donald Trump as the president, they lack the stature necessary to quell unrest that would likely ensue.What the Electoral College has done is steal the presidency from the woman who won it, and given it to a man who openly campaigned on racism and nativism. It’s the sort of outcome that would make many of the Founding Fathers smile — the ones who demanded a terrible price as the cost of Union.To be sure, there were good men at the Philadelphia convention that drafted the original Constitution. There were men who, as Gouverner Morris said in a speech to the convention, saw slavery as a “nefarious institution” and “the curse of heaven on the States where it prevailed.” There were also delegates from large states who stood for the very simple proposition that a vote from Virginia should count exactly the same amount as a vote from Delaware.Yet these good men traded away their convictions. The new Constitution explicitly protected slavery. It allowed slave states to count each slave as three-fifths of a person for purposes of calculating representation in the House and the Electoral College, even though those slaves could not vote. And it created the Senate, an anti-democratic body which today counts each person in Wyoming as 67 times more important than each person in California.The good men in Philadelphia agreed to these terms in service of a singular goal: peace through Union. As Yale’s Akhil Amar explains, the Articles of Confederation, the loose alliance of states that preceded the Constitution, conceived of the United States as “an alliance, a multilateral treaty of sovereign nation-states.” Pennsylvania was as much a separate a sovereign nation from Virginia as Russia is today separate from China. The Articles largely bound these nations into a pact of mutual commerce and defense.Nevertheless, the framers were well-versed in European history. They knew of the frequent warfare which plagued that continent, and they came to see Union as the best defense against a similar fate. As Amar describes their concerns, “each nation-state might well raise an army, ostensibly to protect itself against Indians or Europeans, but also perhaps to awe its neighbors. America would then recreate continental Europe — borders, armies, dictators, chains, and all.”The threat from such armies, moreover, was twofold. As Hamilton warned, these armies could themselves be turned against the people, becoming “engines of despotism” that would lead the states in a “progressive direction toward monarchy.” Standing armies were a threat, not just to rival states, but to the people of their home states.More than two centuries later, the Founding Fathers’ belief that their Constitution would keep America from keeping a standing army is quaint. The United States has the most powerful military in the world, in addition to a network of federal police, intelligence agencies, and an entire cabinet department devoted to internal security. Perhaps these institutions will balk if Trump orders them to impose the kind of tyranny Hamilton feared, but the Constitution sure did not stop them from being built.It also didn’t save us from war among the states. The early history of the United States was an uneasy peace broken by regional conflicts and near-misses — the Nullification Crisis, Bleeding Kansas, John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry. And then the war came, a four year conflict that killed between 2 and 3 percent of the nation’s entire population.Our Founding Fathers traded away democracy. They traded away the fundamental principle that every American’s vote is equal. They traded away every person’s inalienable right to freedom. And they’d traded it away for nothing.If you go to the American South today, and you speak to a black person over the age of 50, you are most likely speaking to someone who was born into an apartheid state. If you speak to someone over the age of 70, that person probably had their voting rights stolen from them by a white supremacist regime.This is not ancient history. These are flesh and blood Americans who live and work among us. America became a liberal democracy in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. Free and fair elections, at least at the nationwide level, are not something we have all that much experience with.It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When the Civil War was won, the victors demanded a new covenant. They wrote slavery out of our Constitution. They wrote freedmen’s right to vote into the Constitution. And, in the most sweeping and radical change that has ever been written into the Constitution, they completely reworked the balance of power between the states and the people.The Fourteenth Amendment declared, for the first time in American history, that everyone born in the United States is a citizen and that every citizen enjoys certain rights solely because they are an American (without this amendment, states were free to violate the Bill of Rights). It provided that no one can be stripped of their liberty without appropriate legal process, and it insisted on equal treatment along racial lines.Yet, for much of the next century, the South gleefully ignored these guarantees. “Black codes” relegated freedmen to a status that was often difficult to distinguish from actual slavery. Black men were arrested for minor or even fabricated offenses, then rented out to whites as cheap labor. Jim Crow segregated African Americans and stripped them of their vote. And if anyone dared to question white supremacy, they were quieted by terrorist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which often worked in close coordination with the state.There are many villains in this saga. The resilience of white supremacist government in the South occurred because the Supreme Court largely sat on its hands, often explicitly embracing the South’s most odious practices. It happened because the rest of the nation lost its nerve, abandoning Reconstruction for a peace built from the bones of black Americans. It happened because of immoral men willing to use murder as a tool of political control. But white supremacy also thrived because of the Founding Fathers.Remember that compromise? The one that gave Alabama exactly the same number of senators as New York? It also prevented Congress from enacting a single civil rights law from 1875 until 1957.The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was one of Congress’ final serious attempts to reconstruct the South. Enacted just over a year before Rutherford B. Hayes sold out black America in order to secure his presidency, the Act banned racial discrimination by “inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement.” It survived eight years before it was struck by the Supreme Court.Though new civil rights legislation sometimes passed the House — five such bills did so in the 12 years following World War II — none of this legislation survived contact with the Senate. The same Senate malapportionment that, for many years, gave slave states parity with free states in Congress’ upper house, despite the fact that the free population in the North significantly exceeded that of the South, now gave the Jim Crow states a far louder voice in the Senate than their population warranted.That thumb on the scale, combined with the filibuster, was enough to keep civil rights bills from becoming law.Nearly six decades after the Senate finally ended its blockade of all civil rights laws, malapportionment continues to advantage conservatives and stymie progressives. To give just one example, the 54 senators who make up the current Republican majority (and who effectively kept the Supreme Court in Republican hands by preventing Chief Judge Merrick Garland from being confirmed to fill its vacant seat) represent fewer than 150 million people. The 46 senators in the Democratic majority, meanwhile, represent more than 170 million.What’s more, according to the group FairVote, “the 46 Democratic caucus members in the 114th Congress received a total of 67.8 million votes in winning their seats, while the 54 Republican caucus members received 47.1 million votes.”Even setting aside the undemocratic Senate, the United States is an outlier among our peer democracies because of the unusual number of roadblocks our Constitution places before any bill that seeks to become law.America’s separation of powers, which typically requires consensus among the president, two houses of Congress, and the Supreme Court — not to mention the cooperation of congressional leaders and committee chairs who have outsized power to hold up legislation — is generally taught to schoolchildren as if it were divine wisdom delivered to the Founding Fathers at Mt. Sinai. But it is a highly unusual system, in no small part because so many democracies that adopted similar models failed.In his seminal essay “The Perils of Presidentialism,” the late Yale political scientist Juan Linz warned about the danger inherent in a constitutional system, like the one in the United States, which elects the nation’s chief executive separately from its legislature. In such a system, it is easy for two irreconcilable factions to each gain control of at least one veto point that enables them to halt the legislative process. Moreover, because both sides “derive their power from the votes of the people in a free competition among well-defined alternatives,” there’s no “democratic principle” that can be cited to break such an impasse.“In some such situations in the past, the armed forces were often tempted to intervene as a mediating power.”As one Republican lawmaker defended his party’s actions in the lead up to the 2013 government shutdown, “I too won an election. You want me to just disregard all of my voters and all of the promises that I made and how I got elected?” The shutdown happened because both our Democratic president and our Republican House had an equal claim to democratic legitimacy.The shutdown is an unhappy memory, but it is hardly the worse case scenario for what can happen if the president and the legislature face a unsolvable disagreement. It is “no accident,” Linz recalled of other nations that have faced such an impasse, “that in some such situations in the past, the armed forces were often tempted to intervene as a mediating power.”The United States, fortunately, did not reach the point where Obama and former House Speaker John Boenher (R) needed to start counting their loyalists among the nation’s generals and admirals. But there’s still plenty of evidence of the issues that Linz is referencing in U.S. government.Our stagnant, imperfect democracy leaves many problems — crumbling infrastructure, a job market that still has not fully recovered from the recession — unaddressed or underaddressed. It also denies voters much of the feedback that they need in order to cast their ballots wisely.A likely reason why Republicans felt hornswoggled when President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law is that they had good reason to believe that such a thing wasn’t possible. After all, every Democratic president since Harry Truman (as well as Republican Richard Nixon) promised a universal health plan. Yet, for more than six decades, they failed. Failed health care reform plans were as American as baseball and capitalism. It’s hard to blame Obama’s opponents for thinking they were safe from the horrors of affordable health care for the less fortunate.Meanwhile, the Republican Party’s fiscal proposals, which include deep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, a plan to charge seniors up to 40 percent more for inferior health coverage, and big tax cuts for the highest earners, are unpopular with the general public, unpopular with Republicans, and unpopular even with most Republican donors. Pretty much the only people who like these proposals are rich Republican donors.And yet, somehow, the American people just elected a Republican Congress that is poised to enact these unpopular proposals and a president (albeit not with anything close to a majority vote) who is likely to sign them into law. How can this be? Why did so many voters condemn themselves to policies that they hate?Vox’s Sarah Kliff offers one explanation for this dichotomy. In a recent trip to a Kentucky town that voted overwhelmingly for Trump, despite the fact that many of its residents depend upon Obamacare for health coverage, she heard a frequent refrain. In Kliff’s words, these voters “just couldn’t fathom the idea that this new coverage would be taken away from them.”In one of the most heartbreaking interviews in Kliff’s piece, a voter whose husband is waiting for a liver transplant was able to get health insurance for her family thanks to Obamacare. Yet she told Kliff that she backed Trump because “I guess I thought that, you know, he would not do this, he would not take health insurance away knowing it would affect so many people’s lives.”In 2012, a Democratic super PAC convened a focus group to assess whether Republican candidate Mitt Romney’s support for the GOP’s fiscal proposals could be used against him. Yet the focus group’s reactions to these proposals resembled the conversations Kliff had with Trump voters in Kentucky. When the super PAC “informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan — and thus championed ‘ending Medicare as we know it’ — while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing.”The Constitution of the United States, in other words, built a nation where elections frequently don’t have significant consequences. In doing so, it lulled many voters into a false sense of security. It taught them not to believe politicians’ promises because, chances are, those promises won’t be implemented anyway.And then, when a party actually does bring about sweeping radical change, the same voters seem flabbergasted that the government they elected actually did what it said it would do.One good thing that can be said about unified Republican control of Congress and the White House is that it is likely to break this cycle. If Republicans succeed in repealing Obamacare, replacing Medicare with a voucher program, slashing Medicaid, cutting Social Security benefits by 20–50 percent, and using the savings to put more money in the wealthiest Americans’ pockets, then it will be hard to pretend that elections don’t matter. Or that voters shouldn’t pay attention to a party’s ideas before they cast a ballot for its candidates.But the biggest danger arising from unified Republican government isn’t that it will enact bad policies that might be repealed later. It is that the GOP will use its moment at the apex of power to ensure that it can never be displaced from this position.In many ways, this process began long before Donald Trump even declared his candidacy. Over the last several years, voter suppression laws thrived in Republican-led states. Meanwhile, these laws — many of which are unconstitutional — have survived judicial review thanks to a GOP-dominated Supreme Court that even went so far as to gut a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.There are many good things in our Constitution. But they don’t mean very much if the Supreme Court is unwilling to enforce them.There are also strong arguments that partisan gerrymandering violates either the First Amendment’s protections against viewpoint discrimination, or the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection under the law. Yet Republicans on the Supreme Court also thwarted efforts to combat such gerrymandering in court. These decisions, combined with geographic factors that advantage Republicans, prevent Democrats from enacting legislation even when they win. In 2012, for example, Democratic House candidates won nearly 1.4 million more votes than Republicans. Yet the GOP kept control of the House.There are many good things in our Constitution. But they don’t mean very much if the Supreme Court is unwilling to enforce them.Once Trump adds another Republican justice to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the Court’s first orders of business will probably be a long-pending dispute that seeks to hobble public sector unions’ ability to fund themselves — it is highly likely that Trump’s nominee will provide the fifth vote to inflict this wound on unions. That not only means lower wages for government workers in the long run, but also means Democrats will lose much of the political infrastructure that these unions provide.And enabling voter suppression while carving up unions is really only a small part of the damage a truly partisan Supreme Court could inflict upon democratic governance. In the worse case scenario, a Supreme Court stacked with Trump justices could recreate the early twentieth century, when minimum wage laws, child labor laws, and much of the New Deal were blocked by an ideological Court that did not feel especially constrained by the text of the Constitution.Despite all the obstacles laid by voter suppression and similar tactics, Democrats could claw their way back into congressional majorities and the White House — only to discover that their efforts to roll back Trump era legislation will be struck down by Republicans on the Supreme Court.If America holds a free and fair election in 2020, and if that election places a Democrat back in the White House, there’s a danger that liberals will learn the wrong lessons from four years of Donald Trump.To be sure, some of the right lessons are obvious and unlikely to be missed. The Electoral College, for example, is a pathology that will have few informed defenders outside of the party that has twice seen its losing candidate declared the winner.But conservatives also spent much of the last century spinning a fairly consistent narrative about what’s wrong with the American system of government. In their mythology, the problem with the United States is that it is too democratic. That it is too easy for the federal government to enact new programs and regulations. And that the way to save America is to erect barriers that make it harder for elected officials in Washington to govern.This narrative is likely to have some appeal to liberals reeling from four years of Trump. The idea that Obamacare, or Medicare, or Social Security, could have been saved if only there’d been more veto points in our system will be appealing. We are likely to see just how bad things can get if government is able to move quickly.If Brexit does prove to be a calamity, British voters will at least know who to blame.But liberals will shoot themselves in the foot if they succumb to the appeal of a left-libertarian alliance whose sole goal is to keep future Presidents Trump from doing too much, too quickly. In the short term, they are likely to freeze government in the weakened state that four years of Donald Trump will produce. In the long term, such a single-minded alliance would exacerbate the constitutional defects that brought America to the point we find ourselves in today.Today, as President-elect Donald Trump waits to take the oath of office, the nation of Great Britain faces a similar crisis. The Brexit campaign, which appealed to much of the same racism and nationalism that drove Trump’s campaign, is victorious. A web of alliances that helped end centuries of warfare within Europe is now at risk. British workers are expected to “make £38 less a week than their E.U. counterparts by the year 2030 once the country leaves the E.U.”The British parliamentary system, which typically places a single party in charge of the entire government, did not prevent these outcomes. But if Brexit does prove to be a calamity, British voters will at least know who to blame. It was a Tory prime minister who allowed the Brexit vote, and a Tory government will manage the nation’s transition out of the European Union.There can be no doubt in London that elections have consequences. And no further doubt about who foisted these consequences upon the British people.And, if Tory candidates campaign on a plan to dismantle their nation’s universal health care system, British voters will know damn well that they better believe that these candidates will actually do it.They won’t vote, as so many Americans did, to dismantle our social safety net by accident.",1,9,Against,Against,Against,0,Against,"['Against', 'Against', 'Against']","Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections? The Constitution of the United States has failed – ThinkProgress What kind of nation allows the loser of a national election to become president — and then does it again 16 years later?What kind of nation retains an electoral process that was originally designed to inflate the influence of slaveholders?What kind of nation permits its Congress to write a time bomb into law that periodically forces rival factions into a game of chicken that could wreck the world economy?What kind of nation fights a civil war over the question of whether people of African descent are people or property, and then looks the other way when the loser ignores the resolution of that war? What kind of nation waits until 1965 to guarantee black people’s right to vote?Americans speak of our Constitution as if it were a religious text. To label a law “unconstitutional” is not simply to say that it violates some procedural rule or legal technicality, it is to label it fundamentally unAmerican. To do so is to question the values of any lawmaker despicable enough to support such a law, and to suggest that those values are at odds with who we are as a nation.But our Constitution has not served us nearly as well as we would have been served by other systems adopted by our peer nations. Nor has it lived up to the expectations of its drafters.Now, our country is facing a man of superlative ignorance. A racist. An admitted sexual assaulter of women. A man poised to violate the Constitution the very instant he takes the oath of office. A man who openly encouraged Russia’s efforts to usher him into the White House. A man who owes his election to the underhanded efforts of deep state actors within our nation’s internal police agency. A man who lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. And the Constitution has placed this man in the White House.Liberalism is not built for moments like these.The Constitution gave Donald Trump command of the world’s most powerful military and an nuclear arsenal that can eradicate all life on Earth. It let him name a racist as our nation’s top enforcer of its laws. It let him use his office to sell hotel rooms to foreign diplomats. The Electoral College has voted. Trump will be our next president. This is what the Constitution hath wrought.It did this because our Constitution remains the product of a compromise with moral monsters who believed that human beings could be owned as property. It did this because our Constitution offers no guarantee, or even much in the way of likelihood, that the men and women elected to lead the country will share the preferences of the nation as a whole. It did this because our Constitution fosters voter ignorance. It did this because our Constitution can be gamed — and was gamed quite successfully by the Republican Party.There are competing theories for why America has an Electoral College. One, offered by Alexander Hamilton in an advocacy document written to persuade the nation to support its new Constitution, is that it would allow “men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to” the presidency to determine who should hold that crucial job.Another theory, which Hamilton did not include in his sales pitch for the Constitution, is that the Electoral College was part of the price northerners had to pay in order to form a union with states whose entire economic model depended on slavery.Regardless of which theory you prefer, it is undeniable that the Electoral College now serves the second goal of giving a leg up to racists far better than it serves the first. In 2016, the electors themselves are almost entirely obscurities — party activists who are typically selected more for their willingness to cast a vote for their party’s candidate than for their ability to analyse the qualities best adapted to the presidency. Even if they’d wanted to elect someone other than Donald Trump as the president, they lack the stature necessary to quell unrest that would likely ensue.What the Electoral College has done is steal the presidency from the woman who won it, and given it to a man who openly campaigned on racism and nativism. It’s the sort of outcome that would make many of the Founding Fathers smile — the ones who demanded a terrible price as the cost of Union.To be sure, there were good men at the Philadelphia convention that drafted the original Constitution. There were men who, as Gouverner Morris said in a speech to the convention, saw slavery as a “nefarious institution” and “the curse of heaven on the States where it prevailed.” There were also delegates from large states who stood for the very simple proposition that a vote from Virginia should count exactly the same amount as a vote from Delaware.Yet these good men traded away their convictions. The new Constitution explicitly protected slavery. It allowed slave states to count each slave as three-fifths of a person for purposes of calculating representation in the House and the Electoral College, even though those slaves could not vote. And it created the Senate, an anti-democratic body which today counts each person in Wyoming as 67 times more important than each person in California.The good men in Philadelphia agreed to these terms in service of a singular goal: peace through Union. As Yale’s Akhil Amar explains, the Articles of Confederation, the loose alliance of states that preceded the Constitution, conceived of the United States as “an alliance, a multilateral treaty of sovereign nation-states.” Pennsylvania was as much a separate a sovereign nation from Virginia as Russia is today separate from China. The Articles largely bound these nations into a pact of mutual commerce and defense.Nevertheless, the framers were well-versed in European history. They knew of the frequent warfare which plagued that continent, and they came to see Union as the best defense against a similar fate. As Amar describes their concerns, “each nation-state might well raise an army, ostensibly to protect itself against Indians or Europeans, but also perhaps to awe its neighbors. America would then recreate continental Europe — borders, armies, dictators, chains, and all.”The threat from such armies, moreover, was twofold. As Hamilton warned, these armies could themselves be turned against the people, becoming “engines of despotism” that would lead the states in a “progressive direction toward monarchy.” Standing armies were a threat, not just to rival states, but to the people of their home states.More than two centuries later, the Founding Fathers’ belief that their Constitution would keep America from keeping a standing army is quaint. The United States has the most powerful military in the world, in addition to a network of federal police, intelligence agencies, and an entire cabinet department devoted to internal security. Perhaps these institutions will balk if Trump orders them to impose the kind of tyranny Hamilton feared, but the Constitution sure did not stop them from being built.It also didn’t save us from war among the states. The early history of the United States was an uneasy peace broken by regional conflicts and near-misses — the Nullification Crisis, Bleeding Kansas, John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry. And then the war came, a four year conflict that killed between 2 and 3 percent of the nation’s entire population.Our Founding Fathers traded away democracy. They traded away the fundamental principle that every American’s vote is equal. They traded away every person’s inalienable right to freedom. And they’d traded it away for nothing.If you go to the American South today, and you speak to a black person over the age of 50, you are most likely speaking to someone who was born into an apartheid state. If you speak to someone over the age of 70, that person probably had their voting rights stolen from them by a white supremacist regime.This is not ancient history. These are flesh and blood Americans who live and work among us. America became a liberal democracy in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act. Free and fair elections, at least at the nationwide level, are not something we have all that much experience with.It wasn’t supposed to be this way. When the Civil War was won, the victors demanded a new covenant. They wrote slavery out of our Constitution. They wrote freedmen’s right to vote into the Constitution. And, in the most sweeping and radical change that has ever been written into the Constitution, they completely reworked the balance of power between the states and the people.The Fourteenth Amendment declared, for the first time in American history, that everyone born in the United States is a citizen and that every citizen enjoys certain rights solely because they are an American (without this amendment, states were free to violate the Bill of Rights). It provided that no one can be stripped of their liberty without appropriate legal process, and it insisted on equal treatment along racial lines.Yet, for much of the next century, the South gleefully ignored these guarantees. “Black codes” relegated freedmen to a status that was often difficult to distinguish from actual slavery. Black men were arrested for minor or even fabricated offenses, then rented out to whites as cheap labor. Jim Crow segregated African Americans and stripped them of their vote. And if anyone dared to question white supremacy, they were quieted by terrorist groups like the Ku Klux Klan, which often worked in close coordination with the state.There are many villains in this saga. The resilience of white supremacist government in the South occurred because the Supreme Court largely sat on its hands, often explicitly embracing the South’s most odious practices. It happened because the rest of the nation lost its nerve, abandoning Reconstruction for a peace built from the bones of black Americans. It happened because of immoral men willing to use murder as a tool of political control. But white supremacy also thrived because of the Founding Fathers.Remember that compromise? The one that gave Alabama exactly the same number of senators as New York? It also prevented Congress from enacting a single civil rights law from 1875 until 1957.The Civil Rights Act of 1875 was one of Congress’ final serious attempts to reconstruct the South. Enacted just over a year before Rutherford B. Hayes sold out black America in order to secure his presidency, the Act banned racial discrimination by “inns, public conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places of public amusement.” It survived eight years before it was struck by the Supreme Court.Though new civil rights legislation sometimes passed the House — five such bills did so in the 12 years following World War II — none of this legislation survived contact with the Senate. The same Senate malapportionment that, for many years, gave slave states parity with free states in Congress’ upper house, despite the fact that the free population in the North significantly exceeded that of the South, now gave the Jim Crow states a far louder voice in the Senate than their population warranted.That thumb on the scale, combined with the filibuster, was enough to keep civil rights bills from becoming law.Nearly six decades after the Senate finally ended its blockade of all civil rights laws, malapportionment continues to advantage conservatives and stymie progressives.

53,Corporate Tax Rate & Jobs,Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?,2s53q7r,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annemarieknott/2019/02/21/why-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-tcja-led-to-buybacks-rather-than-investment/,Why The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act (TCJA) Led To Buybacks Rather Than Investment,"The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) of December 2017 had two main provisions affecting corporate taxes. First, it reduced corporate taxes, changing them from a graduated structure with a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%. Second, it changed taxation of foreign profits. Previously these profits weren’t taxed until repatriated, so companies kept their profits abroad. In fact, an estimated $2.8 trillion of foreign profits had been accumulated. The TJCA changed the law such that profits are taxed only where earned. To facilitate the transition between the two systems, the TJCA offered a tax “holiday” on pre-2018 foreign profits at a reduced rate of 15.5% on liquid assets (and 8% percent on other assets). The underlying logic for the TCJA was that allowing companies to keep a greater share of profits, would stimulate investments in long term growth. Instead, the dominant company response to the TCJA was stock buybacks. For the first three quarters of 2018, buybacks were $583.4 billion (up up 52.6% from 2017).  In contrast, aggregate capital investment increased 8.8% over 2017, while R&D investment growth at US public companies increased 12.5% over 2017 growth.What are buybacksStock buybacks (also known as share repurchases) refer to company purchases of stock from its existing shareholders. These shares are purchased at the market price, then returned to the treasury, thereby reducing the number of shares outstanding. Because there are fewer shares, earnings per share (EPS) goes up, and because stock price is based on multiples of EPS, stock price typically goes up as well.Accordingly, buybacks are a way of returning excess cash to shareholders. The other way to return cash to shareholders is by paying dividends. The advantage of buybacks over dividends, is they are more flexible, in that they don’t imply a permanent commitment to return cash to shareholders. Prior to a 1982 rule change by the SEC, dividends were the most common means of returning cash to shareholders. Since that time, buybacks have risen steadily, such that by 1997 buybacks exceeded dividends, as shown in the figure below. The figure shows the trend toward buybacks was in effect long before the TCJA. The TJCA merely put more cash in the hands of companies, triggering a surge in buybacks.Buybacks Have Grown Since 1982 This surge created a backlash culminating in the The Accountable Capitalism Act, a federal bill introduced by Senator Elizabeth Warren in August 2018.  “The surge in corporate buybacks is driving wealth inequality and wage stagnation in our country by hurting long-term economic growth and shared prosperity for workers,"" said Sen Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) one of the bill’s co-sponsors, in a news release.The record on buybacks and growthIs Senator Baldwin right that the surge in buybacks is hurting economic growth?   The short answer is, no.   A study by MSCI looking at the impact of buybacks on long-term growth, concluded, “Contrary to concerns expressed by many observers, we found no compelling evidence of a negative impact from share buybacks on long-term value creation for investors overall. In each of the areas we examined, beginning with MSCI ESG Ratings but also including CAPEX, R&D, new debt issues, and, most importantly, value creation, the companies that were most actively distributing cash to their investors were also the strongest companies.”Why did the TCJA trigger buybacks rather than investment?To answer the question of why buybacks, it’s helpful to focus on R&D, because R&D is a leading investment—it creates opportunities.  Capital investment then follows to exploit those opportunities.  In short, the reason the TCJA didn’t increase R&D investment is that most companies were already over-investing in R&D.Companies who conduct R&D, can be characterized by how productive their R&D is, using a measure called RQ.  Because RQ is based on simple economic principles relating a company’s R&D to its revenue growth, it can be used to compute the optimal level of R&D spending for each company. This is the level of investment that generates the maximum profits.  The calculation involves a standard piece of math called a partial derivative.  In essence, it’s an exercise in marginal returns—determining the point at which an additional dollar spent on R&D begins to reduce profits.RQ is estimated from financial data, so it’s possible to compute the optimal R&D investment for all public companies, and compare it to companies’ actual investment.   The comparison is captured in the figure below.  The horizontal axis captures companies’ optimal R&D, while the vertical axis captures their actual investment.  Each company is represented by a dot.  If companies are spending optimally, they should line up on the diagonal.  What you can see however, is that very few companies are spending optimally.  In fact, fewer than 4% of companies are within plus or minus 10% of their optimum.Most Companies Overinvest In R&DMost people complain that companies are under-investing in R&D, but in fact, that’s true for only 33% of companies. On average, those companies are leaving $36 million on the table each year in foregone profits. This is the amount their profits would increase if they increased their R&D investment 10%. They might be able to invest even more over time, but typically a 10% increase is what a company can comfortably absorb in one year.The more common problem is actually over-investment.   Fully 63% of companies are spending beyond optimal levels. Not only are there more of these companies—almost twice as many, but their mistake is far more costly. On average these companies are leaving $258 million of foregone profits on the table. This is the amount they could increase profits by cutting R&D to the optimal level.This is why the TCJA hasn’t increased growth. Providing companies with more cash will only lead to investment and growth if companies have profitable investment opportunities, and lack cash to exploit them. The fact buybacks were growing before the TJCA was implemented, is evidence they lacked these opportunities.Given that companies are already investing R&D at optimal levels, if we want to stimulate growth, companies first need to become more productive with their R&D. Increasing their RQ packs two growth punches:  it increases growth from each dollar of R&D at current investment levels, and it increases the level of optimal R&D investment. Once companies generate greater growth from their R&D, capital investment can follow.Anne Marie Knott is the Robert and Barbara Frick Professor in Business at Washington University in St. Louis, founder and Chief Scientist at amkANALYTICS, and author of How Innovation Really Works.I’m a former engineer and program manager at Hughes Aircraft Company, who turned academic, and am now the Robert and Barbara Frick Professor in Business at WashU in St L...This is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Why The Tax Cuts And Jobs Act (TCJA) Led To Buybacks Rather Than Investment The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) of December 2017 had two main provisions affecting corporate taxes. First, it reduced corporate taxes, changing them from a graduated structure with a maximum rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%. Second, it changed taxation of foreign profits. Previously these profits weren’t taxed until repatriated, so companies kept their profits abroad. In fact, an estimated $2.8 trillion of foreign profits had been accumulated. The TJCA changed the law such that profits are taxed only where earned.

WAAY 31 talked with firearm experts who argue that right comes with a powerful responsibility.In this WAAY 31 I-Team investigation, we take a close look at what it takes to get a concealed carry gun permit. We examine not only the right to get a permit, but the responsibilities that go along with it.Last month in our viewing area, a 10-year-old boy found a gun in his father’s vehicle and accidentally killed his twin sister. That was just outside the Shoals in St. Joseph, Tennessee.Back here in Alabama, a student took a gun to Blossomwood Elementary and accidentally shot another student in the hand. The student who brought the gun took it without his father's knowledge. That man is a felon who clearly never should have had the gun in the first place.We had already been talking with a former FBI agent about what he considers gun owners’ responsibilities that go above what Alabama law requires.We also talked with a woman who started carrying a gun for her own protection.“I literally realized how much goes on in this city that I didn’t know went on,” Susan Sims told WAAY 31.We caught up with Sims at Larry’s Pistol and Pawn. Her eyes were wide-open to the crime happening around her in Huntsville when she started working as a gun seller and pawn broker.She wasted no time getting a concealed carry permit “to follow the law because I do like to carry a gun in my vehicle when I travel.”Sims insists getting a concealed carry permit is only the first step. “I think you have to be a responsible firearm owner,” she told us. “Just going out with your friend or significant other to shoot, they may not teach you the safety you need to know.”A recent Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health study shows seven states -- West Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama and Tennessee -- have a disproportionate share of unintentional firearm deaths.“I’m a retired FBI agent. I spent 32 years in the FBI,” Ed Marshman told WAAY 31.Marshman puts his FBI experience to use training people at his shooting MTC Training Range. It's just off I-65 near the Alabama Tennessee state line.“Obviously, I believe in firearms,"" Marshman said. ""I like firearms. I don’t want to have a lot of gun control regulations.” Still, Marshman sees a serious need for education and training even if Alabama law doesn’t make it mandatory.""You need to school yourself and to learn,"" he told WAAY 31. ""You've got a responsibility to yourself, to your family, to your neighbors and to the community.""The most recent information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows in 2016 in Alabama, there were 18 accidental deadly shootings. In Tennessee, there were 17.Compare that to the fifty state average of nearly ten.""Alabama requires a permit to carry a weapon concealed,"" Marshman explained. ""However, there is no training requirement. There is no classroom training requirement. And there is no minimum qualification course you have to shoot.""Alabama issues more concealed carry permits than any other state. About 20 percent of adults have permits. The basic requirements: you must be a resident, be 18 and agree to background checks. Like the vast majority of other states, there's no real obstacle standing in the way of your 2nd amendment right to bear arms.“Everybody has the right to carry and have it,"" Marshman said. ""But, along with that right comes responsibility.”Across the state line, Tennessee does require a concealed carry permit course. Part of that training includes learning about the use of deadly force under Tennessee law.""The law tells you what you can do,"" Marshman told us. ""More importantly, you need to know what you should do.""Knowledge could save your life or keep you out of legal trouble. Marshman’s mantra: avoid, escape, defend.He gave us this example: ""You're in the back of your house in the kitchen. Two guys bust through your front door. Yes, legally you can stay there. But, you shouldn't. You should, if you can go out the back door and go to your neighbor's house, you should leave."" Marshman underscored that advice. ""The only gunfight that I can guarantee you won't lose is the one you don't get into.""Training helps you avoid shooting an innocent bystander and figure out who’s the real bad guy. Muscle memory may be your best weapon. ""Can you shoot on the move?,"" Marshman asked. ""Can you shoot quickly? Can you shoot one-handed? Can you shoot in low-level light conditions?""Back in Huntsville, Susan Sims backed up what Marshman said. “Training and practice,"" she said, tops her list of shooting priorities. ""Don’t come and take a class and think that’s all the training that you need and you’re protected. You’re not.”Gun safety is so important to Sims, she now teaches it. Sims says a concealed carry permit comes with a powerful responsibility. “If you have a firearm, you have to keep other people safe.”Sims also told us gun safes are critically important, especially with children in homes. But, she adds having access to your gun is also critical. She recommends a biometric safe you can activate with your fingerprint.FeaturedThuFriSatSunMonTueWedThursday, May 23, 2019Loading Events...Friday, May 24, 2019Saturday, May 25, 2019Sunday, May 26, 2019Monday, May 27, 2019Tuesday, May 28, 2019Wednesday, May 29, 2019✔Submit Your Event 1000 Monte Sano Blvd Huntsville, AL 35801 USA(256) 539-3131 All content © copyright WAAY.

You can’t even leave full-time education now until 18.Nevertheless, an unholy alliance of Remainers and the Left love the idea because they erroneously think it would give them a permanent electoral advantage.

After over a decade of lobbying and at least three years of protracted negotiations, an overwhelming majority of the United Nations General Assembly voted to adopt the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in late March.The treaty prohibits the transfer of conventional arms where the state knows that the weapons will be used to commit international crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity and attacks on civilians. During the negotiations over the final text of the ATT, Australian foreign minister Bob Carr reiterated Australia’s humanitarian concerns and its intention to advance the agenda of civilian protection. In that same statement, Carr indicated the trade and use of light weapons, stating that it undermines the “security, stability and welfare of communities around the globe”.Australia showed effective global leadership in advancing the protection of civilians through its extended diplomatic efforts to secure a robust treaty. If it is truly committed to this agenda, the government should make every effort to lead international efforts to limit the use of drone strikes when Australia takes the presidency of the United Nations Security Council in September.Small arms and light weapons have acted as force multipliers in intra-state and inter-state conflict, amplifying violence and the threat to civilians. The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) notes that:Small arms facilitate a vast spectrum of human rights violations, including killing, maiming, rape and other forms of sexual violence, enforced disappearance, torture, and forced recruitment of children by armed groups.The devastating effects of small arms on civilian populations are self-evident, and the ATT is a significant step towards diminishing their availability.UNODA describes small arms and light weapons as facilitators of terrorism and notes that their use contributes to the creation of fear and insecurity. This is one of the reasons their trade should be closely regulated and that we should seek to eliminate their circulation. But small arms and light weapons are not the only forms of military hardware that induce terror and create fear. The use of drones severely compromises human security and has a detrimental impact upon the psychological and physical wellbeing of civilian populations. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has collated data on the casualties and fatalities incurred as a result of United States drone strikes. They estimate that over 1,000 civilians have died in the past decade in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia as a result of drone strikes, including over 200 children. On April 23, Farea Al-Muslimi, a young man from Wessab in Yemen, made a statement to the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights. In this statement he explained the impact that drone warfare has had upon his life and the lives of his family, friends and neighbours. Six days prior to his presentation, a missile released by a US drone hit Wessab, aimed at Hameed Al-Radmi, a man who was reportedly affiliated with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The inhabitants of Wessab, in Al-Muslimi’s words, wanted:to question him and find out what he was doing wrong so they could put an end to it. They still don’t have an answer to that question. Instead, all they have is the psychological fear and terror that now occupies their souls.Others have described how drones have hit rescuers, meaning that people are increasingly less likely to assist those wounded by the weapons for fear of multiple strikes, and those attending funerals.The US government has never publicly outlined its doctrine on the use of drones, but a cache of leaked documents suggests that threat identification happens on an ad-hoc basis and often using sketchy intelligence at best. Over half of the targets in Pakistan during the periods covered by the leaked documents (2006-8 and 2010-11) were local militants unaffiliated with transnational organisations, who therefore posed little or no threat to the US. The effects of these strikes on civilian populations are devastating. In his testimony, Al-Muslimi repeatedly referenced the terror experienced by his friends and neighbours. The widespread fear and insecurity is caused by the scale of the devastation left behind: after one strike, Al-Muslimi recounts that “the bodies were so decimated that it was impossible to differentiate between those of children, women and their animals”. On the Security Council, Australia has a platform from which to challenge the use of drones and to demand accountability for the destruction they cause. In the light of the government’s commitment to civilian protection - recently put to such good use in the ATT negotiations - it is imperative that the government use its position to speak out about drone usage in the same way that it spoke out against small arms. Both forms of weaponry have the same effects: they both cause human insecurity; they both spread fear; they both destroy the livelihoods of communities and take the lives of individuals. Effective protection of civilians cannot be achieved solely by taking small arms out of the equation in localised conflicts. Civilian protection requires a firm commitment to human rights, including the right to live free from fear of arbitrary violence. As long as drone strikes continue unchallenged, and as long as the destruction that they rain upon civilian populations is not held up to international scrutiny, a commitment to the protection of civilians will be a hollow commitment indeed.

This is available throughout Libraries NI branches, providing free access to the 35 book collection which has been chosen by young people and health experts to help support young people with difficult feelings and experiences that can affect their wellbeing.The books have all been chosen by young people and health experts. They contain information and advice as well as personal stories about dealing with feelings such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, stress, bullying and difficult life experiences. Some suggest useful self-help techniques, while others are personal stories, graphic novels and fiction.I asked Nicola for some advice for young people preparing for forthcoming GCSE and A Level exams.When should students start making a revision timetable for this summer’s exams??The sooner you start, the more opportunities to be in control. Getting the timetable sorted removes a level of worry. So, ideally do it as soon as you know your actual exam time-table (but don't panic if you're later.) The timetable shouldn’t just be about revision, but also about planning relaxation, learning and practising an anti-panic strategy, planning food requirements and improving sleep.Some parents ban socialising in the lead-up to exams, but you suggest relaxation is an important aspect of revision – why? ""Wellbeing is more important than ever when you're really busy and needing top performance. Relaxation is not something that should wait until after exams: it should take place every day. Break up revision time with healthy recreation, including physical exercise, going outside, seeing friends, going on trips and reading for pleasure. Having breaks actually improves learning and brain function and we benefit from making good choices in those breaks.Should social media be allowed during exam time? ?Yes. There's no good reason to ban it completely. Of course, social media can be distracting; we can use it too much and there are unhealthy ways of using it as well as healthy ways. But if you can be self-controlled and keep your phone and social media out of sight when you're working and manage to prioritise work, there's no reason not to use it in recreation time.However, if it's making you feel bad or distracting you, put your device completely out of sight. Make sure you get enough physical exercise, sleep, face-to-face chat and that you're on top of your work. After that, social media is a valid treat.Is too much pressure placed on teenagers at too young an age, with constant examinations and expectations? ?I don't think it's about age. I think most adults would find the pressure huge, too. Yes, I think the exam system is overloaded and the stakes are too high, with society and media putting enormous pressure on teenagers. All we can do as parents is not exacerbate that pressure.How best can you turn stress into a positive during exams? ?Stress is good; too much stress or stress at the wrong times is what is bad. It's an entirely natural biological process which has evolved to make us super-perform when we need to. If we weren't a bit 'stressed' about an exam, we could be too laid back to succeed. We need adrenalin to push us to do more than we otherwise can.However, we must try to reduce stress when we are not about to need it and also have strategies to manage feelings of panic.How do you advise young people and their parents on how to cope with disappointing exam results?Only when we fail do we get the chance to grow resilience, by seeing if there was something we could have done differently and then picking ourselves up to try again. I advise parents to reinforce the message that exams are not the most important thing in the world. So many leaders in many fields didn't do well in exams. Sometimes, even if you work really hard, things can go wrong. But you can try again, or there's always another route to a fulfilling, successful, wonderful life.:: For further advice, including example revision timetables and instruction on how to make your own, visit Nicolamorgan.com.

5,Milk - Is It Healthy,Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?,2s5q8r,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/29/white-gold-the-unstoppable-rise-of-alternative-milks-oat-soy-rice-coconut-plant,White gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks | Food | The Guardian,"How wellness upstarts spoiled milk’s healthy reputation – and built a billion-dollar industry from juicing oats and nuts. By Oliver Franklin-Wallis In the spring of 2018, New York was gripped by a sudden, very particular and, for some, calamitous food shortage. Gaps appeared on grocery shelves. Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of oat milk.It wasn’t just New York, in fact. The entire US was suffering from a shortage of Oatly, a Swedish plant milk whose rapid rise from obscure digestive health brand to the dairy alternative of choice had caught even Oatly by surprise. Since its US launch in 2016, Oatly had gone from supplying a handful of upscale New York coffee shops to more than 3,000 cafes and grocery stores nationwide. The company had ramped up production by 1,250%, but when I spoke to CEO Toni Petersson in late summer, they were still struggling to meet demand. “How do we supply when the growth is this crazy?” Petersson said.Fortunately, when it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternative alternatives. Visit your local supermarket and you will find a refrigerated aisle overflowing with choice: almond milk, hazelnut milk, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew – and that’s just the nuts. Coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea – you name it, somewhere a health-food startup is milking it. London tube stations are filled with ads for new plant milks – or rather, “mylks” (EU law prevents dairy alternatives from using the word milk if it isn’t produced by a lactating mammal). Cookbooks dedicate entire chapters to blending and straining your own. Sainsbury’s now stocks around 70 different options. There are the wellness punks (Rebel Kitchen, Rude Health), the dairy puns (Malk, Milkadamia, Mooala) and the nourishers (LoveRaw, Good Karma, Plenish). “People are just looking at every nut that exists and seeing if they can squash it into a milk,” said Glynis Murray, one of the owners of Good, which squashes hemp seeds into oil and milk.It seems unthinkable now, but as recently as 2008, alternatives to cow’s milk largely meant soya (invariably Alpro in the UK, Silk in the US). For anything else, you’d need to scour health-food shops for drab, clinical-looking, long-life cartons of rice milk buried in the back with the other digestive aids. “It was the deathly aisle,” said John Schoolcraft, Oatly’s global creative director. “It was just for people who were lactose intolerant [or] had an allergy to milk; vegans, vegetarians – people who, at that time, were on the fringe of society.”Plant milks are no longer fringe. Just over one in 10 of Pret a Manger’s hot drinks in the UK are ordered with dairy alternative milks (organic soya milk or organic rice-coconut milk). According to research firm Mintel, UK plant milk sales have grown by 30% since 2015, buoyed by a surge in vegan and vegetarian diets. In the US, nearly half of all shoppers now add a plant milk to their baskets. Globally, the industry is estimated to be worth $16bn.Meanwhile, reduced demand for cow’s milk and falling prices led to the closure of 1,000 dairy farms in the UK between 2013 and 2016. Milk’s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties about bovine antibiotics, animal cruelty and the industry’s environmental impact, as well as increased diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Teenagers now consider cow’s milk less healthy than plant milk alternatives, a development the former chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, called “a demographic time bomb”.“Consumers are really not sure about the dairy industry,” Caroline Roux, a dairy analyst at Mintel, told me. “They’re not convinced these products are good for them any more.”But the plant milk boom is, as one entrepreneur told me, “way bigger than just switching your milk”. To converts, almond and oat milk are the next wave in a fundamental shift towards a more conscious, sustainable way of living. To critics, they’re little more than cleverly marketed nut juice with additives – a symptom of everything that’s wrong with modern food culture. And so a strange battle has emerged, between an industry trying to replace something it says we don’t need in the first place, and dairy, a business that for a century sold itself as the foundation of a healthy diet, while ignoring the fact that most of the world does just fine without it.We are all born milk drinkers. Babies’ guts produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the sugar in breastmilk (and cow’s milk), into the simpler sugars glucose and galactose. But for the majority of humans, production of the enzyme lactase plummets after weaning. “From a human perspective – no, to go further than that, from a mammalian perspective – the norm is to be able to tolerate your mother’s breast milk, and then as you get past infancy, to stop producing lactase and become lactose intolerant,” said Adam Fox, a consultant paediatric allergist at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospitals, and one of the UK’s leading food allergy experts. “Then you’ve got a small group of humans that have a mutation which means they maintain production of lactase into adulthood. Northern Europeans, the Masai [in east Africa], some Arab groups as well. But that’s the exception, not the rule.”That schism between milk-drinkers and the rest – actually a series of independent genetic mutations – appears to have occurred about 10,000 years ago, around the time humans were domesticating farm animals. It is the reason that in countries such as the UK, Sweden and Ireland, more than 90% of adults can drink milk without suffering any ill effects, but worldwide, more than two-thirds of all adults are considered lactose intolerant. For lactose-intolerant people, a glass of milk can induce bloating, stomach pains and diarrhoea. (Lactose intolerance should not be – though often is – confused with cow’s milk allergy, an immune response to the proteins in cow’s milk that affects around 1% of UK adults.)Even in northern Europe, milk as we know it is a recent phenomenon. Fresh milk, left unrefrigerated, spoils quickly and can harbour a variety of deadly pathogens, including E Coli and tuberculosis. For most of history it was either consumed within moments of milking, or processed as cheese or yoghurt. Few drunk milk in its liquid form. “The Romans considered it a sign of barbarism,” said Mark Kurlansky, author of Milk! A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. “The only people who drank milk were people on farms, because they were the only ones who could get it fresh enough.” (Even then, cow’s milk was considered inferior to alternatives such as goat or donkey.) In the 19th century, “swill milk” – so called because cows were fed the filthy runoff from inner-city breweries, turning their milk blue – was linked with thousands of infant deaths. Only in the early 20th century, with the introduction of mandatory pasteurisation – in which milk is heated to kill off any bacteria before bottling – did milk become safe enough for most people to drink regularly.It was the first world war that ultimately aligned political forces behind the dairy business. In Britain, rationing meant food was limited, and child malnutrition was rife. The emerging field of nutritional science identified milk – with its high protein content and newly discovered “vital amines”, or vitamins – as a potential solution. Thanks to government price controls, milk was one thing not in short supply. Soon, “consumers everywhere witnessed a snowfall of propaganda documenting the miracles worked by milk”, writes Deborah Valenze in Milk: A Local and Global History. Milk became the original superfood: a boundless source of calcium, protein and vitamins. In 1946, Clement Attlee and Harry S Truman’s governments both passed measures to ensure milk was available free with school meals. Industry alliances like the UK’s Milk Marketing Board embarked on campaigns to enhance milk’s image. More recently, in the US, the Got Milk? campaign showed celebrities from Beyoncé to Kermit the Frog with milk moustaches. The message was clear: if you wanted your children to grow up big and strong, they needed to be drinking milk.Today, dairy is a vast and highly regulated behemoth, worth more than $400bn, produced by a global herd of more than 274 million cows. Politicians mess with milk at their peril (when Margaret Thatcher, as education secretary, in 1971 took the draconian step of cutting free school milk for the over-sevens, she was branded “milk snatcher”). And yet, for many consumers, the allure of milk is on the wane. In 1975, the average American consumed 247 pounds (around 130 litres) of milk per year; in 2017, it was just 149 pounds (66 litres). In the US, milk sales have fallen 15% since 2012.Milk’s “share of throat” – an industry term for the proportion of total liquid we consume in a day – has been eroded by a steady flow of soft drinks, juices and smoothies, even bottled water. But none of these presented an existential threat. Blanket marketing established the connection between milk and wholesomeness and good nutrition. Now new forms of persuasion, more targeted and pervasive, have stripped away that healthy sheen from dairy.The internet has given animal rights activists new reach. Search for “dairy” on YouTube and you will be assaulted by videos with titles like Dairy Is Scary (5m views), which depicts in graphic detail the suffering of dairy cows. Netflix, too, has provided previously untapped audiences for documentaries like Cowspiracy and What the Health. Besides the ill-treatment of animals, evidence has mounted that the dairy industry is catastrophic for the environment. Animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases than aviation, shipping and road vehicles combined. One recent study led by Oxford University claimed that observing a vegetarian or vegan diet is the single most effective way to reduce your own environmental footprint.Plant milks received a boost from their association with clean eating, a craze that has also had the effect of linking dairy with negative health issues. Clean eating, advocated by a fresh-skinned, glossy crop of wellness bloggers and Instagram celebrities, argued for the elimination of any foods deemed overly processed, allergenic, or otherwise “unnatural”: gluten, caffeine, meat and dairy. Its proponents blamed lactose intolerance as the cause of a range of ailments, including acne, eczema, lethargy, joint pain and a variety of digestive issues. And, as the clean eaters warned their readers off dairy, they sent them into the willing arms of plant milk startups. A steady supply of attractive millennial influencers filled their Instagram feeds with appetising shots of peanut-milk Thai curries and gluten-free beetroot bread. (According to industry analysts, one of the keys to the plant-based trend is that it looks appetising on Instagram.) The clean eaters did what years of vegan campaigning never could. Suddenly, giving up milk wasn’t just a health issue. It was part of living your best and most beautiful life.The notion of milking plants is not new. In China, soya milk has been made since at least the 14th century, most commonly as a step in making tofu. The earliest written mention of almond milk appears in a Baghdadi cookbook from 1226, the Kitab al-Tabikh. “If you look at Medieval recipes, they will often give you a choice between milk or almond milk,” said Mark Kurlansky (whose best-seller Cod: A Biography, launched an entire genre of food microhistories).In the west, until recently, almond and soya milk remained relatively unknown, except by vegetarians and the odd eccentric (Henry Ford, of the car company, was an early soya evangelist). In 1956, the Plantmilk Society was established in London by Leslie Cross, then vice-president of the British Vegan Society, a nascent group of animal rights activists. Cross, who particularly objected to the cruelty of the dairy industry, set about trying to find a dairy replacement using crops that could be grown in Britain.“The big issue originally was: how do you get a protein in a liquid that can emulate dairy milk?” said Adrian Ling, whose father, Arthur, was chair of the new organisation. Photos from the time show the smiling pioneers in white lab coats examining many glasses of questionable opaque liquids. “They did a lot of work on cabbage,” Ling said. Eventually, they settled on the soya bean. “It was a very small market – a few hundred people,” said Ling. “They lost a lot of money.”In 1981, a young Belgian food tech named Philippe Vandemoortele decided to use a new packing technology, the sterile Tetra Brik, to sell soya milk. “I started in a garage with pots and pans, a grinder. I was young, and very naive,” Vandemoortele, now 73, told me. He called his soya milk Alpro. Reviews were mixed. The local supermarket refused to stock it. “The buyer tasted my product, and he said: ‘Whoa. It’s awful!’” But Vandemoortele persisted. Today Alpro is owned by Danone, and in 2017 had a turnover in excess of £183m.Soya’s real break came in the late 90s, when a Colorado soya company called WhiteWave made what seems like a confoundingly obvious discovery: if they moved the product to the refrigerated aisle alongside the dairy milk, more people bought it. WhiteWave’s new refrigerated soya drink, which it called Silk, was a sensation. At the same time, Silk, Alpro and others jumped on emerging evidence about the link between high cholesterol and heart disease to market themselves as a healthy alternative. All of a sudden, soya was for everyone.Soya’s rapid growth was short-lived, in large part due to the fact that it doesn’t taste very good. Even modern soya milks, which add sugar, thickeners and other additives to imitate dairy milk, have a beany taste and odour. In the early 2000s, soya had its own health scare. Soya contains phytoestrogens, oestrogen-like compounds that can mimic the hormone’s effects in humans, a discovery that led to fears about it disrupting hormones and “feminising” men. Clinical studies have consistently shown those fears are overstated. Even so, neo-Nazis continue to push the theory that soya milk is a liberal conspiracy to emasculate men, and drink cow’s milk at rallies to demonstrate “digestive superiority”.In 2008, the Blue Diamond Growers, a large cooperative of almond farmers in California, sensed an opportunity. Its milk, Almond Breeze, had long lagged behind Silk, by then America’s leading soya brand. “We knew if we were wanting to compete with them, we would need to be in the refrigerated case,” Al Greenlee, Blue Diamond’s director of marketing, told me. Supermarkets maintain a tight grip on shelf space, charging high fees to stock a new product. Lucrative, high-traffic displays like the refrigerated case are fiercely competitive. The owners of Silk at that time – the dairy giant Dean Foods – had leveraged its industry clout to get Silk positioned alongside milk. “So we followed a similar path, and established a partnership with the second largest dairy in the country”. Blue Diamond started in Florida, targeting neighbourhoods with large Hispanic populations, who have a higher genetic incidence of lactose intolerance.Meanwhile, the California almond industry embarked on a vast marketing spree, funding – and publicising – new research into the health benefits of almonds. The effect was immediate. Glossy magazines proclaimed almonds a “superfood”. Almond Breeze was so successful that within two years Silk launched its own almond milk to try and keep up. By 2013, almond had overtaken soya as the best-selling plant milk in the US.In today’s crowded market, newcomers require something special to stand out. An Australian milk called Nutty Bruce boasts of “activated almonds”, which is a nod to the current craze for charcoal (superheated and then oxidised, “activated” charcoal is marketed as a detoxifier), but at closer inspection just means the almonds are soaked in water for slightly longer than usual. A San Francisco startup called Ripple claims to have developed a hi-tech process to isolate the protein in yellow peas without any of the associated flavours or colourings. Cheryl Mitchell, the chief scientist of the New York-based producer Elmhurst Milked, told me excitedly about her patented extraction process, which uses “high-pressure water and a sloughing action” to break down nuts and pulses while keeping the proteins intact.Mitchell comes from an esteemed line of food technologists: her father, Bill, invented Cool Whip imitation cream, the Pop Rocks popping candy and Tang fruit-flavoured drink. In the 1980s, she helped develop Rice Dream. Elmhurst was a dairy for 90 years; at its peak, it supplied public schools and Starbucks branches across Manhattan. But in 2016, its owners sold off the cattle and switched to plant milk. It now sells 11 varieties. “Wait till they see the corn milk,” she said. “It’s yellow, but it has more antioxidants than blueberries!”It seems every ingredient has its acolytes. “We are here to spread a philosophy about a way of being, one which is much more harmonious and symbiotic with nature,” Tamara Arbib, the founder of London-based coconut drinks company Rebel Kitchen, told me. Rebel Kitchen’s Mylk, launched in 2014, is a blend of coconut, rice and cashew. “I’m a massive fan of eating right for your blood type,” Arbib said. “A lot of blood types do better without dairy.”In July, I went to see one of the UK’s most prominent plant milk startups, Rude Health, in London. Launched by Camilla and Nick Barnard in 2005, Rude Health started out selling muesli, but quickly grew into a small health food empire. It was the tail end of a heatwave, at brunch time, and the Rude Health Cafe hummed with healthy looking professionals sipping cashew lattes. Nick, who has sharp features, grey hair, and wore an open-collared white shirt, ordered a kombucha. “I’m having dairy,” Camilla said, conspiratorially.Rude Health had attracted negative press in 2017, after some vegans became incensed at a company blogpost promoting sustainable dairy. “It hadn’t crossed our minds that to be for dairy free, we were expected to be against dairy,” Camilla said. “We were just chugging along, thinking we were for good quality.” The episode had made them reconsider their marketing strategy, to clarify that they’re not an exclusively vegan brand. “Why does everything have to be the magic pill, or the devil? Why do you have to be for or against?”Rude Health got into plant milks in 2013, selling three flavours: oat, brown rice and almond. Today, it sells 10, including Tiger Nut, Cashew and Hazelnut & Cacao. We walked over to the company’s offices nearby for a tasting session. Rival products and plant-based cookbooks lined the shelves. Nick poured shots of various shades of beige into small glasses. Many plant milk brands add calcium carbonate – chalk – to make the liquid whiter and more opaque (the calcium content is a happy bonus) but the colouring in these plant milks, Camilla assured me, was natural. We tried a few. The coconut was sweet, like a Bounty dissolved in water. The hazelnut was pleasingly thick, if slightly overwhelming. “Tondo Gentile,” Nick said, approvingly. “A gourmet hazelnut.”The almond tasted thin by comparison. The brand’s regular Almond Drink contains brown rice, “cold-pressed” sunflower oil and sea salt, but Rude Health also offers Ultimate Almond – just nuts and water – intended for purists. “There is a hardcore market,” Camilla said.Today, almond makes up around two thirds of all plant milks sold, but it is suffering its own reputational crisis. One issue is environmental: it takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond (technically not a nut, but a seed). In California, which grows eight in 10 of the world’s almond crop, almond growing consumes an estimated 10% of the entire water supply – a controversial issue in a state often afflicted by drought.Consumers have also caught on that the actual almond content of most almond milks is minuscule. Both Silk and Alpro contain just 2% almonds. “It’s actually a water-based emulsion that you’re adding oils, a lot of sugar and gums to, and then just adding a couple of nuts on top,” Elmhurst’s Cheryl Mitchell said. “As a business model, it’s great – any time you can sell water, right? That’s essentially what they’re doing.” The industry insiders I spoke to agreed that almond’s moment is over. Right now the real growth is in coconut, and in oat.In 2012, when Petersson took over as CEO of Oatly, almost nobody had heard of oat milk outside Sweden. The company was founded in 1994 by Rickard Öste, a researcher at the university of Lund. “It’s a really good crop. You can grow oats everywhere,” said Petersson. “It has carbs, it has fat, it has protein and it has fibre.” Compared to oat milk, he said, almond is just “flavoured plant juice”.Petersson, who is 50, with dark hair and slim features, set about reinventing oat milk’s image. He hired John Schoolcraft, a marketing and advertising executive who had been running his own company, to help him. The concept, Schoolcraft said, was simple: “If you’re not lactose intolerant, why would you notice our product?” The pair redesigned its packaging, ditching its previous generic, 1990s aesthetic for a brash, millennial-friendly redesign: Oatly was restyled as Oat-ly! and the side of each carton displayed one of more than 80 messages written by Oatly staff, which congratulated readers on being part of the “post-milk generation” and, only semi-ironically, joining “the cult”.Oatly’s real masterstroke was the creation of its Barista Edition. Most plant milks split in hot drinks – one reason that so many manufacturers use acidity regulators and other additives – and don’t foam like cow’s milk (the problem is the plant proteins). There, Oatly has an advantage: it foams, and the taste of oat is mostly masked by the coffee. Petersson and Schoolcraft ignored supermarkets and targeted coffee bars in the hip neighbourhoods of Brooklyn in New York and Shoreditch in London. “The volume comes from retail, but the demand is created in coffee shops,” Petersson explained. “That’s where you try our product and experience oat for the first time, in an environment that you like.”“It blew my hair back,” said Stuart Forsyth, a former barista and the co-founder of vegan coffee brand Minor Figures. “Oatly made oats sexy.”Oatly’s growth hasn’t been without controversy. In 2015, the Swedish milk industry sued it, claiming its ad slogan “Like milk, but made for humans” unfairly denigrated cow’s milk. Oatly lost, but Petersson and Schoolcraft continue to use the slogan outside Sweden. “The line implies what everyone already knows. Milk is produced by cows for the benefit of baby cows,” said Schoolcraft.Whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow’s milk is a matter of fierce debate, and not an inconsequential one. In June 2017, a Belgian couple were convicted of unintentionally causing the death of their seven-month-old baby, after feeding him oat and quinoa milks instead of infant formula. The parents, who ran a health-food shop, believed the child was lactose intolerant and sought the advice of homeopaths rather than seeking medical attention.Much of the debate revolves around whether or not plant milks should be fortified with additional vitamins to better imitate cow’s milk. Oatly fortifies its product according to WHO guidelines. Rude Health doesn’t. “The minute you start fortifying, you’re pretending it’s milk,” Camilla Barnard told me. “I don’t want to do that. It feels dishonest.” Because the Soil Association refuses organic certification to fortified products, many new plant milks choose the “purity” (and associated high price) of organic over the use of additional nutrients. Califia Farms’ unsweetened almond milk boasts “50% more calcium than milk” on its bottle – but it doesn’t contain Vitamin D, B12, Riboflavin or any of the other nutrients found in milk or other fortified plant milks.“A consumer has to read the label and understand the variation that exists in these milks, because they range tremendously,” said Dennis Savaiano, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University who has studied milk for more than 30 years.What most plant milks are desperate to tell you is what they don’t have in them. Dairy-free; sugar-free; soya-free; gluten-free; GMO-free; bisphenol A-free – in some cases, the “free from” declarations are actually longer than the ingredients list. Califia Farms boasts its products are carrageenan-free, despite the widely used stabiliser being approved as safe by the European commission, the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. It’s the inevitable culmination of today’s anxious eating culture: we’ve gone from buying foods on the merits of their ingredients, to buying them on the basis of what’s left out.“If you look at our category, it’s a little bit messed up, you know?” Petersson conceded. “What’s the definition of an oat milk? Think of the comparison between oat milk and soya milk and almond or rice – are those all plant-based milks, or not? Nobody really knows.”To protect against such uncertainty – and protect the dairy industry from the upstarts – a US senator from Wisconsin sponsored a bill in 2017 called the Dairy Pride (Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk and Cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday) Act, which would ban plant drinks from impersonating dairy.“No one is necessarily drinking milk for the nutritional benefits of it,” said Tamara Arbib of Rebel Kitchen. “When you’re an adult, you’re having it because you want something creamy in your drinks.” It is true that our postwar worries about child malnutrition have been replaced with fears about childhood obesity. And the two-thirds of the world that can’t drink milk aren’t suffering from osteoporosis or rickets; in fact, China and Japan have lower rates of these conditions than Europe.“A lot of scientists think this thing about how children have to drink cow’s milk is bogus. This idea that it makes you big and strong is clearly bogus,” Mark Kurlansky, the food historian, told me. “On the other hand, this idea that ‘milk is bad for you so I’m going to have almond milk or soya milk or something’ – that’s bogus, too. Because it’s a totally different food.”Every nutritionist I spoke to emphasised that milk is no less healthy than it’s ever been; in fact, it’s never been safer. “From a scientific perspective, the data that suggests milk is a bad food just doesn’t exist,” said Savaiano. “It has a lot of nutrients in it. It’s a great source of calcium, it’s a great source of protein, it’s a good source of riboflavin and potassium. So you can’t make the argument it’s not a nutritious food.” Nor could any health professional I spoke to point to any data showing a confirmed rise in diagnosed lactose intolerance, though most agreed that cases of self-diagnosis are rising.But the plant milk boom is not really about nutrition. Nor is it the first wave of a shift towards ethical, plant-based living – much as we need it. “Those other things might be on people’s lists, but they’re secondary selling characteristics,” explained Julian Mellentin, director of New Nutrition Business, a food industry analyst firm that has tracked plant milk’s rise. He pointed out that 90% of plant milk buyers still purchase other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, both of which are still growing. The forces driving us towards plant milk are really something bigger: a manifestation of a collective anxiety that something is wrong with our bodies. That we aren’t as healthy and happy as we could be – or perhaps, should be – and something, or someone, must be to blame.“There’s a lot of people discovering dairy intolerances and gluten intolerances and that kind of stuff, but actually I think what you’re looking at is much more intolerance to the life we’ve been living,” said Arbib.Our growing suspicion of milk is perhaps a symptom of a lost faith: in Big Agriculture, in nutritional science. “People have learned that dietary advice changes,” Mellentin said. First saturated fat was killing us, now sugar is the number one enemy. Eggs and nuts were sources of bad cholesterol, now they’re superfoods. “So, understandably, people have become sceptical,” Mellentin went on. “Why listen to an expert when they change their mind all the time?” It doesn’t matter that that is how science works. Science changes, so who’s to say that your blood type doesn’t affect your dairy tolerance, or that carrageenan wasn’t the reason for some unspecified malaise? Just because our newfound lactose anxiety isn’t necessarily medically diagnosable, Mellentin said, that doesn’t mean it should be written off. “It’s not to do with allergies. It’s to do with how people feel, and making themselves feel better,” he said. How can you argue with that?Recently, Oatly has begun eyeing plant milk’s next target: China. It launched in the country in 2016, after receiving an undisclosed investment from a Chinese conglomerate. Sales have been promising. Demand for milk in China is growing, and Chinese businesses are investing heavily in plant milk and lactose-free alternatives. To Oatly, conquering China is more than business, it’s an ethical obligation. “The worst thing that could happen [environmentally] is if the Chinese people started to drink dairy milk, because there wouldn’t be enough cows in the world to support that,” said Toni Petersson, the CEO. The company’s latest challenge is competition: Quaker has announced plans for a line of oat drinks, and in January Silk launched its own oat brand, Oat Yeah. “We think oats can become its own category,” Petersson said.Other plant milk entrepreneurs were more cautious. Everyone knows how quickly health-food hype – juice cleanses, coconut oil – can die off. Meanwhile, kombucha is gaining ground as the gut-friendly food cure of the moment. Mellentin was blunt: “Peak plant milk is about three to five years away, at most.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.• This article was amended on 29 January 2019.

White gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks | Food | The Guardian How wellness upstarts spoiled milk’s healthy reputation – and built a billion-dollar industry from juicing oats and nuts. By Oliver Franklin-Wallis In the spring of 2018, New York was gripped by a sudden, very particular and, for some, calamitous food shortage. Gaps appeared on grocery shelves. Coffee shops put out signs, turning customers away. Twitter and Instagram brimmed with outrage. The truly desperate searched from Williamsburg to Harlem, but it seemed undeniable: New York was out of oat milk.It wasn’t just New York, in fact. The entire US was suffering from a shortage of Oatly, a Swedish plant milk whose rapid rise from obscure digestive health brand to the dairy alternative of choice had caught even Oatly by surprise. Since its US launch in 2016, Oatly had gone from supplying a handful of upscale New York coffee shops to more than 3,000 cafes and grocery stores nationwide. The company had ramped up production by 1,250%, but when I spoke to CEO Toni Petersson in late summer, they were still struggling to meet demand. “How do we supply when the growth is this crazy?” Petersson said.Fortunately, when it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternative alternatives. Visit your local supermarket and you will find a refrigerated aisle overflowing with choice: almond milk, hazelnut milk, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew – and that’s just the nuts. Coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea – you name it, somewhere a health-food startup is milking it. London tube stations are filled with ads for new plant milks – or rather, “mylks” (EU law prevents dairy alternatives from using the word milk if it isn’t produced by a lactating mammal). Cookbooks dedicate entire chapters to blending and straining your own. Sainsbury’s now stocks around 70 different options. There are the wellness punks (Rebel Kitchen, Rude Health), the dairy puns (Malk, Milkadamia, Mooala) and the nourishers (LoveRaw, Good Karma, Plenish). “People are just looking at every nut that exists and seeing if they can squash it into a milk,” said Glynis Murray, one of the owners of Good, which squashes hemp seeds into oil and milk.It seems unthinkable now, but as recently as 2008, alternatives to cow’s milk largely meant soya (invariably Alpro in the UK, Silk in the US). For anything else, you’d need to scour health-food shops for drab, clinical-looking, long-life cartons of rice milk buried in the back with the other digestive aids. “It was the deathly aisle,” said John Schoolcraft, Oatly’s global creative director. “It was just for people who were lactose intolerant [or] had an allergy to milk; vegans, vegetarians – people who, at that time, were on the fringe of society.”Plant milks are no longer fringe. Just over one in 10 of Pret a Manger’s hot drinks in the UK are ordered with dairy alternative milks (organic soya milk or organic rice-coconut milk). According to research firm Mintel, UK plant milk sales have grown by 30% since 2015, buoyed by a surge in vegan and vegetarian diets. In the US, nearly half of all shoppers now add a plant milk to their baskets. Globally, the industry is estimated to be worth $16bn.Meanwhile, reduced demand for cow’s milk and falling prices led to the closure of 1,000 dairy farms in the UK between 2013 and 2016. Milk’s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties about bovine antibiotics, animal cruelty and the industry’s environmental impact, as well as increased diagnosis of lactose intolerance. Teenagers now consider cow’s milk less healthy than plant milk alternatives, a development the former chairman of Dairy UK, David Dobbin, called “a demographic time bomb”.“Consumers are really not sure about the dairy industry,” Caroline Roux, a dairy analyst at Mintel, told me. “They’re not convinced these products are good for them any more.”But the plant milk boom is, as one entrepreneur told me, “way bigger than just switching your milk”. To converts, almond and oat milk are the next wave in a fundamental shift towards a more conscious, sustainable way of living. To critics, they’re little more than cleverly marketed nut juice with additives – a symptom of everything that’s wrong with modern food culture. And so a strange battle has emerged, between an industry trying to replace something it says we don’t need in the first place, and dairy, a business that for a century sold itself as the foundation of a healthy diet, while ignoring the fact that most of the world does just fine without it.We are all born milk drinkers. Babies’ guts produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose, the sugar in breastmilk (and cow’s milk), into the simpler sugars glucose and galactose. But for the majority of humans, production of the enzyme lactase plummets after weaning. “From a human perspective – no, to go further than that, from a mammalian perspective – the norm is to be able to tolerate your mother’s breast milk, and then as you get past infancy, to stop producing lactase and become lactose intolerant,” said Adam Fox, a consultant paediatric allergist at Guy’s and St Thomas’s hospitals, and one of the UK’s leading food allergy experts. “Then you’ve got a small group of humans that have a mutation which means they maintain production of lactase into adulthood. Northern Europeans, the Masai [in east Africa], some Arab groups as well. But that’s the exception, not the rule.”That schism between milk-drinkers and the rest – actually a series of independent genetic mutations – appears to have occurred about 10,000 years ago, around the time humans were domesticating farm animals. It is the reason that in countries such as the UK, Sweden and Ireland, more than 90% of adults can drink milk without suffering any ill effects, but worldwide, more than two-thirds of all adults are considered lactose intolerant. For lactose-intolerant people, a glass of milk can induce bloating, stomach pains and diarrhoea. (Lactose intolerance should not be – though often is – confused with cow’s milk allergy, an immune response to the proteins in cow’s milk that affects around 1% of UK adults.)Even in northern Europe, milk as we know it is a recent phenomenon. Fresh milk, left unrefrigerated, spoils quickly and can harbour a variety of deadly pathogens, including E Coli and tuberculosis. For most of history it was either consumed within moments of milking, or processed as cheese or yoghurt. Few drunk milk in its liquid form. “The Romans considered it a sign of barbarism,” said Mark Kurlansky, author of Milk! A 10,000-Year Food Fracas. “The only people who drank milk were people on farms, because they were the only ones who could get it fresh enough.” (Even then, cow’s milk was considered inferior to alternatives such as goat or donkey.) In the 19th century, “swill milk” – so called because cows were fed the filthy runoff from inner-city breweries, turning their milk blue – was linked with thousands of infant deaths. Only in the early 20th century, with the introduction of mandatory pasteurisation – in which milk is heated to kill off any bacteria before bottling – did milk become safe enough for most people to drink regularly.It was the first world war that ultimately aligned political forces behind the dairy business. In Britain, rationing meant food was limited, and child malnutrition was rife. The emerging field of nutritional science identified milk – with its high protein content and newly discovered “vital amines”, or vitamins – as a potential solution. Thanks to government price controls, milk was one thing not in short supply. Soon, “consumers everywhere witnessed a snowfall of propaganda documenting the miracles worked by milk”, writes Deborah Valenze in Milk: A Local and Global History. Milk became the original superfood: a boundless source of calcium, protein and vitamins. In 1946, Clement Attlee and Harry S Truman’s governments both passed measures to ensure milk was available free with school meals. Industry alliances like the UK’s Milk Marketing Board embarked on campaigns to enhance milk’s image. More recently, in the US, the Got Milk? campaign showed celebrities from Beyoncé to Kermit the Frog with milk moustaches. The message was clear: if you wanted your children to grow up big and strong, they needed to be drinking milk.Today, dairy is a vast and highly regulated behemoth, worth more than $400bn, produced by a global herd of more than 274 million cows. Politicians mess with milk at their peril (when Margaret Thatcher, as education secretary, in 1971 took the draconian step of cutting free school milk for the over-sevens, she was branded “milk snatcher”). And yet, for many consumers, the allure of milk is on the wane. In 1975, the average American consumed 247 pounds (around 130 litres) of milk per year; in 2017, it was just 149 pounds (66 litres). In the US, milk sales have fallen 15% since 2012.Milk’s “share of throat” – an industry term for the proportion of total liquid we consume in a day – has been eroded by a steady flow of soft drinks, juices and smoothies, even bottled water. But none of these presented an existential threat. Blanket marketing established the connection between milk and wholesomeness and good nutrition. Now new forms of persuasion, more targeted and pervasive, have stripped away that healthy sheen from dairy.The internet has given animal rights activists new reach. Search for “dairy” on YouTube and you will be assaulted by videos with titles like Dairy Is Scary (5m views), which depicts in graphic detail the suffering of dairy cows. Netflix, too, has provided previously untapped audiences for documentaries like Cowspiracy and What the Health. Besides the ill-treatment of animals, evidence has mounted that the dairy industry is catastrophic for the environment. Animal agriculture contributes more greenhouse gases than aviation, shipping and road vehicles combined. One recent study led by Oxford University claimed that observing a vegetarian or vegan diet is the single most effective way to reduce your own environmental footprint.Plant milks received a boost from their association with clean eating, a craze that has also had the effect of linking dairy with negative health issues. Clean eating, advocated by a fresh-skinned, glossy crop of wellness bloggers and Instagram celebrities, argued for the elimination of any foods deemed overly processed, allergenic, or otherwise “unnatural”: gluten, caffeine, meat and dairy. Its proponents blamed lactose intolerance as the cause of a range of ailments, including acne, eczema, lethargy, joint pain and a variety of digestive issues. And, as the clean eaters warned their readers off dairy, they sent them into the willing arms of plant milk startups. A steady supply of attractive millennial influencers filled their Instagram feeds with appetising shots of peanut-milk Thai curries and gluten-free beetroot bread. (According to industry analysts, one of the keys to the plant-based trend is that it looks appetising on Instagram.) The clean eaters did what years of vegan campaigning never could. Suddenly, giving up milk wasn’t just a health issue. It was part of living your best and most beautiful life.The notion of milking plants is not new. In China, soya milk has been made since at least the 14th century, most commonly as a step in making tofu. The earliest written mention of almond milk appears in a Baghdadi cookbook from 1226, the Kitab al-Tabikh. “If you look at Medieval recipes, they will often give you a choice between milk or almond milk,” said Mark Kurlansky (whose best-seller Cod: A Biography, launched an entire genre of food microhistories).In the west, until recently, almond and soya milk remained relatively unknown, except by vegetarians and the odd eccentric (Henry Ford, of the car company, was an early soya evangelist). In 1956, the Plantmilk Society was established in London by Leslie Cross, then vice-president of the British Vegan Society, a nascent group of animal rights activists. Cross, who particularly objected to the cruelty of the dairy industry, set about trying to find a dairy replacement using crops that could be grown in Britain.“The big issue originally was: how do you get a protein in a liquid that can emulate dairy milk?” said Adrian Ling, whose father, Arthur, was chair of the new organisation. Photos from the time show the smiling pioneers in white lab coats examining many glasses of questionable opaque liquids. “They did a lot of work on cabbage,” Ling said. Eventually, they settled on the soya bean. “It was a very small market – a few hundred people,” said Ling. “They lost a lot of money.”In 1981, a young Belgian food tech named Philippe Vandemoortele decided to use a new packing technology, the sterile Tetra Brik, to sell soya milk. “I started in a garage with pots and pans, a grinder. I was young, and very naive,” Vandemoortele, now 73, told me. He called his soya milk Alpro. Reviews were mixed. The local supermarket refused to stock it. “The buyer tasted my product, and he said: ‘Whoa. It’s awful!’” But Vandemoortele persisted. Today Alpro is owned by Danone, and in 2017 had a turnover in excess of £183m.Soya’s real break came in the late 90s, when a Colorado soya company called WhiteWave made what seems like a confoundingly obvious discovery: if they moved the product to the refrigerated aisle alongside the dairy milk, more people bought it. WhiteWave’s new refrigerated soya drink, which it called Silk, was a sensation. At the same time, Silk, Alpro and others jumped on emerging evidence about the link between high cholesterol and heart disease to market themselves as a healthy alternative. All of a sudden, soya was for everyone.Soya’s rapid growth was short-lived, in large part due to the fact that it doesn’t taste very good. Even modern soya milks, which add sugar, thickeners and other additives to imitate dairy milk, have a beany taste and odour. In the early 2000s, soya had its own health scare. Soya contains phytoestrogens, oestrogen-like compounds that can mimic the hormone’s effects in humans, a discovery that led to fears about it disrupting hormones and “feminising” men. Clinical studies have consistently shown those fears are overstated. Even so, neo-Nazis continue to push the theory that soya milk is a liberal conspiracy to emasculate men, and drink cow’s milk at rallies to demonstrate “digestive superiority”.In 2008, the Blue Diamond Growers, a large cooperative of almond farmers in California, sensed an opportunity. Its milk, Almond Breeze, had long lagged behind Silk, by then America’s leading soya brand. “We knew if we were wanting to compete with them, we would need to be in the refrigerated case,” Al Greenlee, Blue Diamond’s director of marketing, told me. Supermarkets maintain a tight grip on shelf space, charging high fees to stock a new product. Lucrative, high-traffic displays like the refrigerated case are fiercely competitive. The owners of Silk at that time – the dairy giant Dean Foods – had leveraged its industry clout to get Silk positioned alongside milk. “So we followed a similar path, and established a partnership with the second largest dairy in the country”. Blue Diamond started in Florida, targeting neighbourhoods with large Hispanic populations, who have a higher genetic incidence of lactose intolerance.Meanwhile, the California almond industry embarked on a vast marketing spree, funding – and publicising – new research into the health benefits of almonds. The effect was immediate. Glossy magazines proclaimed almonds a “superfood”. Almond Breeze was so successful that within two years Silk launched its own almond milk to try and keep up. By 2013, almond had overtaken soya as the best-selling plant milk in the US.In today’s crowded market, newcomers require something special to stand out. An Australian milk called Nutty Bruce boasts of “activated almonds”, which is a nod to the current craze for charcoal (superheated and then oxidised, “activated” charcoal is marketed as a detoxifier), but at closer inspection just means the almonds are soaked in water for slightly longer than usual. A San Francisco startup called Ripple claims to have developed a hi-tech process to isolate the protein in yellow peas without any of the associated flavours or colourings. Cheryl Mitchell, the chief scientist of the New York-based producer Elmhurst Milked, told me excitedly about her patented extraction process, which uses “high-pressure water and a sloughing action” to break down nuts and pulses while keeping the proteins intact.Mitchell comes from an esteemed line of food technologists: her father, Bill, invented Cool Whip imitation cream, the Pop Rocks popping candy and Tang fruit-flavoured drink. In the 1980s, she helped develop Rice Dream. Elmhurst was a dairy for 90 years; at its peak, it supplied public schools and Starbucks branches across Manhattan. But in 2016, its owners sold off the cattle and switched to plant milk. It now sells 11 varieties. “Wait till they see the corn milk,” she said. “It’s yellow, but it has more antioxidants than blueberries!”It seems every ingredient has its acolytes. “We are here to spread a philosophy about a way of being, one which is much more harmonious and symbiotic with nature,” Tamara Arbib, the founder of London-based coconut drinks company Rebel Kitchen, told me. Rebel Kitchen’s Mylk, launched in 2014, is a blend of coconut, rice and cashew. “I’m a massive fan of eating right for your blood type,” Arbib said. “A lot of blood types do better without dairy.”In July, I went to see one of the UK’s most prominent plant milk startups, Rude Health, in London. Launched by Camilla and Nick Barnard in 2005, Rude Health started out selling muesli, but quickly grew into a small health food empire. It was the tail end of a heatwave, at brunch time, and the Rude Health Cafe hummed with healthy looking professionals sipping cashew lattes. Nick, who has sharp features, grey hair, and wore an open-collared white shirt, ordered a kombucha. “I’m having dairy,” Camilla said, conspiratorially.Rude Health had attracted negative press in 2017, after some vegans became incensed at a company blogpost promoting sustainable dairy. “It hadn’t crossed our minds that to be for dairy free, we were expected to be against dairy,” Camilla said. “We were just chugging along, thinking we were for good quality.” The episode had made them reconsider their marketing strategy, to clarify that they’re not an exclusively vegan brand. “Why does everything have to be the magic pill, or the devil? Why do you have to be for or against?”Rude Health got into plant milks in 2013, selling three flavours: oat, brown rice and almond. Today, it sells 10, including Tiger Nut, Cashew and Hazelnut & Cacao. We walked over to the company’s offices nearby for a tasting session. Rival products and plant-based cookbooks lined the shelves. Nick poured shots of various shades of beige into small glasses. Many plant milk brands add calcium carbonate – chalk – to make the liquid whiter and more opaque (the calcium content is a happy bonus) but the colouring in these plant milks, Camilla assured me, was natural. We tried a few. The coconut was sweet, like a Bounty dissolved in water. The hazelnut was pleasingly thick, if slightly overwhelming. “Tondo Gentile,” Nick said, approvingly. “A gourmet hazelnut.”The almond tasted thin by comparison. The brand’s regular Almond Drink contains brown rice, “cold-pressed” sunflower oil and sea salt, but Rude Health also offers Ultimate Almond – just nuts and water – intended for purists. “There is a hardcore market,” Camilla said.Today, almond makes up around two thirds of all plant milks sold, but it is suffering its own reputational crisis. One issue is environmental: it takes 4.5 litres of water to grow a single almond (technically not a nut, but a seed). In California, which grows eight in 10 of the world’s almond crop, almond growing consumes an estimated 10% of the entire water supply – a controversial issue in a state often afflicted by drought.Consumers have also caught on that the actual almond content of most almond milks is minuscule. Both Silk and Alpro contain just 2% almonds. “It’s actually a water-based emulsion that you’re adding oils, a lot of sugar and gums to, and then just adding a couple of nuts on top,” Elmhurst’s Cheryl Mitchell said. “As a business model, it’s great – any time you can sell water, right? That’s essentially what they’re doing.” The industry insiders I spoke to agreed that almond’s moment is over. Right now the real growth is in coconut, and in oat.In 2012, when Petersson took over as CEO of Oatly, almost nobody had heard of oat milk outside Sweden. The company was founded in 1994 by Rickard Öste, a researcher at the university of Lund. “It’s a really good crop. You can grow oats everywhere,” said Petersson. “It has carbs, it has fat, it has protein and it has fibre.” Compared to oat milk, he said, almond is just “flavoured plant juice”.Petersson, who is 50, with dark hair and slim features, set about reinventing oat milk’s image. He hired John Schoolcraft, a marketing and advertising executive who had been running his own company, to help him. The concept, Schoolcraft said, was simple: “If you’re not lactose intolerant, why would you notice our product?” The pair redesigned its packaging, ditching its previous generic, 1990s aesthetic for a brash, millennial-friendly redesign: Oatly was restyled as Oat-ly! and the side of each carton displayed one of more than 80 messages written by Oatly staff, which congratulated readers on being part of the “post-milk generation” and, only semi-ironically, joining “the cult”.Oatly’s real masterstroke was the creation of its Barista Edition. Most plant milks split in hot drinks – one reason that so many manufacturers use acidity regulators and other additives – and don’t foam like cow’s milk (the problem is the plant proteins). There, Oatly has an advantage: it foams, and the taste of oat is mostly masked by the coffee. Petersson and Schoolcraft ignored supermarkets and targeted coffee bars in the hip neighbourhoods of Brooklyn in New York and Shoreditch in London. “The volume comes from retail, but the demand is created in coffee shops,” Petersson explained. “That’s where you try our product and experience oat for the first time, in an environment that you like.”“It blew my hair back,” said Stuart Forsyth, a former barista and the co-founder of vegan coffee brand Minor Figures. “Oatly made oats sexy.”Oatly’s growth hasn’t been without controversy. In 2015, the Swedish milk industry sued it, claiming its ad slogan “Like milk, but made for humans” unfairly denigrated cow’s milk. Oatly lost, but Petersson and Schoolcraft continue to use the slogan outside Sweden. “The line implies what everyone already knows. Milk is produced by cows for the benefit of baby cows,” said Schoolcraft.Whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow’s milk is a matter of fierce debate, and not an inconsequential one. In June 2017, a Belgian couple were convicted of unintentionally causing the death of their seven-month-old baby, after feeding him oat and quinoa milks instead of infant formula. The parents, who ran a health-food shop, believed the child was lactose intolerant and sought the advice of homeopaths rather than seeking medical attention.Much of the debate revolves around whether or not plant milks should be fortified with additional vitamins to better imitate cow’s milk. Oatly fortifies its product according to WHO guidelines. Rude Health doesn’t. “The minute you start fortifying, you’re pretending it’s milk,” Camilla Barnard told me. “I don’t want to do that. It feels dishonest.” Because the Soil Association refuses organic certification to fortified products, many new plant milks choose the “purity” (and associated high price) of organic over the use of additional nutrients. Califia Farms’ unsweetened almond milk boasts “50% more calcium than milk” on its bottle – but it doesn’t contain Vitamin D, B12, Riboflavin or any of the other nutrients found in milk or other fortified plant milks.“A consumer has to read the label and understand the variation that exists in these milks, because they range tremendously,” said Dennis Savaiano, a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University who has studied milk for more than 30 years.What most plant milks are desperate to tell you is what they don’t have in them. Dairy-free; sugar-free; soya-free; gluten-free; GMO-free; bisphenol A-free – in some cases, the “free from” declarations are actually longer than the ingredients list. Califia Farms boasts its products are carrageenan-free, despite the widely used stabiliser being approved as safe by the European commission, the US Food and Drug Administration and the WHO. It’s the inevitable culmination of today’s anxious eating culture: we’ve gone from buying foods on the merits of their ingredients, to buying them on the basis of what’s left out.“If you look at our category, it’s a little bit messed up, you know?” Petersson conceded. “What’s the definition of an oat milk? Think of the comparison between oat milk and soya milk and almond or rice – are those all plant-based milks, or not? Nobody really knows.”To protect against such uncertainty – and protect the dairy industry from the upstarts – a US senator from Wisconsin sponsored a bill in 2017 called the Dairy Pride (Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, Milk and Cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday) Act, which would ban plant drinks from impersonating dairy.“No one is necessarily drinking milk for the nutritional benefits of it,” said Tamara Arbib of Rebel Kitchen. “When you’re an adult, you’re having it because you want something creamy in your drinks.” It is true that our postwar worries about child malnutrition have been replaced with fears about childhood obesity. And the two-thirds of the world that can’t drink milk aren’t suffering from osteoporosis or rickets; in fact, China and Japan have lower rates of these conditions than Europe.“A lot of scientists think this thing about how children have to drink cow’s milk is bogus. This idea that it makes you big and strong is clearly bogus,” Mark Kurlansky, the food historian, told me. “On the other hand, this idea that ‘milk is bad for you so I’m going to have almond milk or soya milk or something’ – that’s bogus, too. Because it’s a totally different food.”Every nutritionist I spoke to emphasised that milk is no less healthy than it’s ever been; in fact, it’s never been safer. “From a scientific perspective, the data that suggests milk is a bad food just doesn’t exist,” said Savaiano. “It has a lot of nutrients in it. It’s a great source of calcium, it’s a great source of protein, it’s a good source of riboflavin and potassium. So you can’t make the argument it’s not a nutritious food.” Nor could any health professional I spoke to point to any data showing a confirmed rise in diagnosed lactose intolerance, though most agreed that cases of self-diagnosis are rising.But the plant milk boom is not really about nutrition. Nor is it the first wave of a shift towards ethical, plant-based living – much as we need it. “Those other things might be on people’s lists, but they’re secondary selling characteristics,” explained Julian Mellentin, director of New Nutrition Business, a food industry analyst firm that has tracked plant milk’s rise. He pointed out that 90% of plant milk buyers still purchase other dairy products, like cheese and ice cream, both of which are still growing. The forces driving us towards plant milk are really something bigger: a manifestation of a collective anxiety that something is wrong with our bodies. That we aren’t as healthy and happy as we could be – or perhaps, should be – and something, or someone, must be to blame.“There’s a lot of people discovering dairy intolerances and gluten intolerances and that kind of stuff, but actually I think what you’re looking at is much more intolerance to the life we’ve been living,” said Arbib.Our growing suspicion of milk is perhaps a symptom of a lost faith: in Big Agriculture, in nutritional science. “People have learned that dietary advice changes,” Mellentin said. First saturated fat was killing us, now sugar is the number one enemy. Eggs and nuts were sources of bad cholesterol, now they’re superfoods. “So, understandably, people have become sceptical,” Mellentin went on. “Why listen to an expert when they change their mind all the time?” It doesn’t matter that that is how science works. Science changes, so who’s to say that your blood type doesn’t affect your dairy tolerance, or that carrageenan wasn’t the reason for some unspecified malaise? Just because our newfound lactose anxiety isn’t necessarily medically diagnosable, Mellentin said, that doesn’t mean it should be written off. “It’s not to do with allergies. It’s to do with how people feel, and making themselves feel better,” he said. How can you argue with that?Recently, Oatly has begun eyeing plant milk’s next target: China. It launched in the country in 2016, after receiving an undisclosed investment from a Chinese conglomerate. Sales have been promising. Demand for milk in China is growing, and Chinese businesses are investing heavily in plant milk and lactose-free alternatives. To Oatly, conquering China is more than business, it’s an ethical obligation. “The worst thing that could happen [environmentally] is if the Chinese people started to drink dairy milk, because there wouldn’t be enough cows in the world to support that,” said Toni Petersson, the CEO. The company’s latest challenge is competition: Quaker has announced plans for a line of oat drinks, and in January Silk launched its own oat brand, Oat Yeah. “We think oats can become its own category,” Petersson said.Other plant milk entrepreneurs were more cautious. Everyone knows how quickly health-food hype – juice cleanses, coconut oil – can die off. Meanwhile, kombucha is gaining ground as the gut-friendly food cure of the moment. Mellentin was blunt: “Peak plant milk is about three to five years away, at most.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.• This article was amended on 29 January 2019.

26,Animal Testing,Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?,1s26q3r,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130609-will-we-ever-end-animal-testing,BBC - Future - Will we ever… eliminate animal experimentation?,"Arguably one of the most heated debates in science, efforts to reduce the number of animals used in studies face many barriers, says Alla Katsnelson.One of the most, if not the most, contentious issues in science is the use of animals in research. Scientists experiment on animals for a host of different reasons, including basic research to explore how organisms function, investigating potential treatments for human disease, and safety and quality control testing of drugs, devices and other products. Its proponents point to the long list of medical advances made possible with the help of animal research. Opponents believe it is cruel and meaningless, as observations in animals often do not translate directly to humans.In 1959, William Russell and Rex Burch proposed their “3Rs” guidelines for making the use of animals in scientific research more humane: restrict the use of animals; refine experiments to minimise distress; and replace tests with alternative techniques. Over the course of five decades their guidelines have become widely accepted worldwide, and while the reliability of published reports on the numbers used varies, they do at least provide a snapshot of historical trends. Around 29 million animals per year are currently used in experiments in the US and European Union countries. (Rats and mice make up around 80% of the total.) This is less than half the total in the mid-1970s – a significant drop, but one that has plateaued in the last decade.“In the late 1980s, people thought animal research was singing its swan song,” says Larry Carbone, a senior veterinarian at the University of California in San Francisco. Fresh out of veterinary school in 1987, Carbone landed a job as an animal vet at Cornell University, in New York State. At that time the numbers of animals being used in experiments and testing was on the decline: the campus was building a new multi-storey biotechnology facility, with just three rooms containing animal breeding and living facilities.But then came the development of tools that could selectively modify individual genes in mice. This proved to be such a powerful and popular technique that the decreasing trend in animal use ground to a halt.Now, a raft of novel experimental techniques may help to push numbers down again. Improvements in imaging methods that offer a peek inside the bodies of animals allow scientists to get more and better data from each experiment than before. For example, researchers previously had to cull multiple mice at different stages of tumour development, but now they can non-invasively watch the disease unfold in a single living animal using a fluorescent dye. Similarly, as brain-imaging techniques become more advanced, some questions that are now addressed with experiments in monkeys might be better answered by peering into the human brain. “My prediction is that human volunteers will be able to replace monkeys more and more in the next 10-20 years,” says Carbone.Meanwhile in vitro advances are also pointing towards reliable alternative methods. One such advance is the ability to re-program human skin cells into a primordial, stem cell-like state. These “induced pluripotent cells” could be converted into any specialised cell in the body, like liver or kidney cells, and these could be generated from people with a particular illness, giving researchers a potent and patient-specific model of that disease in a dish. Lab-on-a-chip technologies – and perhaps one day, lab-grown organs – could also provide increasingly sophisticated ways to identify disease mechanisms or test prospective medicines.Finding alternativesTrends also show that some sectors are doing more than others to reduce animal use. Some believe technological advances will one day make animal studies unnecessary, while others argue that “non-living” models will never be capable of reliably replicating all of the uses of laboratory mice and other creatures.When many people think about animal testing, they imagine rows of rodent cages in a pharmaceutical company lab. But according to data from European Union countries, the pharmaceutical sector uses almost half the number of animals that academic labs do, and animal use in drug development dropped significantly between 2005 and 2008 – the most recent statistics available. There are two reasons for this, says Thomas Hartung, Director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland. First, drugs are increasingly designed to target specific molecular mechanisms, and these are best identified in culture dishes rather than live animals. Second, conducting experiments in 1,536-well cell culture dishes is vastly less expensive than in animals, so companies are motivated to use alternatives whenever they are available.In the US and the EU, a drug’s efficacy and safety must be tested in animals before it enters human testing, though a 2010 directive from the EU calls for alternatives to be used when possible. Jan Ottesen, vice president of lab animal science at Danish company Novo Nordisk, which makes insulin and other drugs for diabetes and haemophilia, says his company actively seeks out tests that can replace animal use without compromising patient safety. Novo Nordisk decided 15 years ago to replace animal tests with cell cultures to verify the quality of each batch of drugs before it goes to market. The company had to provide the authorities with data proving that other tests worked just as well. It took until 2011 for the company to complete the switch.  However, for some types of experiments there are no equivalent non-animal options, says Ottesen. For example, in searching for new drugs that decrease joint pain due to arthritis, you need a model that mimics the human condition. The important thing, he stressed, is to set up the experiment so as to avoid unnecessary pain. For safety and toxicological testing of drugs, he adds, “I cannot see for the foreseeable future how we can completely avoid it. Having said that, all the replacements that can be implemented should be implemented.""Under pressureSafety testing of substances other than human and veterinary drugs, such as cosmetics, toiletries, household cleaning products and industrial chemicals might be a different story. Currently, says Hartung, such tests are outdated and inaccurate, with toxicity in rodents predicting problems in humans just 43% of the time. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of these substances have undergone no toxicity testing at all.Addressing this gap with animal studies alone would be expensive and impractical. An overhaul of chemical safety regulations in the EU called REACH and a toxicology modernisation initiative led by the US National Institutes of Health, are driving the search for alternatives.Hartung believes that with enough investment and coordination, animal tests on products in this category can be replaced completely. He is leading the Human Toxome Project, an initiative that aims to map the ways substances disrupt hormones and endanger health, as well as to develop advanced, non-animal lab tests for toxicity testing. It’s slow going, Hartung concedes. “We don’t have human data to compare with, or really high-quality animal data,” he says, adding that this makes it tough to evaluate the quality of the tests.Meanwhile, almost four in ten animals are used in basic, as opposed to applied, biological research – and this proportion is growing. Sarah Wolfensohn, a veterinary surgeon who heads Seventeen Eighty Nine, a consultancy advising researchers on animal welfare, based in Swindon, UK, says this is in part because a lot of this type of work is carried out in academia where the financial and performance pressures that motivate interest in non-animal-based techniques are weaker than in the commercial sector.Other factors play a role too, she says. ""For example, if a senior professor in academia has spent his entire career developing experimental techniques on monkeys' brains and young researchers now tell him 'actually we don't need to do this, we can do it on a computer', it undermines his approach.""But just as important as reducing the numbers of animals used, adds Wolfensohn, is “to make sure they are being used in the best way and that their welfare is maximised, so as to get the best quality results, to make sure they are not wasted.”Overall, pressure to limit the use of animals in research – either for financial, scientific or moral reasons – is rising. Meanwhile, the use of animals in many areas of life-science research is on the decline, experts note, even if genetic work in mice is still keeping numbers up. “I think this is temporary,” says Andrew Rowan, President and Chief Executive Officer of animal protection group Humane Society International. “I think it is going to start going down again as we improve our technologies.” How soon this might happen is too difficult to tell.If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.Work with dolphins show it is difficult to strike up a two-way conversationInside the US military project to build a better bomb dogThe giant rats with a remarkable skill Weird and wonderful celebrity-christened species… and why it matters to usA complete ban on the sale of cosmetics developed through animal testing has taken effect in the EU.Electrifying the instrument changed music foreverA regular eating schedule may improve your health and help you lose weightWe have psychological flaws – but they can be overcomeThe huge challenges in taking tourism into orbitThe truth about alcohol warming you up – and other misconceptionsIt could be a life-saving twist on a tradition",1,3,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?

Meanwhile, the use of animals in many areas of life-science research is on the decline, experts note, even if genetic work in mice is still keeping numbers up. “I think this is temporary,” says Andrew Rowan, President and Chief Executive Officer of animal protection group Humane Society International. “I think it is going to start going down again as we improve our technologies.” How soon this might happen is too difficult to tell.If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.Work with dolphins show it is difficult to strike up a two-way conversationInside the US military project to build a better bomb dogThe giant rats with a remarkable skill Weird and wonderful celebrity-christened species… and why it matters to usA complete ban on the sale of cosmetics developed through animal testing has taken effect in the EU.Electrifying the instrument changed music foreverA regular eating schedule may improve your health and help you lose weightWe have psychological flaws – but they can be overcomeThe huge challenges in taking tourism into orbitThe truth about alcohol warming you up – and other misconceptionsIt could be a life-saving twist on a tradition",1575,1556
49,National Anthem Protest,Is Refusing to Stand for the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest?,2s49q4r,https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/why-colin-kaepernicks-nfl-settlement-doesnt-mean-hell-rejoin-league,Why Colin Kaepernick's NFL settlement doesn't mean he'll rejoin league | NBCS Bay Area,"Just a few short years ago, the NFL was more than willing to go the legal distance with a recognizable quarterback.New England Patriots star Tom Brady's appeal of a four-game suspension made its way up the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, or one stop shy of the U.S. Supreme Court, for those of you who fell asleep during civics class in high school. Brady was suspended for allegedly deflating footballs, and the league fought him tooth and nail one stop shy of the nation's highest court.It's telling that the NFL didn't do the same to former 49ers signal-caller Colin Kaepernick and Carolina Panthers safety Eric Reid.The former San Francisco teammates were the first two NFL players to kneel during the national anthem to protest racial inequality and police brutality, and they settled their collusion grievances with the league Friday. An NFL team has not signed Kaepernick since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers following the 2016 season, and Reid did not sign with the Panthers until October. NFL officials speculated to Bleacher Report's Mike Freeman that Kaepernick's settlement ranged from $60 million to $80 million. The settlement avoided the hearing the parties were scheduled for later this month.Considering Brady's legal challenge only ended after he decided not to continue an appeals process nearly 18 months after his initial suspension, that's quite the turnaround. Although Kaepernick would have had to clear a high legal bar to prove collusion, NFL might have settled in order to save its own skin. In August, a mediator first ruled that Kaepernick had raised enough evidence to move forward in his claim. The San Francisco Chronicle's Scott Ostler reported Friday that he previously heard from sources some of that evidence was ""very embarassing"" to the league that would have been made public if the case went to trial, while Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio noted that ""the disclosure of a likely treasure trove of"" various documents ""could have been devastating to the NFL.""We might never know what that evidence could have looked like, or if the NFL truly colluded to keep Kaepernick out of the league. Both sides agreed to confidentiality, after all. But the existence of that agreement discloses plenty on its own, and begs another question: What does it all mean for Kaepernick's future on the field? [RELATED: Colorado sports store closes after Nike, Kaepernick boycott]Unlike Brady, Kaepernick still might not play again. He reportedly has continued to work out and prepare should the opportunity arise, but some teams implied or straight-up said it had been too long since he played back in 2017. What will they say now that his suit is settled, two full seasons after he last played?They'll probably say the same things, paraphrase NFL commissioner Roger Goodell's thoughts and offer up the usual excuses about Kaepernick ""not fitting their system."" There also is the possibility, as Florio noted, that Kaepernick's settlement ""includes a provision that he won’t seek, and won’t be offered, NFL employment.""With the NFL rumor mill ramping up in advance of the start of the league year, we could know whether or not that's the case as soon as next month. Nick Foles, Teddy Bridgewater, Ryan Tannehill and Tyrod Taylor headline a largely uninspiring crop of potential free-agent QBs, and Kaepernick is (at worst) a comparable passer to all four.Of course, that didn't stop all 32 teams from choosing not to sign him before. With his legal challenge officially settled, what's stopping them now? One week of 49ers organized team activities is in the books.Nearly a quarter of the 49ers’ 90-man roster is sidelined by injuries. The good news is that none of the unexpected ailments is expected to keep anyone out of action into the start of the regular season.Let’s open the 49ers Mailbag to see what’s on the minds of those chiming in on Twitter (click here to follow @MaioccoNBCS):Will SF be looking to sign another safety (Tre Boston, Eric Berry, etc) since Jimmie Ward got injured? (@Irfannzo) I do not get that sense.Here’s something I feel confident about stating: If you believe the 49ers have major weaknesses at the safety positions, the organization disagrees with you.Jimmie Ward is expected to be out eight to 12 weeks (I’m hearing the 12-week estimate is being ultra-cautious). The 49ers believe, if healthy, Ward is their best defensive back. Period. So if they believe he is going to be ready from this injury in plenty of time for the regular season, then they also believe there is no reason to react.Of course, this latest injury only adds to the long list of broken bones Ward has experienced since becoming an NFL player. So the 49ers must also be comfortable with the backup.The backup free safety, Adrian Colbert, was the no-questions-asked starter at that position last year at this time. He did not build on the promising end to his rookie season, and now he figures to be No. 2 on the depth chart.There is a segment of 49ers fans who are asking about Eric Berry and Earl Thomas. But applying the same reasoning as the drawback to Ward, those players do not make much sense, either. Berry, 30, has missed 29 games the past two seasons due to injuries. Thomas, 30, has missed 19 games the past three years with injuries. Ward, 27, has missed 21 games the past three years.As for Boston, he is seen as more of a hybrid safety, and not necessarily the kind of player who is a fit for the 49ers’ need. Boston, 26, remains unsigned, and could be heading for his fourth team in four years.Plus, if the 49ers believe a healthy Ward is better than all the available options – and, yes, that’s what I believe the 49ers believe – then, why would one of those veteran players come to the Bay Area on a one-year contract to be an insurance policy?Are the 49ers wrong in their assessment of the safety positions? We’ll find out. But I do not believe they feel an urgent need to bring in a veteran – at this time.Which RB will get the most touches in the regular season? (@EliasMata) The big question with Jerick McKinnon is whether he will be the same player in his first season back from ACL surgery. It might take him a while. Therefore, Tevin Coleman is most likely to be the back who gets the most touches – both as a runner and a receiver.Coleman is the clear favorite with the next three players in line, McKinnon, Matt Breida and Raheem Mostert, unable to participate in OTAs.What do the 49ers have for a succession plan for McGlinchey when he replaces Staley? Will we see that in the draft next year? (@TnNinerfan) Joe Staley enters the final year of his contract. He will be at left tackle for as long as he wants to play – and as long as he continues to play at a high level. Mike McGlinchey moves four spots to this left when Staley steps aside.By the end of this season, the 49ers should have a good idea whether Shon Coleman or Justin Skule -- or someone else on the team -- can start at right tackle for the future. If the long-term answer is not on the team, they will look toward the 2020 draft.How worried should we be about Bosa’s injury situation (@ssschreffler) Nick Bosa sustained a grade-1 right hamstring strain during OTAs on Tuesday. That’s not a big deal at all. Other top defensive rookies, Quinnen Williams (calf) and Josh Allen (knee bruise), are also missing time with their respective teams.If the 49ers want to get Bosa back on the field for the end of OTAs or the mandatory minicamp, they can do that. My guess is they’ll shut him down, as a precaution, to get him ready for the opening of training camp in late-July.But when you take into account his history, then I can completely understand the concern. It was Bosa's only real drawback as a draft prospect.Who do you predict will play more snaps on the defensive line in 2019 between Armstead and Thomas? (@Citizen510) Arik Armstead is a very good run defender. That’s his forte. Solomon Thomas is still trying to find his niche. I think they will both get a lot of playing time, but my guess is Armtead sees more playing time.The 49ers’ adjustments on the defensive line should benefit both players. So, ultimately, the 49ers will ride the player who gets hotter as an inside pass rusher in nickel situations.Matt, who do you think the favorite is to start at SAM now that the 49ers are moving to a more traditional 4-3 front in their 9-wide scheme? (@Chazcast)Mark Nzeocha lined up at the strong side position with the first team last week during OTAs. But I’ll go with Malcolm Smith as the starter, as long as he’s healthy. The 49ers would not have restructured Smith's contract and brought him back if they viewed him as a backup and special-teams player.My wife and I take ""gamecations"" from Santa Fe, NM every year. Which away game do feel is best to go see this season? Unfortunately, we chose Seattle last season. (@ShanoPerez) OK, now we’re talking.

That makes it a crap shoot of what you’ll be getting. Arizona is good, but I dropped it down to last place this year because not a lot of people can get away for a Thursday game.I also believe the rest of the trip should build up to the game, not the other way around.Who is the best tight end in the NFL?Well, believe it or not, 49ers GM John Lynch isn't 100 percent confident saying George Kittle deserves that title.Nevertheless, Sporting News declared the 25-year-old is the best guy in the league at the position -- and there is plenty to back up that statement.Last season, the Iowa product set the 49ers franchise record for receiving yards by a tight end in a single season with 1,377. He also averaged 15.6 yards per catch, which Sporting News' Vinnie Iyer dubbed as ""ridiculous."" And he's not wrong. Kittle should benefit even more from a full season with Jimmy Garoppolo, who also will have new pass-catching weapons Deebo Samuel, Jalen Hurd and Jordan Matthews at his disposal.

It seems like yesterday that Minnesota Duluth was raising its national championship banner on opening night of the 2018-19 season. Now just over a month separates us from Selection Sunday for the 2019 NCAA tournament.Scoreboard | Rankings | Stats Another weekend of college hockey caused some ripples in the brackets. Ohio State, with a chance to clinch its first conference regular season championship since the CCHA’s inaugural year in 1971-72, was swept out of a number 1 seed by Minnesota. Others made the most of an opportunity to move into top spots or get back on the right side of the bubble.For a refresher on how the NCAA selection committee chooses the 16 teams, check out our article on everything you need to know about the selection process. Otherwise, let’s get right to the teams and our bracket in this week’s edition of bracketology.This Week’s Bracketology (as of February 20, 2019):T-1. St. Cloud State (NCHC) T-1. Massachusetts (Hockey East) 3. Minnesota Duluth 4. Denver 5. Minnesota State (WCHA) 6. Quinnipiac 7. Ohio State (Big Ten) T-8. Arizona State T-8. Western Michigan T-8. Cornell (ECAC) 11. Northeastern T-12. Providence T-12. Clarkson 14. UMass Lowell 15. Harvard  35. American International (Atlantic Hockey)Since no team can earn an automatic bid before conference tournaments are played, this bracketology assumes the school with the top in-conference winning percentage in each of the six conferences earns the automatic bid. That school is noted with the conference in parenthesis.For a third straight week, American International leads Atlantic Hockey, bumping Bowling Green from the top 16. Each of the other five conference leaders are within the top 16, which this week is good news for Harvard.Beanpot Repeat: Northeastern's Beanpot win could propel team to postseason successBefore seeding the teams, three different ties need to be broken. Two deal with placing teams on different sides of seed breaks. Besides the weekly St. Cloud State and Massachusetts tie, Arizona State, Western Michigan and Cornell all have 51 comparison wins thanks to the Big Red sweeping the Sun Devils earlier this season. Cornell holds ASU’s comparison, moving the Big Red up and Arizona State down to Western Michigan’s level. Lastly, Providence and Clarkson are tied for 12th, meaning whichever team gets placed ahead of the other would be a three seed.Using RPI as a tiebreaker, St. Cloud State is placed above the Minutemen, Arizona State is eighth, Western Michigan is ninth and Cornell is tenth, and Providence gets the three seed with Clarkson being a four seed.Teams By conference: ECAC: 4 Hockey East: 4 NCHC: 4 Atlantic Hockey: 1 Big Ten: 1 WCHA: 1 Independent: 1In this week: Providence Out this week: Bowling GreenTime to seed.This Week’s Seeding Groups No. 1 seeds: St. Cloud State, Massachusetts, Minnesota Duluth, Denver No. 2 seeds: Minnesota State, Quinnipiac, Ohio State, Arizona State No. 3 seeds: Western Michigan, Cornell, Northeastern, Providence No. 4 seeds: Clarkson, UMass Lowell, Harvard, American InternationalStep 2 is to place the home team of each regional since host teams automatically play at its home regional. None are in this week’s bracket. Brown, not Providence, hosts the East Regional in Providence, RI.5 teams who could make their first Frozen Four in 2019Step 3 fills out the bracket with the idea of avoiding first-round inter-conference matchups. Somehow, despite ECAC, NCHC and Hockey East each sending four teams, no inter-conference matchups occur on a 1-16, 2-15, etc. straight bracket.For that reason, this week’s bracket ends up being fairly straightforward.The Bracket:Northeast Regional (Manchester, NH): 2. Massachusetts vs. 15. Harvard 6. Quinnipiac vs. 11. NortheasternEast Regional (Providence, RI): 4. Denver vs. 13. Clarkson 5. Minnesota State vs. 12. ProvidenceMidwest Regional (Allentown, PA): 3. Minnesota Duluth vs. 14. UMass Lowell 7. Ohio State vs. 10. CornellWest Regional (Fargo, ND):  1. St. Cloud State vs. 16. American International 8. Arizona State vs. 9. Western MichiganHow did we get here?We get here with one small switch for attendance. Things work out extremely well going by the true 1-16, 2-15, etc. straight bracket and placing the top seeds, in order, to its nearby regions. St. Cloud State ends up in Fargo, Massachusetts goes to in Manchester, Minnesota Duluth heads to Allentown, and Denver, by process of elimination, is in Providence.Filling out the rest of a true bracket even means Providence ends up with Providence by itself against the lowest number 1 seed. Almost too good to be true.Frozen Four 2019: Everything you need to knowWho had the biggest changes this week?One of the best ways for a team to move up involves beating top teams. Denver, facing Minnesota Duluth, moved up three spots with a win against the Bulldogs on Saturday. The win gave the NCHC three of the four No. 1 seeds. Providence, meanwhile, continues to be the proverbial bubble yo-yo. Since January 21st, the Friars have from week to week: Moved down 6, moved up 6, moved down 5, moved down 2 and moved up 5. Needing a good result following a 1-3 stretch, PC swept UMass Lowell in Hockey East play. Harvard’s late come-from-behind win over St. Lawrence avoided a disastrous drop.Lowell, on the other hand, was one of several teams who dropped as the River Hawks’ 9-0-1 unbeaten run came to an end. Ohio State, a No. 1 seed for the past two weeks in the midst of a seven-game winning streak, dropped down four spots to a No. 2 seed after being swept by the Gophers. AIC kept its spot in this week’s bracketology yet dropped seven spots after being swept by Arizona State, who inched extremely close to its first NCAA tournament.Lastly, Bowling Green dropped one spot after tying Alaska on Saturday; the one spot that is the difference between being in and out of the NCAA tournament. A win instead would have kept the Falcons on the right side of the bubble.Who missed an opportunity?Besides Bowling Green, both Penn State and Notre Dame had opportunities to go from outside the bubble to in the tournament with series against Michigan State and Wisconsin, respectively. If one or both was able to sweep, that team would move into an at-large spot. Both split — as has been the case throughout much of Big Ten conference play — and remain two of the first three teams out.NCAA in the pros: 13 NHL first-round draft picks you can still watch playing college hockeyNorth Dakota also could have jumped into an at-large spot if the Fighting Hawks completed a road sweep of Western Michigan on Saturday.

It seems like yesterday that Minnesota Duluth was raising its national championship banner on opening night of the 2018-19 season. Now just over a month separates us from Selection Sunday for the 2019 NCAA tournament.Scoreboard | Rankings | Stats Another weekend of college hockey caused some ripples in the brackets. Ohio State, with a chance to clinch its first conference regular season championship since the CCHA’s inaugural year in 1971-72, was swept out of a number 1 seed by Minnesota. Others made the most of an opportunity to move into top spots or get back on the right side of the bubble.For a refresher on how the NCAA selection committee chooses the 16 teams, check out our article on everything you need to know about the selection process. Otherwise, let’s get right to the teams and our bracket in this week’s edition of bracketology.This Week’s Bracketology (as of February 20, 2019):T-1. St. Cloud State (NCHC) T-1. Massachusetts (Hockey East) 3. Minnesota Duluth 4. Denver 5. Minnesota State (WCHA) 6. Quinnipiac 7. Ohio State (Big Ten) T-8. Arizona State T-8. Western Michigan T-8. Cornell (ECAC) 11. Northeastern T-12. Providence T-12. Clarkson 14. UMass Lowell 15. Harvard  35. American International (Atlantic Hockey)Since no team can earn an automatic bid before conference tournaments are played, this bracketology assumes the school with the top in-conference winning percentage in each of the six conferences earns the automatic bid. That school is noted with the conference in parenthesis.For a third straight week, American International leads Atlantic Hockey, bumping Bowling Green from the top 16. Each of the other five conference leaders are within the top 16, which this week is good news for Harvard.Beanpot Repeat: Northeastern's Beanpot win could propel team to postseason successBefore seeding the teams, three different ties need to be broken. Two deal with placing teams on different sides of seed breaks. Besides the weekly St. Cloud State and Massachusetts tie, Arizona State, Western Michigan and Cornell all have 51 comparison wins thanks to the Big Red sweeping the Sun Devils earlier this season. Cornell holds ASU’s comparison, moving the Big Red up and Arizona State down to Western Michigan’s level. Lastly, Providence and Clarkson are tied for 12th, meaning whichever team gets placed ahead of the other would be a three seed.Using RPI as a tiebreaker, St. Cloud State is placed above the Minutemen, Arizona State is eighth, Western Michigan is ninth and Cornell is tenth, and Providence gets the three seed with Clarkson being a four seed.Teams By conference: ECAC: 4 Hockey East: 4 NCHC: 4 Atlantic Hockey: 1 Big Ten: 1 WCHA: 1 Independent: 1In this week: Providence Out this week: Bowling GreenTime to seed.This Week’s Seeding Groups No. 1 seeds: St. Cloud State, Massachusetts, Minnesota Duluth, Denver No. 2 seeds: Minnesota State, Quinnipiac, Ohio State, Arizona State No. 3 seeds: Western Michigan, Cornell, Northeastern, Providence No. 4 seeds: Clarkson, UMass Lowell, Harvard, American InternationalStep 2 is to place the home team of each regional since host teams automatically play at its home regional. None are in this week’s bracket. Brown, not Providence, hosts the East Regional in Providence, RI.5 teams who could make their first Frozen Four in 2019Step 3 fills out the bracket with the idea of avoiding first-round inter-conference matchups. Somehow, despite ECAC, NCHC and Hockey East each sending four teams, no inter-conference matchups occur on a 1-16, 2-15, etc. straight bracket.For that reason, this week’s bracket ends up being fairly straightforward.The Bracket:Northeast Regional (Manchester, NH): 2. Massachusetts vs. 15. Harvard 6. Quinnipiac vs. 11. NortheasternEast Regional (Providence, RI): 4. Denver vs. 13. Clarkson 5. Minnesota State vs. 12. ProvidenceMidwest Regional (Allentown, PA): 3. Minnesota Duluth vs. 14. UMass Lowell 7. Ohio State vs. 10. CornellWest Regional (Fargo, ND):  1. St. Cloud State vs. 16. American International 8. Arizona State vs. 9. Western MichiganHow did we get here?We get here with one small switch for attendance. Things work out extremely well going by the true 1-16, 2-15, etc. straight bracket and placing the top seeds, in order, to its nearby regions. St. Cloud State ends up in Fargo, Massachusetts goes to in Manchester, Minnesota Duluth heads to Allentown, and Denver, by process of elimination, is in Providence.Filling out the rest of a true bracket even means Providence ends up with Providence by itself against the lowest number 1 seed. Almost too good to be true.Frozen Four 2019: Everything you need to knowWho had the biggest changes this week?One of the best ways for a team to move up involves beating top teams. Denver, facing Minnesota Duluth, moved up three spots with a win against the Bulldogs on Saturday. The win gave the NCHC three of the four No. 1 seeds. Providence, meanwhile, continues to be the proverbial bubble yo-yo. Since January 21st, the Friars have from week to week: Moved down 6, moved up 6, moved down 5, moved down 2 and moved up 5. Needing a good result following a 1-3 stretch, PC swept UMass Lowell in Hockey East play. Harvard’s late come-from-behind win over St. Lawrence avoided a disastrous drop.Lowell, on the other hand, was one of several teams who dropped as the River Hawks’ 9-0-1 unbeaten run came to an end. Ohio State, a No. 1 seed for the past two weeks in the midst of a seven-game winning streak, dropped down four spots to a No. 2 seed after being swept by the Gophers. AIC kept its spot in this week’s bracketology yet dropped seven spots after being swept by Arizona State, who inched extremely close to its first NCAA tournament.Lastly, Bowling Green dropped one spot after tying Alaska on Saturday; the one spot that is the difference between being in and out of the NCAA tournament. A win instead would have kept the Falcons on the right side of the bubble.Who missed an opportunity?Besides Bowling Green, both Penn State and Notre Dame had opportunities to go from outside the bubble to in the tournament with series against Michigan State and Wisconsin, respectively. If one or both was able to sweep, that team would move into an at-large spot. Both split — as has been the case throughout much of Big Ten conference play — and remain two of the first three teams out.NCAA in the pros: 13 NHL first-round draft picks you can still watch playing college hockeyNorth Dakota also could have jumped into an at-large spot if the Fighting Hawks completed a road sweep of Western Michigan on Saturday. Incidentally, the Broncos winning was the difference between ninth and 15th this week. Yale and Lake Superior State each swept its opposition to keep hopes of an at-large bid alive.We’ll be back next week with another look at the NCAA tournament and an updated bracket.Enter your information to receive emails about offers, promotions from NCAA.com and our partners",1193,1175
4,Vaccines for Kids,Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?,1s4q8r,https://www.kgun9.com/news/local-news/arizona-lawmakers-consider-religious-exemption-for-vaccines,Arizona lawmakers consider religious exemption for vaccines,"PHOENIX — Arizona lawmakers are looking at expanding exemptions from children’s vaccine requirements as public health officials in the Pacific Northwest try to contain a measles outbreak that has sickened dozens of people who were not inoculated. Republicans on a state House committee voted Thursday to create a religious exemption for schoolchildren, adding to the personal beliefs exemption Arizona already has. The measure also would get rid of a requirement for parents who decline to vaccinate to sign a form listing the risks. It was one of three measures lawmakers approved in party-line votes after hearing hours of testimony from doctors supporting vaccinations and others who disagree with the scientific consensus that they’re safe. One bill would require doctors to provide lengthy information about all the ingredients in immunizations. The other would require them to tell patients about an antibody test that may help determine if someone is already immune to a disease. Approving the bills lends credence to skepticism of vaccines, Dr. Steven Brown, a family physician in Phoenix, told lawmakers. “Voting in favor of any of these bills and encouraging more exemptions for vaccinations is dangerous to our citizens and sends the wrong message to Arizonans,” Brown said. “Let’s send the message that Arizona cares deeply about public health, children and science.” Rep. Nancy Barto, a Phoenix Republican who sponsored the bills, said they’re about promoting religious freedom and informed consent. “Frankly these are not in my view anti-vaccination bills,” Barto said. “They are discussions about fundamental individual rights.” The measures still require approval in the full House of Representatives, and it’s not clear they will have enough support in the body, which Republicans control by a slim 31-29 margin. The Senate health committee rejected similar legislation earlier in the week. The hearing began with a 90-minute presentation by two people who said the media and pharmaceutical companies conspire to scare parents into vaccinating their children. Opponents were given a few minutes each to make their case. Doctors worry the measures would lead to lower rates of vaccination, endangering people who rely on others to be vaccinated because they have a health condition that prevents inoculation. The public health benefits of widespread vaccination far outweigh the rare instances when vaccines cause harm, said Democratic Rep. Amish Shah, an emergency room physician. The Arizona legislation goes against recent trends in state vaccine legislation, which have generally cracked down on exemptions rather than expanding them. California eliminated its personal beliefs exemption following an outbreak at Disneyland, allowing parents to opt-out only if a physician determines there’s a medical need. In Washington state, the epicenter of the ongoing outbreak, lawmakers are considering eliminating the personal beliefs exemption allowing parents to opt their children out of the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. In Arizona, parents can cite a religious exemption to opt their children out of vaccines required for child care centers, but must use a “personal beliefs” exemption once children reach school age. Barto’s bill would allow parents to cite either reason for exempting their child from vaccines regardless of age. It’s unclear if the change would lead more parents to opt out, but Cathi Herrod, head of the social-conservative group Center for Arizona Progress, said parents should be able to explicitly exercise their constitutional right to religious freedom. Especially worrisome, said Democratic Rep. Kelli Butler, is the elimination of a requirement that parents sign an opt-out form that specifies the risks of each disease they’re declining to inoculate their children against. Barto said that’s important because parents shouldn’t have to sign a form they disagree with. GOP lawmakers also voted to require that doctors provide a list of all the ingredients in a vaccine before administering it. Supporters said that would allow parents to make an informed decision. Doctors said it would require them to hand out 30-plus pages of complicated medical information that’s more likely to confuse than inform patients or parents. “A lot of people will not understand a third of what you just handed them,” Dr. Negin Blattman, an infectious disease specialist, told lawmakers. “I have trouble understanding it.”",1,8,Neutral,Neutral,Against,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Against']","Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?

(AP) - A Somersworth family is looking for a hat trick of community support to send Rochester police officer Keith MacKenzie to next month’s annual Battle of the Badges hockey game in honor of a boy fighting a rare disease.The family is hoping for a large turnout this Saturday at a community spaghetti dinner and raffle night to raise the funds MacKenzie needs to skate in honor of Brycen Allen Berube, 7, of Somersworth, for the third year in a row.Brycen has the rare genetic disease neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), which has caused multiple tumors in his brain and behind his optic nerves. This year, Brycen gets to drop the puck during the ceremonial opening faceoff at Battle of the Badges, adding a special layer to his favorite part of Children’s Hospital at Dartmouth-Hitchcock’s annual police vs. firefighters game.“When the blue team wins,” Brycen said when asked what he enjoys most about the game, referring to the fact Team Police has the bested red Team Fire each of the last three years.The spaghetti and meatballs fundraiser for MacKenzie and Brycen is from 5 to 8 p.m. Saturday at American Legion Post 69 in Somersworth. The all-you-can-eat dinner costs $8 for adults and $5 for children, according to Tammy Ruddy, Brycen’s grandmother and guardian.Ruddy said numerous Tri-City businesses and organizations have donated food and support, as well as gift cards and items for raffles. She said the significant community support they’ve already received makes her confident they’ll surpass the $1,500 MacKenzie must raise to play in CHaD’s Battle of the Badges.“The support is overwhelming,” said Ruddy, the Somersworth Housing Authority’s public housing coordinator.The full-contact Battle of the Battles game will then be held at 5 p.m. on Saturday, March 16, at SNHU Arena in Manchester.Since 2008, the game has used good-natured first responder rivalry to raise money to provide critical child and family support services while children receive intensive care and treatment for cancer and other chronic illnesses at CHaD. The 2018 Battle of the Badges raised a record $286,000 in 2018, according to CHaD’s website for the game, chadhockey.org.MacKenzie, a Rochester K9 officer and a Team Police forward and assistant captain, is the only officer who has skated in every Battle of the Badges game. A number of other Seacoast-area officers and firefighters will also skate in this year’s Battle of the Badges.MacKenzie met Brycen thanks to his frequent work with the Somersworth Housing Authority, quickly forming a bond with the energetic youngster. Ruddy said MacKenzie has become like family to them.“I wasn’t going to play more than 10 years,” the 41-year-old MacKenzie said of Battle of the Badges, hinting at the physical toll, “but I’ve kept going because of Brycen. It’s good to give back, and I get to see how it helps kids firsthand. It’s for a great cause.”Ruddy said the support funded by Battle of the Badges has gone a long way in helping Brycen feel happy and comfortable while he’s undergone demanding treatments at CHaD over the years. Ruddy said they’ve also helped her a great deal as well, as CHaD uses some of the funds to cover the single guardian’s gas to get to CHaD.Brycen started his second round of weekly chemotherapy treatments last November, although he’s missed the last couple because his weight has dropped too low. He’s currently battling two brain tumors and a tumor behind his left optic nerve. He’s a fighter, though, said Ruddy.“We did it before, and we’ll do it again,” she said as Brycen played with his cousins Monday morning.___Online: https://bit.ly/2GVTVSb___Information from: Foster’s Daily Democrat, http://www.fosters.comCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

49,National Anthem Protest,Is Refusing to Stand for the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest?,2s49q7r,http://www.capeandislands.org/post/barbershop-super-bowl-politics,Barbershop: Super Bowl Politics | WCAI,"MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: And finally today, we're going to head into the Barbershop. That's where we invite interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And, yes, there's an awful lot going on in the news today. But we decided to talk about Super Bowl LIII, which is tomorrow in Atlanta.We decided to focus on that because the Super Bowl is usually the most-watched or one of the most-watched television programs of the year. Usually, more than 100,000,000 watch it along with the halftime show and the commercials. And there have been controversies before about the game or the show, but this year, it seems as though the controversy or controversies are the story, from the officiating in the playoffs to the number of artists who apparently declined to perform during a halftime show in support of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who hasn't played in two seasons after setting off a wave of activism and condemnation for kneeling during the national anthem.We wanted to talk about all of that, so we've called three people who've thought about the issues that we're talking about here. And joining us now is Mark Leibovich. He's the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine. He's also the author of ""Big Game: The NFL In Dangerous Times.""Welcome.MARK LEIBOVICH: Good to be here.MARTIN: We're also joined by Rodney Carmichael, who reports on hip-hop for NPR and NPR Music.Glad to have you back, Rodney.LEIBOVICH: Hey, Michel. Thanks.MARTIN: And Megan McArdle is with us. She's opinion columnist at The Washington Post.Welcome back to you as well.MEGAN MCARDLE: Thanks for having me.MARTIN: And Mark, I'm going to start with you because you're a political reporter first, but you took some time off to report and write a book that looks at the inner workings of the NFL. And guess what? You're still covering politics.LEIBOVICH: (Laughter).MARTIN: So is the Super Bowl more fraught this year than it's been before? If that's true, why is that? And is that OK?LEIBOVICH: Absolutely it is more fraught, just like everything is more politicized. And you're right. I mean, I decided to take a break from politics to jump into the National Football League for a couple of years, and, like, there is no break whatsoever. Since Donald Trump came upon the scene, everything has been more divided, including the Super Bowl.MARTIN: And, Megan, you've written kind of - I don't know, despairingly - do you think that's a fair word...MCARDLE: (Laughter) Yes.MARTIN: ...About that very issue. I mean, you've said that there don't seem to be any places, safe spaces that don't have politics attached to them, be it the NFL or the Oscars or any public awards show.MCARDLE: Yeah.MARTIN: Is that really a bad thing?MCARDLE: I think it's getting more and more like that. I think my favorite episode of this was that after the election, Penzeys Spices, where I buy a lot of spaces - the owner is very anti-Trump, and it turns out that there's another spice company owned by his brother and sister-in-law, and they came out and said, well, we love everyone. And so now there is a Republican and a Democratic place to buy your bulk cinnamon. And I think that that's really - it sort of sums up where America is today.MARTIN: So tell us about the NFL, though. I mean, do you - you know, obviously people have very different feelings about the whole kneeling controversy and what that means and the fact that two years later, it's still having an effect - the fact that, you know, artists - Rodney's going to talk more about that - are saying in support of Kaepernick and in support of the idea that he has a right to protest that they decided not to participate in something that would normally be a plum opportunity for them.MCARDLE: Right.MARTIN: Is that...MCARDLE: I mean, look, I think...MARTIN: ...Wrong?MCARDLE: ...That this is incredibly divisive, and people are taking stands on something they feel very strongly about. And I think one of the things that I have observed about all of this is the complete inability of either side of that debate - you know, I see both sides of that to some extent. I think Kaepernick certainly has a right to protest and that the artists certainly have a right to say no. Like, stand up - I admire people who stand up for what they believe in, even at personal cost.But just the inability to kind of even frame the debate in a way that you can have a discussion about it because people cannot see beyond, I am outraged because he won't stand for the national anthem. I am outraged because he is being punished for not standing for the national anthem. And there's just - there's sort of no in between anymore, and it's really a sad place that America's come to.MARTIN: Rodney, how do you see all this?RODNEY CARMICHAEL, BYLINE: I mean, I think the thing we have to remember is, you know, there's really no form of racial justice protest that America has ever been supportive of. You know, in civil rights era, they fought back with dogs and water hoses. In Black Lives Matter, it was rubber bullets. You know, you've come to Atlanta with the Super Bowl. It is the black mecca. It's the home of civil rights. It's the home of hip-hop. There's no way that, you know, the NFL isn't going to be confronted in terms of their stance on racial politics.MARTIN: And what is your thought about the fact that there could be or should be some place that is devoid of politics - that people could kind of just agree to take off - well, in hockey, take off your gloves has a different meaning...(LAUGHTER)MARTIN: So we'll...CARMICHAEL: Right.MARTIN: ...Use the other meaning of take off your gloves - just kind of chill.CARMICHAEL: Yeah. I mean, the thing is, you have to remember, like, there's a reason for protest in this country, and it's because black people, marginalized people don't have any other means of access in terms of historically being able to get their voice heard in systems of power. So protesting and, you know, at times like this where it seems like it's comfortable for everybody else - it's not comfortable for everybody else and for black folks at these other times, so that's why we're having protests at times like this.MARTIN: So, Mark, talk a little bit more about where that that whole thing is. It's not like the main feature of your book about the NFL, but it's certainly...LEIBOVICH: It intervened.MARTIN: ...Bubbling under the...LEIBOVICH: Oh, there's no question.MARTIN: It's infused...LEIBOVICH: Well...MARTIN: Right?LEIBOVICH: Like, the reason I wanted to write about the National Football League is it has become the - just the great spectacle of American life. I mean, something like 48 of the top 50 top-watch shows in America every year are football games. Donald Trump became the other great spectacle of American life, the other great reality show. He's wanted to end the National Football League for years, and he just sort of belly-flopped right into the middle of this pool. And this becomes a proxy fight for whether you support Donald Trump or not.MARTIN: And is this still, do you think - you know, it's interesting because at one point, hundreds of NFL players were kneeling, and then it became very fraught and complicated. Even some of the owners - one owner, let's say...LEIBOVICH: Right.MARTIN: One owner at one point knelt with his team.LEIBOVICH: Right - for one week.MARTIN: But has it - has that - is this - is that controversy - so we're going to talk about the entertainers in a minute.LEIBOVICH: Yeah.MARTIN: But is it still something that is very present for the league?LEIBOVICH: It's present in that Colin Kaepernick does not have a job, and people are acutely aware of that. But no, protest has not been a big story this year. Donald Trump has essentially laid off, and he was occupied on the midterms and the shutdown and so forth. So - but it's very much beneath the surface. And, again, the Colin Kaepernick situation is something that a lot of people who are outside the league are very quick to weigh in on, musical acts being a great example here.MARTIN: Megan, can I just ask you briefly about this? But not to belabor the point, but could you just address Rodney's point for a minute? I mean, Rodney's point is that, you know, the idea that some people get to have a safe place where they cannot think about the broader issues in their lives is something that some people never had. I mean, they're going back to - you know, how many - it was a great writer who said, you know, what is the fourth of July to the Negro? And did you see my point? So...MCARDLE: Absolutely. No, look, I think that's an absolutely valid point. And I think there's kind of two questions you have to separate in that. And one is, does the country need places where it can come together on a non-political footing? And I would say it does. I'm not going to tell a player protesting police brutality no, right? I'm not going to say that. I'm just saying, like, it is sad to watch all of those spaces collapsing at once, and it is sad that the NFL is one of them. I'm not saying that, you know, I therefore think Colin Kaepernick did something wrong or that the players did something wrong.I think the second question, which is a different question, is, tactically, does this advance your cause? And I'm more skeptical on that front. I'm skeptical that the particular form of protest chosen - it gets a lot of attention. But there's often in protesting - and I, you know, I did a lot of protesting in college, and I've looked at a lot of the social science literature on this - and it turns out that there's often a direct tradeoff in protesting between how much attention you get and how much good you're actually doing. The more attention you're getting, often, that attention is negative.You have turned off - it's like closing down highways as a form of protest. Yes, you have attracted a lot of attention, but all of the people whose attention you have attracted hate you, so that, you know, you do have to think about. And I'm not sure that this has actually been a tactically effective protest, which is completely separate from the moral legitimacy of doing it.MARTIN: So, Rodney, talk a little bit more about Atlanta, if you would...CARMICHAEL: Right.MARTIN: ...And the significance of this event to Atlanta. And then talk a little bit, if you would, about the calculation, or the - calculation, is that right? - the debate that a number of artists have had about whether or not to participate.CARMICHAEL: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's definitely an interesting time to converge upon Atlanta. You know, like I said, it's the black mecca in a lot of ways, especially in pop culture. You've got, you know, hip-hop capital, you've got the legacy of civil rights, the home of Dr. King. And so, you know, I think coming to Atlanta made the Kaepernick thing and the NFL that much more impossible for the NFL to escape, you know? And it's a confrontation in a lot of ways. But I think, for a lot of entertainers, it's been one of those things where your decision is your politics, and, you know, your politics affect your pocket. And so all of that is in play.MARTIN: So what about Big Boi, Travis Scott, Maroon 5...CARMICHAEL: Yeah.MARTIN: ...Gladys Knight, who...CARMICHAEL: Yeah.MARTIN: ...Are participating. What is it for them? I know that's a lot of people to talk about. But maybe...CARMICHAEL: Well...MARTIN: ...Talk about Travis Scott and Big Boi.MARTIN: Yeah. I mean, Big Boi, he's, you know, home of outcasts, home of Atlanta. He's done a lot for the city. I think one of the really interesting things about all of the people that are performing that you name - they all have ties to the same manager, Irving Azoff, whose management company has - you know, he's been a really power player in the music industry for a long time. So, you know, you have this situation where a lot of performers are performing on a stage at a time when a lot of people don't want them to. And I think you have to kind of look at the machinations of the music industry and how that plays...MARTIN: Briefly, is it a plus or a minus for these artists? Will it be at the end of this?CARMICHAEL: It's a little more nuanced than that, you know? I think - you know, there's still a lot of black fans of the NFL. A lot of black fans are going to be watching the Super Bowl. I think that you've got to be able to use your mike to say something in this country, and, you know, hip-hop has that tradition. So for Big Boi and Travis Scott, I think they're going to be between a rock and a hard place if they don't figure that out.MARTIN: Mark, very briefly?LEIBOVICH: Well, I would say yes. I mean, I think the racial politics of this are also inescapable. I mean, the Atlanta Falcons have a actually 40 percent black season ticket base, which is just unprecedented in the league. And Maroon 5 made some news this week by refusing to hold a press conference. So there's speculation they might have a surprise in store. This is very much in keeping with the reality show.MARTIN: Very briefly - such a cliche - Rams or Patriots? I'm sorry. I have to do it.LEIBOVICH: You know, I grew up in New England, so I, as a birthright, root for the Patriots. And I know everyone else is rooting against them.MARTIN: That's true. Rodney?CARMICHAEL: (Laughter) I'm going to pick Atlanta. I'm rooting for Atlanta.MARTIN: OK. Megan?MCARDLE: I come out - I'm descended from Boston people, so I have to also go with the Patriots, or they will kill me.MARTIN: OK (laughter). That's Megan McArdle of The Washington Post, Mark Leibovich, New York Times chief national correspondent, and NPR Music hip-hop writer Rodney Carmichael.Thank you all so much for joining us.CARMICHAEL: Thanks so much.MCARDLE: Thanks for having me.(SOUNDBITE OF LIL WAYNE FEAT. DRAKE SONG, ""RIGHT ABOVE IT"") Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",2,7,Neutral,Neutral,Pro,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Pro']","Is Refusing to Stand for the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest? Barbershop: Super Bowl Politics | WCAI MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: And finally today, we're going to head into the Barbershop. That's where we invite interesting people to talk about what's in the news and what's on their minds. And, yes, there's an awful lot going on in the news today. But we decided to talk about Super Bowl LIII, which is tomorrow in Atlanta.We decided to focus on that because the Super Bowl is usually the most-watched or one of the most-watched television programs of the year. Usually, more than 100,000,000 watch it along with the halftime show and the commercials. And there have been controversies before about the game or the show, but this year, it seems as though the controversy or controversies are the story, from the officiating in the playoffs to the number of artists who apparently declined to perform during a halftime show in support of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who hasn't played in two seasons after setting off a wave of activism and condemnation for kneeling during the national anthem.We wanted to talk about all of that, so we've called three people who've thought about the issues that we're talking about here. And joining us now is Mark Leibovich. He's the chief national correspondent for The New York Times Magazine. He's also the author of ""Big Game: The NFL In Dangerous Times.""Welcome.MARK LEIBOVICH: Good to be here.MARTIN: We're also joined by Rodney Carmichael, who reports on hip-hop for NPR and NPR Music.Glad to have you back, Rodney.LEIBOVICH: Hey, Michel. Thanks.MARTIN: And Megan McArdle is with us. She's opinion columnist at The Washington Post.Welcome back to you as well.MEGAN MCARDLE: Thanks for having me.MARTIN: And Mark, I'm going to start with you because you're a political reporter first, but you took some time off to report and write a book that looks at the inner workings of the NFL. And guess what? You're still covering politics.LEIBOVICH: (Laughter).MARTIN: So is the Super Bowl more fraught this year than it's been before? If that's true, why is that? And is that OK?LEIBOVICH: Absolutely it is more fraught, just like everything is more politicized. And you're right. I mean, I decided to take a break from politics to jump into the National Football League for a couple of years, and, like, there is no break whatsoever. Since Donald Trump came upon the scene, everything has been more divided, including the Super Bowl.MARTIN: And, Megan, you've written kind of - I don't know, despairingly - do you think that's a fair word...MCARDLE: (Laughter) Yes.MARTIN: ...About that very issue. I mean, you've said that there don't seem to be any places, safe spaces that don't have politics attached to them, be it the NFL or the Oscars or any public awards show.MCARDLE: Yeah.MARTIN: Is that really a bad thing?MCARDLE: I think it's getting more and more like that. I think my favorite episode of this was that after the election, Penzeys Spices, where I buy a lot of spaces - the owner is very anti-Trump, and it turns out that there's another spice company owned by his brother and sister-in-law, and they came out and said, well, we love everyone. And so now there is a Republican and a Democratic place to buy your bulk cinnamon. And I think that that's really - it sort of sums up where America is today.MARTIN: So tell us about the NFL, though. I mean, do you - you know, obviously people have very different feelings about the whole kneeling controversy and what that means and the fact that two years later, it's still having an effect - the fact that, you know, artists - Rodney's going to talk more about that - are saying in support of Kaepernick and in support of the idea that he has a right to protest that they decided not to participate in something that would normally be a plum opportunity for them.MCARDLE: Right.MARTIN: Is that...MCARDLE: I mean, look, I think...MARTIN: ...Wrong?MCARDLE: ...That this is incredibly divisive, and people are taking stands on something they feel very strongly about. And I think one of the things that I have observed about all of this is the complete inability of either side of that debate - you know, I see both sides of that to some extent. I think Kaepernick certainly has a right to protest and that the artists certainly have a right to say no. Like, stand up - I admire people who stand up for what they believe in, even at personal cost.But just the inability to kind of even frame the debate in a way that you can have a discussion about it because people cannot see beyond, I am outraged because he won't stand for the national anthem. I am outraged because he is being punished for not standing for the national anthem. And there's just - there's sort of no in between anymore, and it's really a sad place that America's come to.MARTIN: Rodney, how do you see all this?RODNEY CARMICHAEL, BYLINE: I mean, I think the thing we have to remember is, you know, there's really no form of racial justice protest that America has ever been supportive of. You know, in civil rights era, they fought back with dogs and water hoses. In Black Lives Matter, it was rubber bullets. You know, you've come to Atlanta with the Super Bowl. It is the black mecca. It's the home of civil rights. It's the home of hip-hop. There's no way that, you know, the NFL isn't going to be confronted in terms of their stance on racial politics.MARTIN: And what is your thought about the fact that there could be or should be some place that is devoid of politics - that people could kind of just agree to take off - well, in hockey, take off your gloves has a different meaning...(LAUGHTER)MARTIN: So we'll...CARMICHAEL: Right.MARTIN: ...Use the other meaning of take off your gloves - just kind of chill.CARMICHAEL: Yeah. I mean, the thing is, you have to remember, like, there's a reason for protest in this country, and it's because black people, marginalized people don't have any other means of access in terms of historically being able to get their voice heard in systems of power. So protesting and, you know, at times like this where it seems like it's comfortable for everybody else - it's not comfortable for everybody else and for black folks at these other times, so that's why we're having protests at times like this.MARTIN: So, Mark, talk a little bit more about where that that whole thing is. It's not like the main feature of your book about the NFL, but it's certainly...LEIBOVICH: It intervened.MARTIN: ...Bubbling under the...LEIBOVICH: Oh, there's no question.MARTIN: It's infused...LEIBOVICH: Well...MARTIN: Right?LEIBOVICH: Like, the reason I wanted to write about the National Football League is it has become the - just the great spectacle of American life. I mean, something like 48 of the top 50 top-watch shows in America every year are football games. Donald Trump became the other great spectacle of American life, the other great reality show. He's wanted to end the National Football League for years, and he just sort of belly-flopped right into the middle of this pool. And this becomes a proxy fight for whether you support Donald Trump or not.MARTIN: And is this still, do you think - you know, it's interesting because at one point, hundreds of NFL players were kneeling, and then it became very fraught and complicated. Even some of the owners - one owner, let's say...LEIBOVICH: Right.MARTIN: One owner at one point knelt with his team.LEIBOVICH: Right - for one week.MARTIN: But has it - has that - is this - is that controversy - so we're going to talk about the entertainers in a minute.LEIBOVICH: Yeah.MARTIN: But is it still something that is very present for the league?LEIBOVICH: It's present in that Colin Kaepernick does not have a job, and people are acutely aware of that. But no, protest has not been a big story this year. Donald Trump has essentially laid off, and he was occupied on the midterms and the shutdown and so forth. So - but it's very much beneath the surface. And, again, the Colin Kaepernick situation is something that a lot of people who are outside the league are very quick to weigh in on, musical acts being a great example here.MARTIN: Megan, can I just ask you briefly about this? But not to belabor the point, but could you just address Rodney's point for a minute? I mean, Rodney's point is that, you know, the idea that some people get to have a safe place where they cannot think about the broader issues in their lives is something that some people never had. I mean, they're going back to - you know, how many - it was a great writer who said, you know, what is the fourth of July to the Negro? And did you see my point? So...MCARDLE: Absolutely. No, look, I think that's an absolutely valid point. And I think there's kind of two questions you have to separate in that. And one is, does the country need places where it can come together on a non-political footing? And I would say it does. I'm not going to tell a player protesting police brutality no, right? I'm not going to say that. I'm just saying, like, it is sad to watch all of those spaces collapsing at once, and it is sad that the NFL is one of them. I'm not saying that, you know, I therefore think Colin Kaepernick did something wrong or that the players did something wrong.I think the second question, which is a different question, is, tactically, does this advance your cause?

(Matt Rourke/AP Photo)In response to a state mandate, Philadelphia is replacing its voting machines – all 3,735 of them – before the general election on Nov. 5.The city commissioners Wednesday picked Omaha-based Election Systems & Software to do the job at a cost of $50 million.“It’s a huge expense for a city, but the governor asked all the counties in Pennsylvania to get new voting systems in place, and the county of Philadelphia is doing what the governor asked, ” said Lisa Deeley, commission chairwoman, after the vote.The new digital system resembles the current one. Voting machines will still have a “full-face” display, meaning every candidate in every race will appear on one electronic screen.But there are two big differences. The machines will provide a paper record of each individual vote, a requirement of the state mandate aimed at halting voter fraud and hacking. Poll books – which are used to check voters in before they cast their ballots – will also be electronic, not paper-based.“These systems, all the systems, had to go through vigorous certification, both on the federal and state level before we could even consider them,” Deeley said. “It wasn’t like we went to Crazy Eddie’s voting machine store.”The machines will cost the city $27 million up front. The rest of the money is needed to cover the poll books, a new storage warehouse, as well as maintenance and training poll workers and city employees.Wednesday’s decision didn’t sit well with everyone, including City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart, who called the process of choosing a voting machine vendor “troubling” and “deeply flawed.”The city’s request for proposals, said Rhynhart, was written to favor Election Systems & Software, the country’s largest manufacturer of voting machines.The sentiment was echoed by residents who spoke before the vote. They also said the new system is too expensive. Only $22 million has been earmarked for the upgrade in the city’s next capital budget.“I don’t want to see $20 million extra disappear into the pockets of some company when it could be spent on increasing the pay for poll workers, it could be spent on improving access to the polls for disabled people, it could be spent on our schools,” said Rich Garella, a member of Citizens for Better Elections. “Anything but this.”Pennsylvania’s directive to install new voting systems was based on concerns that many of the aging machines are difficult to double-check in the event an election’s integrity is questioned.The commitment became binding months later, when the commonwealth settled a 2016 lawsuit with Jill Stein’s presidential campaign that alleged the old machines weren’t reliable and made recounts difficult. State officials didn’t admit any fault, but their settlement with Stein included a pledge to update the machines by 2020.The undertaking is expected to cost counties about $125 million.On Wednesday, Republican lawmakers on the Senate’s Appropriations Committee let officials from the Department of State know that they’re not totally happy with the arrangement.Sen. Bob Mensch, R-Berks, said the upgrades are unnecessary.“We have a rush to 2020,” he said. “We have a huge expense to our taxpayers.

And we have no example, none, of a real, legitimate issue.”Wolf has said he wants the state to put $75 million toward the project over five years — an amount some county officials have said is not enough.Meanwhile, Deeley said there’s been “some talk” of Philadelphia receiving additional state – and possibly federal – funds to help close the expected funding gap for the new system.WITF’s Katie Meyer contributed to this report.

Recipients included House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Gov. Gina Raimondo and former lieutenant governor candidate Aaron Regunberg, all Democrats. When donors give more than a certain amount, they have to say where they work, an important transparency measure so the public can see who is trying to influence policy. In a series of donations from 2014 to 2018 in Board of Elections records, the public didn’t have a chance: Donations from people involved in strip clubs listed their employer as the Goldberg Law Offices. Firm principal Robert D. Goldberg lobbied for the Rhode Island Entertainment Association, made up of leaders from various strip clubs in the state, until 2015. Goldberg said he did not know why the contributions listed his firm as the employer of the people involved in the strip-club industry, and that it “has never been my practice to bundle political donations.” Donors listed in campaign finance records as working for Goldberg’s lobby shop included the owner and the president of Club Desire, the owner and managers of the Foxy Lady, and employees of the Cadillac Lounge. Mattiello was the first to receive the donations in question. He said the donors had “evidently” provided incorrect information to his campaign in 2014. Bell, of the Rhode Island Republican Party, didn’t buy it.",325,305

(Jose Luis Magana/AP)Abortion foes are one group standing enthusiastically with President Trump as he seeks reelection next year, delighted the president has prioritized their cause over his two years in office and freshly invigorated by his eagerness to describe abortion in strong terms and call for its end.Trump has gone after abortion providers and access to the procedure through agency regulations, judicial appointments and budget requests. He most recently used strong language to describe Virginia and New York measures making it easier to obtain abortions late in pregnancy, calling on Congress to pass antiabortion legislation and even personally confronting Democrats over the issue.Any day now, the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to finalize a rule representing its latest effort to crack down on abortion providers. Under the proposed regulation, abortion providers couldn’t receive federal family-planning dollars — a move that could cost Planned Parenthood, which serves 41 percent of the 4 million patients getting care under the Title X program, as much as $60 million a year.And late yesterday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) moved forward on legislation extending protections to infants born alive after an attempted abortion, scheduling a Feb. 25 vote on the measure sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.).From Sasse: From National Right to Life:Earlier in the day, the president and aides met with top antiabortion leader Marjorie Dannenfelser and several other activists who call themselves ""abortion survivors."" On a call with reporters, Dannenfelser described Trump as “the most pro-life-acting president who has ever been.”“I can say walking out of that Oval Office today, this is a deeply-held conviction,” Dannenfelser said. “Yes, it is a politically smart move he’s made in advancing human rights in this way. But it’s also the right thing to do.”The wrangling over abortion rights — how late into pregnancy the procedure should be allowed and under what circumstances — is an issue that divides the two parties more than ever before and could play a sizable role in the 2020 presidential and congressional elections as Trump seeks to hold the White House, Republicans face some tough races in the Senate and Democrats defend their new House majority.With assurances of support from Trump, Republicans have been pushing the “Born-Alive Infant Protection Act” as a way of drawing attention to late-term abortions, after confusing and controversial remarks by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D). The bill, sponsored by Sasse says an infant “born alive at any stage of development” is a person under federal law and clarifies the care they must receive.Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) blocked an earlier GOP attempt to pass the legislation by unanimous consent, arguing that U.S. laws already prohibit infanticide. This latest effort will require 60 votes to hold a vote on the measure itself, making it unlikely Republicans will succeed in advancing it. House Democratic leaders have refused to bring a similar bill to the floor.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on a vote in the House:It’s certainly a strange world in which a president who once described himself as “very pro-choice” is now a source of deep frustration for abortion rights advocates.They looked on in chagrin as his administration reinstated the “Mexico City” policy (banning foreign nongovernmental organizations who get U.S. family-planning assistance from performing or promoting abortions), made it easier for employers to refuse to cover birth control for workers and nominated two Supreme Court justices who recently sided with allowing a restrictive Louisiana abortion law to go into effect.They also protested yesterday as the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general. Barr has said little recently about abortion rights, but advocates have pointed to comments he made in the early 1990s that the Roe v. Wade case that established the right to an abortion will “ultimately be overturned.”“[Barr’s] appointment only helps to further the Trump administration’s relentless campaign against women’s essential reproductive rights,” said Adrienne Kimmell, vice president of communications for NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Barr’s confirmation is Trump’s latest move to use his administration as a weapon against women and our most fundamental right to control our own bodies and decide our own destinies.”Packs of cigarettes are seen in a store in Brunswick, Maine. (Pat Wellenbach/AP)AHH: The disparities in cancer deaths between black and white Americans have narrowed markedly in the last several years and have disappeared completely for a few age groups, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports, citing a new study by the American Cancer Society.  While African Americans still have the highest death rate and lowest survival rate among any racial or ethnic group for most cancers, the overall cancer mortality rate for blacks has decreased faster than for whites because of major declines in common cancers, including lung, prostate and colorectal cancer.“The message is progress has been made, but we still have a long way to go,” Len Lichtenfeld, interim chief medical officer for the cancer society told Laurie.The racial disparity in mortality rate has disappeared for men under 50 and women 70 and older, she reports.Lichtenfeld told Laurie the Affordable Care Act may have “made a difference” by expanding health coverage but said it was too soon to know the effect the ACA had on the most recent changes. (iStock)OOF: The American Society of Breast Surgeons is now recommending that all breast cancer patients get genetic testing to check for inherited mutations, Laurie reports.The recommendations the group sent to its 3,400 members have fueled a debate on how genetic testing should be used in disease prevention and treatment.“Too many patients develop cancers that might have been prevented or found earlier if genetic testing had been performed,” Walton Taylor, a Texas breast surgeon who is president of the group, told our colleague.“More than 266,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed in the United States every year,” Laurie reports. “Under the surgeons’ recommendation, almost all those patients would be tested, as would family members whose relatives discover they have mutations, said Taylor. It’s not clear how many people are being tested now, but experts said it is far fewer than what the recommendation contemplates.”But Taylor also said the group wasn’t trying to create controversy with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which makes recommendations that are closely followed by doctors and insurers, Laurie reports. Although the NCCN does endorse testing for inherited mutations for patients at a certain age with family histories of disease, it does not ""endorse universal testing for breast cancer patients.”An influenza vaccination is prepared for a patient at a CVS Pharmacy store's MinuteClinic in Miami. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)OUCH: There’s some good news and bad news in the preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on this season’s flu vaccines. The vaccine reduced the need to go to the doctor by nearly half, and this year’s vaccine works better overall and is more effective in children. But as many as 15,900 people may have died this season of the flu, despite a relatively mild season, our Post colleague Lena H. Sun reports. Another notable downside: The vaccine hasn’t shown any measurable protection for older adults, Lena writes. There was only an 8 percent reduction in the need to go to the doctor for the flu.“This is the first time agency officials are providing overall illness and death estimates while flu season is still underway. In the past, these estimates were calculated when the season was over,” Lena reports. “So far this winter, preliminary figures estimate that influenza infection has sickened between 13 million and 15 million people, sent between 6 million and 7 million people to the doctor, hospitalized 155,00 to 186,000, and killed 9,600 to 15,900.”President Trump.  (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)— President Trump is in “good health,” and has not seen major changes to his health status, his doctor said in a memo released by the White House. Still, Trump gained four pounds over the last year, and the president’s new weight puts his body mass index over 30, which means he’s officially considered obese, our Post colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Carolyn Y. Johnson report. The memo is the result of the president’s four-hour long physical exam that involved 11 specialists last week.“After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the President remains in very good health overall,” Trump’s doctor, Sean P. Conley, wrote.Trump, who is 72 and 6-foot-3 , weighs 243 pounds, up from 239 pounds last year, and was told to watch his diet and exercise and to lose weight. His heart rate was at 70 beats per minute and his blood pressure at 118/80 mmHg.“Conley’s language about Trump — ‘very good health overall’— was less effusive than the language used last year by Trump’s former doctor, Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson,” who referred to him as in “excellent” health, noting he was “very healthy” and had “good genes,” Toluse and Carolyn write.Bouquets are placed at a memorial on the first anniversary of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Skipper/Reuters)— On the anniversary of the shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed 17 lives, the White House released a statement from the president offering his condolences and referring to “tremendous strides” the administration has made toward protecting students from school violence. But no mention was made of addressing gun violence, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports, “except for his administration’s ban on bump stocks.” Instead, at the end of the statement, the president said he and first lady Melania Trump “join all Americans in praying for the continued healing of those in the Parkland community and all communities where lives have been lost to gun violence.”That singular message referring to gun violence was altered hours later when the president tweeted out an image of his statement in which “gun violence” was changed to “school violence,” in a move Colby writes is a “bizarre and telling tweak.”“But despite the president’s resistance to strengthening the nation’s gun-control laws and the continued intransigence on the issue among Republicans, there’s a sense that the tide is shifting,” she writes. The House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill Wednesday to strengthen the country’s gun-control laws, a measure with five Republican co-sponsors that was notably the eighth bill introduced this year.An Obamacare sign being displayed on the storefront of an insurance agency in Hialeah, Fla.  (AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File)— A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday to allow Democratic lawmakers to intervene and defend the Affordable Care Act in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the law . But the court rejected a request from Democratic states to expedite an appeal of a lower court’s ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional, the Hill’s Lydia Wheeler and Jessie Hellmann report.In January, the House asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to join an appeal by a group of Democratic attorneys general against the December ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor that the ACA is invalid. In its motion, the House argued, ""federal law provides that the Attorney General has a right to intervene in litigation to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, and it empowers the House and/or the Senate to intervene to defend a statute on the rare occasions in which the Attorney General fails to do so.""“Though [Judge Leslie Southwick] called the House’s argument questionable, he said a ruling on whether the House has a right under federal law to intervene in the case is unnecessary,” Lydia and Jessie write.“In the absence of any other federal governmental party in the case presenting a complete defense to the Congressional enactment at issue, this court may benefit from the participation by the House,” Southwick said. “In the context of this case, the motion to intervene was not untimely. Further, intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the rights of the original parties.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)— Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) sent a letter to a pair of top tech companies calling on them to do more to address the anti-vaccination messages spreading through their platforms. “As a Member of Congress who is deeply concerned about declining vaccination rates, I am requesting additional information on the steps that you currently take to provide medically accurate information on vaccinations to your users, and to encourage you to consider additional steps you can take to address this growing problem,” Schiff wrote to Facebook and Google chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai.The letter also praised YouTube for announcing it will “no longer recommend videos that violate its community guidelines, such as conspiracy theories or medically inaccurate videos, and encourage further action to be taken related to vaccine misinformation.”Our Post colleague Taylor Telford wrote this week about how Facebook is looking to tackle the challenge of vaccination misinformation on its platform. “The company is considering options to make accurate information about vaccinations more accessible to users, but these efforts are in the early stages,” Taylor wrote. “In the meantime, Facebook sees factually accurate counter-speech by users as a possible safeguard.”— And here are a few more good reads: TodayIgnore the spin.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)— President Trump is in “good health,” and has not seen major changes to his health status, his doctor said in a memo released by the White House. Still, Trump gained four pounds over the last year, and the president’s new weight puts his body mass index over 30, which means he’s officially considered obese, our Post colleagues Toluse Olorunnipa and Carolyn Y. Johnson report. The memo is the result of the president’s four-hour long physical exam that involved 11 specialists last week.“After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the President remains in very good health overall,” Trump’s doctor, Sean P. Conley, wrote.Trump, who is 72 and 6-foot-3 , weighs 243 pounds, up from 239 pounds last year, and was told to watch his diet and exercise and to lose weight. His heart rate was at 70 beats per minute and his blood pressure at 118/80 mmHg.“Conley’s language about Trump — ‘very good health overall’— was less effusive than the language used last year by Trump’s former doctor, Navy Rear Adm. Ronny L. Jackson,” who referred to him as in “excellent” health, noting he was “very healthy” and had “good genes,” Toluse and Carolyn write.Bouquets are placed at a memorial on the first anniversary of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (Joe Skipper/Reuters)— On the anniversary of the shooting at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed 17 lives, the White House released a statement from the president offering his condolences and referring to “tremendous strides” the administration has made toward protecting students from school violence. But no mention was made of addressing gun violence, our Post colleague Colby Itkowitz reports, “except for his administration’s ban on bump stocks.” Instead, at the end of the statement, the president said he and first lady Melania Trump “join all Americans in praying for the continued healing of those in the Parkland community and all communities where lives have been lost to gun violence.”That singular message referring to gun violence was altered hours later when the president tweeted out an image of his statement in which “gun violence” was changed to “school violence,” in a move Colby writes is a “bizarre and telling tweak.”“But despite the president’s resistance to strengthening the nation’s gun-control laws and the continued intransigence on the issue among Republicans, there’s a sense that the tide is shifting,” she writes. The House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill Wednesday to strengthen the country’s gun-control laws, a measure with five Republican co-sponsors that was notably the eighth bill introduced this year.An Obamacare sign being displayed on the storefront of an insurance agency in Hialeah, Fla.  (AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File)— A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday to allow Democratic lawmakers to intervene and defend the Affordable Care Act in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the law . But the court rejected a request from Democratic states to expedite an appeal of a lower court’s ruling that the ACA is unconstitutional, the Hill’s Lydia Wheeler and Jessie Hellmann report.In January, the House asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to join an appeal by a group of Democratic attorneys general against the December ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor that the ACA is invalid. In its motion, the House argued, ""federal law provides that the Attorney General has a right to intervene in litigation to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress, and it empowers the House and/or the Senate to intervene to defend a statute on the rare occasions in which the Attorney General fails to do so.""“Though [Judge Leslie Southwick] called the House’s argument questionable, he said a ruling on whether the House has a right under federal law to intervene in the case is unnecessary,” Lydia and Jessie write.“In the absence of any other federal governmental party in the case presenting a complete defense to the Congressional enactment at issue, this court may benefit from the participation by the House,” Southwick said. “In the context of this case, the motion to intervene was not untimely. Further, intervention will not unduly delay or prejudice the rights of the original parties.”Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.). (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)— Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) sent a letter to a pair of top tech companies calling on them to do more to address the anti-vaccination messages spreading through their platforms. “As a Member of Congress who is deeply concerned about declining vaccination rates, I am requesting additional information on the steps that you currently take to provide medically accurate information on vaccinations to your users, and to encourage you to consider additional steps you can take to address this growing problem,” Schiff wrote to Facebook and Google chief executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai.The letter also praised YouTube for announcing it will “no longer recommend videos that violate its community guidelines, such as conspiracy theories or medically inaccurate videos, and encourage further action to be taken related to vaccine misinformation.”Our Post colleague Taylor Telford wrote this week about how Facebook is looking to tackle the challenge of vaccination misinformation on its platform. “The company is considering options to make accurate information about vaccinations more accessible to users, but these efforts are in the early stages,” Taylor wrote. “In the meantime, Facebook sees factually accurate counter-speech by users as a possible safeguard.”— And here are a few more good reads: TodayIgnore the spin.

46,Drug Use in Sports,Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?,1s46q10r,https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wnny9m/the-case-for-steroids,The Uneasy Case for Steroids - Motherboard,"When baseball writers cast their votes for the baseball Hall of Fame this year, they failed to elect a single player—the first time that has happened since 1996, according to ESPN, and just the second time in four decades. Among the list of rejected players were absolute titans of the game, including Roger Clemens, the league’s only seven-time Cy Young award winner, and Barry Bonds, the league’s only seven-time MVP and owner of baseball’s single-season and career home run records. Sammy Sosa hit 609 career home runs—eight on the all time list. He, too, failed to make the cut. The common denominator? Steroids and performance-enhancing drugs. Neither Bonds, Clemens, nor Sosa has admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), though all three have gotten in hot water legally and publicly over the last decade during steroid-related court proceedings. A player needs to earn votes by 75 percent of members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America to make the Hall of Fame, but none of the three, each among the most accomplished players of all time, even cracked 40 percent. (Sosa, who according to a New York Times report in 2009, tested positive in 2003 for PEDs, received a mere 12.5 percent.) Other PED-related scandals have plagued baseball in recent months, but isn’t the only sport implicated. Lance Armstrong may be the most famous alleged doper in the world right now. Following the release last fall of damning evidence by anti-doping officials that he was juicing, Armstrong was banned for life from competing in Olympic sports and stripped of his seven Tour de France Titles. (What is it with 7, anyway?) Reports say he is considering admitting to doping publicly in hopes of restoring his eligibility—perhaps during his interview with Oprah, airing Jan. 17. But even Oprah’s numinous, redemptive powers won’t get Lance his medals back. Still, a funny thing happened on the way to the crucifixion. For all the finger-wagging against PED use, a counter-argument is emerging. Steroids and PEDs, it says, should be legalized. Or at least de-stigmatized. “This fake moral outrage about the ‘disgraceful state of competitive sports nowadays’ that serves as a running dialogue every time an athlete is busted for steroids is just about played out,” wrote sports columnist, Jen Floyd Engel, for Fox Sports, in August. “The fact is almost every single argument against performance-enhancing drugs falters when viewed in light of how we live the rest of our lives.” Whether that’s true or not, Engel isn’t alone. Secretive, even cautious at first, the pro-steroid argument is growing in confidence, and in prominence. The potential risks of PEDs are well documented. According to doctors at the Mayo Clinic, PEDs may cause everything from shrunken testicles to severe acne to cardiomyopathy, as well as liver problems, heart attacks, stroke, enlarged prostates and a number of psychiatric disorders. Still, all sports carry risk, as we’ve seen from football and hockey concussions, not to mention the deaths of racecar drivers like IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon, or NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt. For that and other reasons, Forbes sports writer, Chris Smith, says steroids in professional sports should be legalized. One of his main arguments is that PED use is already so pervasive and hard to prosecute that it’s hamstringing athletes who follow the rules and hamstringing the potential greatness of sport more generally. “Various professional sports leagues have attempted to set a level playing field by testing for drug use and suspending those found guilty,” he writes. It’s a noble effort, but it’s clearly not working. Stiff punishments have done little to reduce the number of cyclists caught cheating every year; as Deadspin helpfully points out, the inheritors of Lance Armstrong’s seven abandoned Tour de France titles have all been implicated in doping scandals. Major League Baseball also hands down suspensions each season to players caught using outlawed substances, and it’s absurd to think those players are the only ones guilty of juicing. If we legalized PED’s, he continues, Not only would the playing field suddenly be even for all players, it would be at a higher level. A huge part of watching sports is witnessing the very peak of human athletic ability, and legalizing performance enhancing drugs would only help athletes climb even higher. Steroids and doping will help pitchers to throw harder, home runs to go further, cyclists to charge for longer and sprinters to test the very limits of human speed. The notion that clean sports even exist, the argument goes, is a sham: “Get rid of drug testing,” said Charles Yesalis, a professor of health policy and administration, Exercise, and sport science, in an interview with Fox Sports. “Do you really think we had a clean Olympics? All testing does is to continue to perpetuate the myth that sports are clean.” Another myth, apparently, is the notion that steroids are bad for you. “You see all these reports that steroids cause heart disease, cancer, strokes and so on,” said Dr. Norman Fost, a professor of bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, in one of the Fox Sports articles cited above. “Then it gets repeated over and over again. There is not a single study out there that proves steroids cause any of these diseases.” “Therapeutic use of testosterone has been shown to be safe,” sportswriter A.J. Perez notes. A 1996 paper on use of synthetic testosterone published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed notable gains in strength with no major side effects other than a handful of cases of breast tenderness and increased acne among the 40 men ages 19-40 who completed the study. Still, the problem with athlete doping, as Perez concedes, is that so many athletes use at extreme levels—way higher than in the 1996 study. High steroid use can’t be tested accurately in a lab setting because it’s simply unethical: ""To study the use of steroids at the levels athletes currently use them is not going to happen,” said [Dr. Gary] Wadler, a New York internist who is a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) prohibited list and methods subcommittee. “We don’t allow people to take things that will hurt themselves (in studies). We can’t tell athletes to take doping doses of steroids over a long period of time just to see how many get sick and die. No institutional review board would allow that study to take place.” Some athletes and other steroid users insist, however, that they can be taken safely. In a Reason magazine article from 2005 titled, “In Defense of Steroids,” author Aaron Steinberg examined a few arguments from Jose Canseco’s autobiography, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big. According to Canseco, the only negative side effect he suffered was a set of shrunken balls. The benefits, on the other hand, were myriad: Most people assume that steroids are only useful for building thick layers of muscle and cranking home runs. As Canseco tells it, though, steroids and human growth hormone can be put to much more sophisticated use. If taken in moderate doses and in certain combinations over a period of time, they can help build strength, quickness, and, most importantly, stamina. The baseball season--a 162-game slog--goes from the beginning of April to the end of September (barring a postseason run). Most players wear out at some point during that period. If a power hitter can use steroids to stay fresh over the course of a season, he could pound out a few extra home runs before October--and that's without any gain in bulk. With millions of dollars at stake, it only makes sense that players would look into this seriously. The sports press has been quick to diagnose him with steroid-induced fragility, but Canseco insists that steroids helped him cut down on trips to the disabled list and to recover faster when he was hurt. In his book, Canseco characterizes himself as a scrawny, injury-prone kid who started experimenting with steroids in the minor leagues, just prior to his rapid ascent into the majors. Canseco claims that he began to spike his workouts with liquid testosterone combined with Deca Derbol in 1985. That year he shot from a double-A team in Huntsville, Alabama, to the major leagues. The next season he won Rookie of the Year, and two seasons after that, he was Most Valuable Player. The steroids-are-safe argument is one of the reasons steroid proponents trumpet another, more popular sentiment: Strict anti-steroid-ism is morally specious and hypocritical. Like criminalizing marijunana over alcohol, it’s an arbitrary attack, some say. It’s an assault on freedom and even masculinity. As with any subversive group—from conspiracy theorists to anarchists to white power assholes—proponents of steroid and PED use have found fertile ground for their ideas in the dark alleyways and safe houses of the internet. Here, the arguments can get a bit gnarly. The world of pro-steroid websites and user forums can be a strange, even scary place—an enabling, often uncritical echo chamber, reminiscent of “pro-ana” and “pro-mia” websites that give refuge and “thinspiration” to anorexics and bulimics. (“Pro Mia is the belief that bulimia is a life style,” reads the tagline to one such popular website. “…it means we choose NOT to go into recovery at this time.”) Pro-steroid discussion threads commonly emerge on run-of-the-mill body-building sites. Meanwhile, some websites are dedicated entirely to the pro-steroid cause. The latter are clearinghouses of articles purporting to tell the truth about steroids. They tell people where to get steroids and offer advice on the most effective regimens. They share tips on how to mitigate side effects like hair-loss and acne, and attack the “muscle-hating psychology,” “hysteria,” and “hypocrisy” of an anti-steroid society at large that, in the words of one writer, “often pretends to be about something more than enforcing an arbitrarily and capriciously defined morality.” In reality, the writer continues, that society creates rules that “exist primarily to demonize users of steroids and PEDs as ‘sinners’ who deserve to be punished.” Forum discussions can get a bit persecuted, paranoid, and, yes, a little aggro. “Seriously, I think there's an agenda,” writes “Grizzly” in a forum that boasts nearly 7,000 active users and more than 34,000 members. “I think the demasculization of society is at the heart of all women.” “Accept it or fuck off!” writes another user about his steroid regimen. “Its almost like a bunch of angry house wifes sat around one afternoon and said, ‘Well, we can vote now, and I still feel angry and bitter... what else can we fuck with?’” writes another. “Sexual discimination at its uttmost, it is all designed to keep you down boy,” writes a veteran member. “Get down, bend over and let the world do with you what it wants” (sic, sic, and sic throughout). Still, less fringe- and cringe-worthy arguments picking apart the moral positioning of anti-steroid advocates are out there. We already love fakeness, they say. We’re hypocrites. “To say that we should reduce drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability,” said Julian Savulescu, professor of practical ethics at the University of Oxford, in a 2008 debate moderated by sportscaster, Bob Costas. “Performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport,” he added, “it's been a part of sport through its whole history, and to be human is to be better, or at least to try to be better.” Dr. Fost participated in the same debate. “Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes ... infertility,” he said. “But sport itself is far more dangerous, and we don't prohibit it. The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are 50 to 100 times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids. More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use.” Indeed a lot of things we do and condone are more dangerous than steroids, the argument proceeds—and just as dishonest. “We love fake,” Engel, the Fox Sports columnist, notes. “Facebook ‘friends,’ Twinkies and double Ds not endowed by our creator.” We love short cuts. Weight-loss surgery, no-fault divorce and CliffsNotes. We love lies, too. Living in houses we cannot afford, living with debt we cannot handle and arguing — not unlike, say, Brady Anderson — this is all a result of hard work. So where exactly does the moral authority to sermonize on the horror that is steroids in sports come from? Isolated to sports, athletes use plenty of other means that are “unnatural” to enhance their performance, others note. “If the andro that helped [baseball player, Mark] McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998 was an unnatural, game-altering enhancement, what about his high-powered contact lenses?” wrote William Saletan in a 2005 article for Slate… “Natural” vision is 20/20. McGwire's custom-designed lenses improved his vision to 20/10, which means he could see at a distance of 20 feet what a person with normal, healthy vision could see at 10 feet. Think what a difference that makes in hitting a fastball. Imagine how many games those lenses altered. It’s at least conceivable that, in keeping with the argument used for legalizing other drugs, or for keeping guns legal, that by getting it out in the open, we can at least do a better job of regulating it and stemming abuse. Until then, I’ll still tread lightly around the dead lifters at the gym.Sign up for Motherboard Premium.",1,10,Pro,Pro,Neutral,0,Pro,"['Pro', 'Pro', 'Neutral']","Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?

Or at least de-stigmatized. “This fake moral outrage about the ‘disgraceful state of competitive sports nowadays’ that serves as a running dialogue every time an athlete is busted for steroids is just about played out,” wrote sports columnist, Jen Floyd Engel, for Fox Sports, in August. “The fact is almost every single argument against performance-enhancing drugs falters when viewed in light of how we live the rest of our lives.” Whether that’s true or not, Engel isn’t alone. Secretive, even cautious at first, the pro-steroid argument is growing in confidence, and in prominence. The potential risks of PEDs are well documented. According to doctors at the Mayo Clinic, PEDs may cause everything from shrunken testicles to severe acne to cardiomyopathy, as well as liver problems, heart attacks, stroke, enlarged prostates and a number of psychiatric disorders. Still, all sports carry risk, as we’ve seen from football and hockey concussions, not to mention the deaths of racecar drivers like IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon, or NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardt. For that and other reasons, Forbes sports writer, Chris Smith, says steroids in professional sports should be legalized. One of his main arguments is that PED use is already so pervasive and hard to prosecute that it’s hamstringing athletes who follow the rules and hamstringing the potential greatness of sport more generally. “Various professional sports leagues have attempted to set a level playing field by testing for drug use and suspending those found guilty,” he writes. It’s a noble effort, but it’s clearly not working. Stiff punishments have done little to reduce the number of cyclists caught cheating every year; as Deadspin helpfully points out, the inheritors of Lance Armstrong’s seven abandoned Tour de France titles have all been implicated in doping scandals. Major League Baseball also hands down suspensions each season to players caught using outlawed substances, and it’s absurd to think those players are the only ones guilty of juicing. If we legalized PED’s, he continues, Not only would the playing field suddenly be even for all players, it would be at a higher level. A huge part of watching sports is witnessing the very peak of human athletic ability, and legalizing performance enhancing drugs would only help athletes climb even higher. Steroids and doping will help pitchers to throw harder, home runs to go further, cyclists to charge for longer and sprinters to test the very limits of human speed. The notion that clean sports even exist, the argument goes, is a sham: “Get rid of drug testing,” said Charles Yesalis, a professor of health policy and administration, Exercise, and sport science, in an interview with Fox Sports. “Do you really think we had a clean Olympics? All testing does is to continue to perpetuate the myth that sports are clean.” Another myth, apparently, is the notion that steroids are bad for you. “You see all these reports that steroids cause heart disease, cancer, strokes and so on,” said Dr. Norman Fost, a professor of bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, in one of the Fox Sports articles cited above. “Then it gets repeated over and over again. There is not a single study out there that proves steroids cause any of these diseases.” “Therapeutic use of testosterone has been shown to be safe,” sportswriter A.J. Perez notes. A 1996 paper on use of synthetic testosterone published in The New England Journal of Medicine showed notable gains in strength with no major side effects other than a handful of cases of breast tenderness and increased acne among the 40 men ages 19-40 who completed the study. Still, the problem with athlete doping, as Perez concedes, is that so many athletes use at extreme levels—way higher than in the 1996 study. High steroid use can’t be tested accurately in a lab setting because it’s simply unethical: ""To study the use of steroids at the levels athletes currently use them is not going to happen,” said [Dr. Gary] Wadler, a New York internist who is a former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) prohibited list and methods subcommittee. “We don’t allow people to take things that will hurt themselves (in studies). We can’t tell athletes to take doping doses of steroids over a long period of time just to see how many get sick and die. No institutional review board would allow that study to take place.” Some athletes and other steroid users insist, however, that they can be taken safely. In a Reason magazine article from 2005 titled, “In Defense of Steroids,” author Aaron Steinberg examined a few arguments from Jose Canseco’s autobiography, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big. According to Canseco, the only negative side effect he suffered was a set of shrunken balls. The benefits, on the other hand, were myriad: Most people assume that steroids are only useful for building thick layers of muscle and cranking home runs. As Canseco tells it, though, steroids and human growth hormone can be put to much more sophisticated use. If taken in moderate doses and in certain combinations over a period of time, they can help build strength, quickness, and, most importantly, stamina. The baseball season--a 162-game slog--goes from the beginning of April to the end of September (barring a postseason run). Most players wear out at some point during that period. If a power hitter can use steroids to stay fresh over the course of a season, he could pound out a few extra home runs before October--and that's without any gain in bulk. With millions of dollars at stake, it only makes sense that players would look into this seriously. The sports press has been quick to diagnose him with steroid-induced fragility, but Canseco insists that steroids helped him cut down on trips to the disabled list and to recover faster when he was hurt. In his book, Canseco characterizes himself as a scrawny, injury-prone kid who started experimenting with steroids in the minor leagues, just prior to his rapid ascent into the majors. Canseco claims that he began to spike his workouts with liquid testosterone combined with Deca Derbol in 1985. That year he shot from a double-A team in Huntsville, Alabama, to the major leagues. The next season he won Rookie of the Year, and two seasons after that, he was Most Valuable Player. The steroids-are-safe argument is one of the reasons steroid proponents trumpet another, more popular sentiment: Strict anti-steroid-ism is morally specious and hypocritical. Like criminalizing marijunana over alcohol, it’s an arbitrary attack, some say. It’s an assault on freedom and even masculinity. As with any subversive group—from conspiracy theorists to anarchists to white power assholes—proponents of steroid and PED use have found fertile ground for their ideas in the dark alleyways and safe houses of the internet. Here, the arguments can get a bit gnarly. The world of pro-steroid websites and user forums can be a strange, even scary place—an enabling, often uncritical echo chamber, reminiscent of “pro-ana” and “pro-mia” websites that give refuge and “thinspiration” to anorexics and bulimics. (“Pro Mia is the belief that bulimia is a life style,” reads the tagline to one such popular website. “…it means we choose NOT to go into recovery at this time.”) Pro-steroid discussion threads commonly emerge on run-of-the-mill body-building sites. Meanwhile, some websites are dedicated entirely to the pro-steroid cause. The latter are clearinghouses of articles purporting to tell the truth about steroids. They tell people where to get steroids and offer advice on the most effective regimens. They share tips on how to mitigate side effects like hair-loss and acne, and attack the “muscle-hating psychology,” “hysteria,” and “hypocrisy” of an anti-steroid society at large that, in the words of one writer, “often pretends to be about something more than enforcing an arbitrarily and capriciously defined morality.” In reality, the writer continues, that society creates rules that “exist primarily to demonize users of steroids and PEDs as ‘sinners’ who deserve to be punished.” Forum discussions can get a bit persecuted, paranoid, and, yes, a little aggro. “Seriously, I think there's an agenda,” writes “Grizzly” in a forum that boasts nearly 7,000 active users and more than 34,000 members. “I think the demasculization of society is at the heart of all women.” “Accept it or fuck off!” writes another user about his steroid regimen. “Its almost like a bunch of angry house wifes sat around one afternoon and said, ‘Well, we can vote now, and I still feel angry and bitter... what else can we fuck with?’” writes another. “Sexual discimination at its uttmost, it is all designed to keep you down boy,” writes a veteran member. “Get down, bend over and let the world do with you what it wants” (sic, sic, and sic throughout). Still, less fringe- and cringe-worthy arguments picking apart the moral positioning of anti-steroid advocates are out there. We already love fakeness, they say. We’re hypocrites. “To say that we should reduce drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance, is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability,” said Julian Savulescu, professor of practical ethics at the University of Oxford, in a 2008 debate moderated by sportscaster, Bob Costas. “Performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport,” he added, “it's been a part of sport through its whole history, and to be human is to be better, or at least to try to be better.” Dr. Fost participated in the same debate. “Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects: acne, baldness, voice changes ... infertility,” he said. “But sport itself is far more dangerous, and we don't prohibit it. The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are 50 to 100 times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids. More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use.” Indeed a lot of things we do and condone are more dangerous than steroids, the argument proceeds—and just as dishonest. “We love fake,” Engel, the Fox Sports columnist, notes. “Facebook ‘friends,’ Twinkies and double Ds not endowed by our creator.” We love short cuts. Weight-loss surgery, no-fault divorce and CliffsNotes. We love lies, too. Living in houses we cannot afford, living with debt we cannot handle and arguing — not unlike, say, Brady Anderson — this is all a result of hard work. So where exactly does the moral authority to sermonize on the horror that is steroids in sports come from? Isolated to sports, athletes use plenty of other means that are “unnatural” to enhance their performance, others note. “If the andro that helped [baseball player, Mark] McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998 was an unnatural, game-altering enhancement, what about his high-powered contact lenses?” wrote William Saletan in a 2005 article for Slate… “Natural” vision is 20/20. McGwire's custom-designed lenses improved his vision to 20/10, which means he could see at a distance of 20 feet what a person with normal, healthy vision could see at 10 feet. Think what a difference that makes in hitting a fastball. Imagine how many games those lenses altered. It’s at least conceivable that, in keeping with the argument used for legalizing other drugs, or for keeping guns legal, that by getting it out in the open, we can at least do a better job of regulating it and stemming abuse. Until then, I’ll still tread lightly around the dead lifters at the gym.Sign up for Motherboard Premium.",2261,2243

56,Universal Basic Income,Is Universal Basic Income a Good Idea?,2s56q3r,https://www.bbntimes.com/en/global-economy/universal-basic-income-preliminary-results-from-the-finnish-experiment,Universal Basic Income: Preliminary Results from the Finnish Experiment,"The big selling points for a universal basic income are simplicity and work incentives. The simplicity arises because with a universal basic income, there are no qualifications to satisfy or forms to fill out. People just receive it, regardless of factors like income levels or whether they have a job. There are not bureaucratic costs of determining eligibility, and no stigma of applying for such benefits or in receiving them.The gains for work incentives arise because many programs aimed at helping the poor have a built-in feature that as you earn more on the job, you receive less in government assistance. From one standpoint, this seems logical and fair. But economists have been quick to point out that if someone loses a dollar of government benefits every time they gain a dollar from working, the implicit tax rate is 100%. When there are a number of different programs aimed at the working poor, all phasing out on their own individual schedules as income rises, the result can be that low-income people face very high implicit tax rates--even in some situations close to 100%. But a universal basic income does not decline or phase out as someone earns more income.  There are plenty of assertions about how a universal basic income would affect work incentives, but actual hard evidence is still accumulating. The province of Ontario announced that it would run a three- year experiment, but then cancelled it after one year. An organization called GiveDirectly is running a universal basic income experiment in Kenya, although results aren't available yet, but there is reason to be skeptical as to whether the cost and effects of such a program in a low-income country will offer natural lessons for high-income countries. A firm called YCombinator is planning to run a universal basic income experiment in two US cities starting in 2019, but details still seem sketchy. The city of Stockton in California has just started an experiment where 130 people will get monthly payments of $500 for the next 18 months. The program in Alaska in which residents get a payment from the state based on oil royalties, typically $1000-$2000 per year, can be viewed as a form of a universal basic income, although it's clearly not enough to live on by itself. Finland has been running an experiment with a university basic income for the last couple of years, and preliminary results on work behavior are now available. The report is  ""The basic income experiment 2017–2018in Finland,"" edited by Olli Kangas, Signe Jauhiainen, Miska Simanainen, Minna Ylikännö and published by Finland's Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (February 2019). They write:""[T]he amount of basic income was 560 euros per month. This corresponded to the monthly net amount of the basic unemployment allowance and the labour market subsidy provided by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland). Two thousand persons aged 25–58 years who received an unemployment benefit from Kela in November 2016 were selected for the actual experiment. They were selected through random sampling without any regional or other emphasis. ... Despite its deficiencies, the Finnish experiment is exceptional from an international perspective in that participation in the experiment was compulsory and it was designed as a randomised field experiment."" The effects on employment during the first year of the experiment (that is in 2017) turn out to be essentially nonexistent:Of the persons who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela, 57 per cent had no earnings or income from self-employment in 2017. The figures also reveal that the average income of those who had been in employment was only around 9,920 euros. ... [T]he experiment did not have any effect on employment status during the first year of the experiment. The number of annual days in employment for the group that received a basic income is on average about half a day higher than for the control group. Overall, receipt of any positive earnings or income from self-employment, either from the open labour market or the subsidised labour market, is about one percentage point more common in the treatment group. However, resulting earnings and incomes from self-employment turned out to be 21 euros smaller.In other results based on phone surveys, those who received the universal basic income expressed greater confident in their own future, and they expressed a belief that it would be easier to accept a future job offer. It will be interesting to see if these attitudes lead to actually higher employment as the 2018 data becomes available . It's important to note that like all practical experiments, the Finnish experiment was not a completely pure universal basic income. For example, the experiment targeted the long-term unemployed, not the working poor as a group, and those receiving the benefit still dealt with the government for other support programs, like housing assistance. In adidtion, the experiment would need to be considered in the context of Finland's overall labor market. So the results are preliminary in a number of ways. But it's hard to spin them as encouraging. For those who would like a bunch of links to discussion of the Finnish experiment and broader recent discussions of a universal basic income, a useful starting point is the extended article at the Brueghel website by Catarina Midoes, ""Universal basic income and the Finnish experiment"" (February 18, 2019). For a pragmatic discussion of how a true universal basic income--that is, a payment to everyone that does not phase out regardless of income--might work in a US context, interested readers might start with Universal Basic Income: A Thought Experiment"" (July 29, 2014). If one took all the money from US (nonhealth) antipoverty programs, as well as a number of tax breaks that tend to benefit the middle-and upper-class, one could fund a universal basic income for the US of about $5800 per year.A version of this article first appeared on Conversable Economist.This isn't a left vs right issue. People need to stop thinking that way.﻿Pretty soon you are going to see that fast food restaurants have suddenly replaced a majority of their workforce with robots and AI. And rest assured, it will happen very rapidly once the tech reaches a certain level, which is already imminent. Once McDonalds has stopped hiring minimum wage employees, the trend will already be on the way in every business sector. Something like 30-50% of job opportunities will just completely cease to exist.The current economic model can't possibly stay in operation.What worries me most is none of the politicians are really talking about the situation. It's as if they want to keep us in the dark for just a little longer. So that when people finally realize what is going on, it's already too late for them to have prepared any personal safety net plans.I’m generally more conservative/libertarian but I think universal basic income could be a good idea because it at least avoids one of welfare’s biggest problems. The big problem I’m talking about is that welfare incentivizes the people on it to remain poor. If you begin make too much money then you lose your welfare. UBI doesn’t have that problem since you get it no matter what your job income is.﻿UBI will eliminate large part of the pressure of merely survival and support the need for creative expression and personality/mental care, I personally think an universal basic income will be the next big evolution in economy. And rightfully so. People who are not struggling to survive are happier, and happier people are better and more productive members of society.

In fact, the main reason for China's high trade surpluses is that with such a high savings rate, China doesn't consume either a lot of imports or domestically produced goods. A reason that China can invest so much, year after year, is that the investment is financed by high savings rates. A standard recommendation for China's economy for at least the last 15 years or so is to ""rebalance"" toward being an economy driven by domestic consumption, not by investment.A team of economists from the IMF--Longmei Zhang, Ray Brooks, Ding Ding, Haiyan Ding, Hui He, Jing Lu, and Rui Mano--discuss these issues and others in ""China’s High Savings: Drivers, Prospects, and Policies,"" written as IMF Working Paper WP/18/277 (December 11, 2018). Here's a comparison of national savings around the world in 2017. The US had national savings of 18.9% of GDP. The savings rate for the world as a whole was 26.4%. China was saving 45.8% of GDP, easily more than double the US level. And China's national savings rate is actually down a bit from when it peaked at 52% of GDP back in 2008.To get a sense of what these high rates of saving imply for the mixture of consumption and investment in an economy, consider this figure. The horizontal axis shows a country's level of consumption; the vertical axis shows its level of fixed capital investment. China is way in the upper left, with low consumption and high investment. The authors write: ""With GDP per capita in PPP terms being similar to Brazil’s, consumption per capita in China is only comparable to Nigeria. If Chinese households consumed comparably to Brazilian households, their consumption levels would be more than double."" One sometimes hears saying applied to China: ""Country rich, people poor."" The high savings rate is why it can feel that way.Government in China has not run especially large budget deficits or budget surpluses, so the mixture of household and corporate saving is what drives China's high savings rate. Corporate savings in China were quite high in the early 2000s, but as a percent of GDP are now pretty much in line with global averages. China's high savings rate thus traces to its household sector. The authors write:Household savings in China have been trending up since the early 1990s and peaked at 25 percent in 2010 and moderated slightly in recent years. Globally, household savings have been falling (from 14 percent of GDP in 1980 to about 7 percent today). The diverging trend has led to an increasing gap between China and the rest of the world. At 23 percent of GDP, today China’s household savings are 15 percentage points higher than the global average and constitute the main drivers of higher national savings in China.Why do China's households save so much? Some of the likely factors include:Low birthrates and the one-child policy meant less need to spend on children, but less ability to rely on children in retirement--and thus an incentive for more saving. This can explain perhaps half of the rise in China's household savings rate in recent decades. As China's economy shifted from state-owned to privately owned firms in the 1990s, the safety net got a lot thinner. The authors write: For example, the health care coverage of urban workers declined by 17 percentage points between 1990 and 2000. Furthermore, the average replacement rate for urban workers (pension benefits in percent of wages) dropped sharply from close to 80 percent to below 50 percent (He at al., 2017). Nationwide, individuals have been paying increasingly larger shares of healthcare expenditures out of pocket, rising from 20 percent in 1978 to a peak of 60 percent in 2000. In addition, households also began paying more for education out of their own pocket, rising from 2 percent in 1990 to 13 percent in 2001.Households saved so that they could invest in housing, both as a store of wealth and as an investment that has delivered high returns in the last 15-20 years. Up until just a few years ago, the options for making financial investments were fairly limited. Interest rates were controlled, and many people didn't have access to a wide range of other financial instruments. So if you wanted to accumulate a certain level of wealth by retirement, and your financial options paid only low interest rates, you had to save a lot. Where is China's high savings rate headed? Countries across east Asia have seen their household saving rate rise in a way similar to China, but then decline fairly rapidly. The authors write: East Asian economies experienced a rapid decline in household savings after the peak. Japan’s household savings rate peaked in 1974 at about 25 percent and has fallen to almost zero. In Korea, household savings peaked in the early 1990s at 27 percent, and are at about 15 percent today. Similarly, household savings in Taiwan POC also fell rapidly after peaking in 1993 at about 30 percent, although they stabilized a decade later at about 20 percent. Household savings in these countries or areas peaked at income levels similar to China’s, suggesting that the stage of development plays an important role in savings dynamics. In addition, microdata suggest that the decline in aggregate household savings in those countries or areas was driven by lower savings rates across all income deciles, although the drop was much more pronounced for low-income households, likely reflecting the improvement in social safety nets. With the aging population and strengthening of the social safety net, China is likely to follow the regional trend.As China's population ages, household savings rates will decline and public pressures for more spending on pensions and health care will rise. Thus, the movement to lower savings rates could be reinforced if China's government shifted its pattern of spending from investment-heavy to more consumption-heavy. Here's a figure showing public investment as a share of GDP across a number of countries. And here's a figure showing government spending on consumption-related areas like health, education, social assistance, and pensions. The red diamond shows average levels of spending in these areas as a share of GDP for OECD countries. The yellow diamonds show the average for emerging markets around the world. The blue bars show China. In a low-saving, low-investment economy like the US, it's a little hard to conceive that it's possible for savings and investment rates to be too high for a country's economic health. But that's where China has been, and shifting away from established patterns is rarely simple.A version of this article first appeared on Conversable Economist.

Universal Basic Income: Preliminary Results from the Finnish Experiment The big selling points for a universal basic income are simplicity and work incentives. The simplicity arises because with a universal basic income, there are no qualifications to satisfy or forms to fill out. People just receive it, regardless of factors like income levels or whether they have a job. There are not bureaucratic costs of determining eligibility, and no stigma of applying for such benefits or in receiving them.The gains for work incentives arise because many programs aimed at helping the poor have a built-in feature that as you earn more on the job, you receive less in government assistance. From one standpoint, this seems logical and fair. But economists have been quick to point out that if someone loses a dollar of government benefits every time they gain a dollar from working, the implicit tax rate is 100%. When there are a number of different programs aimed at the working poor, all phasing out on their own individual schedules as income rises, the result can be that low-income people face very high implicit tax rates--even in some situations close to 100%. But a universal basic income does not decline or phase out as someone earns more income.  There are plenty of assertions about how a universal basic income would affect work incentives, but actual hard evidence is still accumulating. The province of Ontario announced that it would run a three- year experiment, but then cancelled it after one year. An organization called GiveDirectly is running a universal basic income experiment in Kenya, although results aren't available yet, but there is reason to be skeptical as to whether the cost and effects of such a program in a low-income country will offer natural lessons for high-income countries. A firm called YCombinator is planning to run a universal basic income experiment in two US cities starting in 2019, but details still seem sketchy. The city of Stockton in California has just started an experiment where 130 people will get monthly payments of $500 for the next 18 months. The program in Alaska in which residents get a payment from the state based on oil royalties, typically $1000-$2000 per year, can be viewed as a form of a universal basic income, although it's clearly not enough to live on by itself. Finland has been running an experiment with a university basic income for the last couple of years, and preliminary results on work behavior are now available. The report is  ""The basic income experiment 2017–2018in Finland,"" edited by Olli Kangas, Signe Jauhiainen, Miska Simanainen, Minna Ylikännö and published by Finland's Ministry of Social Affairs and Health (February 2019). They write:""[T]he amount of basic income was 560 euros per month. This corresponded to the monthly net amount of the basic unemployment allowance and the labour market subsidy provided by Kela (the Social Insurance Institution of Finland). Two thousand persons aged 25–58 years who received an unemployment benefit from Kela in November 2016 were selected for the actual experiment. They were selected through random sampling without any regional or other emphasis. ... Despite its deficiencies, the Finnish experiment is exceptional from an international perspective in that participation in the experiment was compulsory and it was designed as a randomised field experiment."" The effects on employment during the first year of the experiment (that is in 2017) turn out to be essentially nonexistent:Of the persons who in November 2016 received an unemployment benefit from Kela, 57 per cent had no earnings or income from self-employment in 2017. The figures also reveal that the average income of those who had been in employment was only around 9,920 euros. ... [T]he experiment did not have any effect on employment status during the first year of the experiment. The number of annual days in employment for the group that received a basic income is on average about half a day higher than for the control group. Overall, receipt of any positive earnings or income from self-employment, either from the open labour market or the subsidised labour market, is about one percentage point more common in the treatment group. However, resulting earnings and incomes from self-employment turned out to be 21 euros smaller.In other results based on phone surveys, those who received the universal basic income expressed greater confident in their own future, and they expressed a belief that it would be easier to accept a future job offer. It will be interesting to see if these attitudes lead to actually higher employment as the 2018 data becomes available . It's important to note that like all practical experiments, the Finnish experiment was not a completely pure universal basic income. For example, the experiment targeted the long-term unemployed, not the working poor as a group, and those receiving the benefit still dealt with the government for other support programs, like housing assistance. In adidtion, the experiment would need to be considered in the context of Finland's overall labor market. So the results are preliminary in a number of ways. But it's hard to spin them as encouraging. For those who would like a bunch of links to discussion of the Finnish experiment and broader recent discussions of a universal basic income, a useful starting point is the extended article at the Brueghel website by Catarina Midoes, ""Universal basic income and the Finnish experiment"" (February 18, 2019). For a pragmatic discussion of how a true universal basic income--that is, a payment to everyone that does not phase out regardless of income--might work in a US context, interested readers might start with Universal Basic Income: A Thought Experiment"" (July 29, 2014). If one took all the money from US (nonhealth) antipoverty programs, as well as a number of tax breaks that tend to benefit the middle-and upper-class, one could fund a universal basic income for the US of about $5800 per year.A version of this article first appeared on Conversable Economist.This isn't a left vs right issue. People need to stop thinking that way.﻿Pretty soon you are going to see that fast food restaurants have suddenly replaced a majority of their workforce with robots and AI. And rest assured, it will happen very rapidly once the tech reaches a certain level, which is already imminent. Once McDonalds has stopped hiring minimum wage employees, the trend will already be on the way in every business sector. Something like 30-50% of job opportunities will just completely cease to exist.The current economic model can't possibly stay in operation.What worries me most is none of the politicians are really talking about the situation. It's as if they want to keep us in the dark for just a little longer. So that when people finally realize what is going on, it's already too late for them to have prepared any personal safety net plans.I’m generally more conservative/libertarian but I think universal basic income could be a good idea because it at least avoids one of welfare’s biggest problems. The big problem I’m talking about is that welfare incentivizes the people on it to remain poor. If you begin make too much money then you lose your welfare. UBI doesn’t have that problem since you get it no matter what your job income is.﻿UBI will eliminate large part of the pressure of merely survival and support the need for creative expression and personality/mental care, I personally think an universal basic income will be the next big evolution in economy. And rightfully so. People who are not struggling to survive are happier, and happier people are better and more productive members of society.

Updated: March 8, 2019 @ 6:00 amSPRINGFIELD — It may be a 90-minute drive away, but an ongoing outbreak of measles in Champaign County worries Amber Shipman of Springfield.Her 15-year-old son, Aaron, received a bone-marrow transplant for treatment of leukemia in 2018, and so the Lutheran High School freshman again must go through vaccinations for measles, mumps and other preventable childhood diseases after the transplant erased his immunity.For the next few months, while he receives rounds of shots, Aaron will be especially susceptible to measles, a potentially life-threatening condition that can be spread through the air in public places and is highly contagious.Amber Shipman knows that Interstate 72 is a heavily traveled route between the capital city and Champaign-Urbana. She said an infected person without symptoms could bring measles to Springfield and spread it to Aaron and other people who haven't been immunized, whose immune systems have been compromised or who can't receive vaccines for a medical reason.""It scares me because he really doesn't have any control over this,"" she said. ""He's essentially at school with no protection.""The outbreak of measles in Champaign County, where four cases have been diagnosed — all but one among unvaccinated people and three involving students or staff at the University of Illinois' Urbana-Champaign campus — has alarmed some parents and health professionals in the Springfield area.They remain concerned about periodic measles outbreaks across the country, including a measles outbreak affecting more than 60 people, many of them children, in southwestern Washington state.Health officials say the outbreaks indicate there's a small but growing number of parents nationwide who are skeptical or openly hostile to the proven benefits of vaccines to protect against childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough.Some parents continue to believe that vaccines cause autism and other developmental disabilities even though that theory has been disproven, according to Dr. Douglas Carlson, chief of pediatrics at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and medical director of HSHS St. John's Children's Hospital.Conspiracy theories on the Internet about the influence of pharmaceutical companies, as well as doubt cast by celebrities, have resulted in parents ""looking at pseudo-science and ignoring real science,"" Carlson said.The result in Springfield, he said, is that more parents over the past decade are saying they know what's best for their children when it comes to vaccines after ""doing their own research. ... They are intelligent people who are misguided in their thinking.""Carlson estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of parents bringing their children to SIU's pediatricians and family medicine doctors are inquiring about delaying or stretching out the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines even though there's no benefit to do so and any delays are putting kids at risk of death or disability.""The science is solid,"" Carlson said. ""Vaccines are safe and effective.""SIU doctors don't kick families out of their practices if parents want to vary from the vaccination schedule or avoid vaccines, he said.Instead, Carlson said doctors work hard to convince parents that they are potentially sacrificing their children to the ravages of preventable diseases and endangering other children and adults who are susceptible to infection for medical reasons.Carlson remains concerned about the future.""I think what's happening in Washington is a warning of what might happen here,"" he said.Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said she is confident the outbreak in her community has been relatively contained because of the ""herd immunity"" that results from an immunization rate in Champaign and Urbana schools exceeding 95 percent.""I look at this as a brush fire,"" she said.Sangamon County schools, and Illinois schools on average, post similar immunization levels, based on information from the Illinois State Board of Education. The lowest immunization rates in Illinois tend to be at parochial schools.There hasn't been a diagnosed measles case in Sangamon County in 10 years or more, according to Gail O'Neill, interim director of the Sangamon County Department of Public Health.Scientific evidence suggests that herd immunity can be lost, making disease transmission more likely, when the proportion of unimmunized children exceeds 7 percent to 10 percent of the school population, Carlson said.In Washington's Clark County, where a measles outbreak began in late December, 78 percent of schoolchildren are current with all of their immunizations, according to the Washington Department of Health.Pryde credited the Illinois General Assembly for helping to contain epidemics of childhood diseases when it eliminated the ""personal belief"" exemption for childhood vaccinations in 2015.Before that time, parents were able to simply cite philosophical concerns when opting not to have their kids get shots.The only exemptions that remain for Illinois parents and guardians -- exemptions that allow their children to avoid being excluded from public and private schools -- cite ""religious"" and ""medical"" reasons for avoiding vaccines.Homeschooled children in Illinois aren't covered by any vaccination requirements.Washington and 16 other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, still allow personal-belief exemptions. Washington's health department is trying to convince its state lawmakers to eliminate personal and religious exemptions, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, Washington's state epidemiologist.The opposition to vaccines in Washington cuts across income groups and also can be fueled by overall mistrust of government, Lindquist said.In addition, he favors efforts by the United States to quell measles epidemics in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. Outbreaks overseas have helped to increase infections in the United States because of relatively easy international travel, he said.Pryde and Carlson said Illinois should eliminate the religious exemption, though there is no ongoing campaign to do so, and the Illinois Department of Public Health isn't pushing for a repeal.A 2016 report by the Illinois State Board of Education said the share of students whose parents invoked religious exemptions to vaccines had grown at a small rate -- 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent since 2010-11.Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer for the state health department, said data don't indicate that vaccination levels are dropping statewide.

Updated: March 8, 2019 @ 6:00 amSPRINGFIELD — It may be a 90-minute drive away, but an ongoing outbreak of measles in Champaign County worries Amber Shipman of Springfield.Her 15-year-old son, Aaron, received a bone-marrow transplant for treatment of leukemia in 2018, and so the Lutheran High School freshman again must go through vaccinations for measles, mumps and other preventable childhood diseases after the transplant erased his immunity.For the next few months, while he receives rounds of shots, Aaron will be especially susceptible to measles, a potentially life-threatening condition that can be spread through the air in public places and is highly contagious.Amber Shipman knows that Interstate 72 is a heavily traveled route between the capital city and Champaign-Urbana. She said an infected person without symptoms could bring measles to Springfield and spread it to Aaron and other people who haven't been immunized, whose immune systems have been compromised or who can't receive vaccines for a medical reason.""It scares me because he really doesn't have any control over this,"" she said. ""He's essentially at school with no protection.""The outbreak of measles in Champaign County, where four cases have been diagnosed — all but one among unvaccinated people and three involving students or staff at the University of Illinois' Urbana-Champaign campus — has alarmed some parents and health professionals in the Springfield area.They remain concerned about periodic measles outbreaks across the country, including a measles outbreak affecting more than 60 people, many of them children, in southwestern Washington state.Health officials say the outbreaks indicate there's a small but growing number of parents nationwide who are skeptical or openly hostile to the proven benefits of vaccines to protect against childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough.Some parents continue to believe that vaccines cause autism and other developmental disabilities even though that theory has been disproven, according to Dr. Douglas Carlson, chief of pediatrics at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and medical director of HSHS St. John's Children's Hospital.Conspiracy theories on the Internet about the influence of pharmaceutical companies, as well as doubt cast by celebrities, have resulted in parents ""looking at pseudo-science and ignoring real science,"" Carlson said.The result in Springfield, he said, is that more parents over the past decade are saying they know what's best for their children when it comes to vaccines after ""doing their own research. ... They are intelligent people who are misguided in their thinking.""Carlson estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of parents bringing their children to SIU's pediatricians and family medicine doctors are inquiring about delaying or stretching out the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines even though there's no benefit to do so and any delays are putting kids at risk of death or disability.""The science is solid,"" Carlson said. ""Vaccines are safe and effective.""SIU doctors don't kick families out of their practices if parents want to vary from the vaccination schedule or avoid vaccines, he said.Instead, Carlson said doctors work hard to convince parents that they are potentially sacrificing their children to the ravages of preventable diseases and endangering other children and adults who are susceptible to infection for medical reasons.Carlson remains concerned about the future.""I think what's happening in Washington is a warning of what might happen here,"" he said.Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said she is confident the outbreak in her community has been relatively contained because of the ""herd immunity"" that results from an immunization rate in Champaign and Urbana schools exceeding 95 percent.""I look at this as a brush fire,"" she said.Sangamon County schools, and Illinois schools on average, post similar immunization levels, based on information from the Illinois State Board of Education. The lowest immunization rates in Illinois tend to be at parochial schools.There hasn't been a diagnosed measles case in Sangamon County in 10 years or more, according to Gail O'Neill, interim director of the Sangamon County Department of Public Health.Scientific evidence suggests that herd immunity can be lost, making disease transmission more likely, when the proportion of unimmunized children exceeds 7 percent to 10 percent of the school population, Carlson said.In Washington's Clark County, where a measles outbreak began in late December, 78 percent of schoolchildren are current with all of their immunizations, according to the Washington Department of Health.Pryde credited the Illinois General Assembly for helping to contain epidemics of childhood diseases when it eliminated the ""personal belief"" exemption for childhood vaccinations in 2015.Before that time, parents were able to simply cite philosophical concerns when opting not to have their kids get shots.The only exemptions that remain for Illinois parents and guardians -- exemptions that allow their children to avoid being excluded from public and private schools -- cite ""religious"" and ""medical"" reasons for avoiding vaccines.Homeschooled children in Illinois aren't covered by any vaccination requirements.Washington and 16 other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, still allow personal-belief exemptions. Washington's health department is trying to convince its state lawmakers to eliminate personal and religious exemptions, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, Washington's state epidemiologist.The opposition to vaccines in Washington cuts across income groups and also can be fueled by overall mistrust of government, Lindquist said.In addition, he favors efforts by the United States to quell measles epidemics in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. Outbreaks overseas have helped to increase infections in the United States because of relatively easy international travel, he said.Pryde and Carlson said Illinois should eliminate the religious exemption, though there is no ongoing campaign to do so, and the Illinois Department of Public Health isn't pushing for a repeal.A 2016 report by the Illinois State Board of Education said the share of students whose parents invoked religious exemptions to vaccines had grown at a small rate -- 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent since 2010-11.Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer for the state health department, said data don't indicate that vaccination levels are dropping statewide. But because of more measles outbreaks across the country, she said Illinois officials began to analyze vaccination rates at the local level a few months ago.All states allow medical exemptions, and a few states, including California, Mississippi and West Virginia, don't allow personal or religious exemptions.None of the world's major religions opposes childhood vaccinations, Carlson said.""I am concerned that the religious exemption is being used by people who don't really have religious concerns,"" he said.Even medical exemptions can be abused if parents are working with an unscrupulous doctor, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a community health professor at Ball State University in Indiana.He said 127 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 10 states from Jan. 1 to Feb. 14, including the Illinois outbreak and in California, Colorado, Kentucky, New York and Texas.Khubchandani said any efforts to reduce religious and medical loopholes and hold parents accountable -- criminally or civilly -- for denying their children vaccines should be pursued.""I don't think you should be risking a child's life,"" he said.The professor said vaccine has reduced measles cases in the United States by more than 95 percent since the 1960s and saved more than 20 million lives worldwide since 2000.In Springfield School District 186, 38 students went unimmunized for measles in the 2017-18 academic year because of religious exemptions, according to ISBE data.The students without vaccinations included seven at Springfield High School, six at Iles Elementary, five each at Southern View Elementary and the Early Learning Center, three apiece at Dubois and Lindsay elementary, two at Ball Charter, and one apiece at Lincoln Magnet and at Enos, Lee, Ridgely, Feitshans, Harvard Park and Graham elementary schools.Susan Smith, a school nurse at Springfield's Franklin Middle School, said she speaks for herself in favoring elimination of the religious exemption.

46,Drug Use in Sports,Should Performance Enhancing Drugs (Such as Steroids) Be Accepted in Sports?,1s46q8r,http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/1/e20161300,Use of Performance-Enhancing Substances | From the American Academy of Pediatrics | Pediatrics,"Advertising Disclaimer » Tools and LinksPerformance-enhancing substances (PESs) are used commonly by children and adolescents in attempts to improve athletic performance. More recent data reveal that these same substances often are used for appearance-related reasons as well. PESs include both legal over-the-counter dietary supplements and illicit pharmacologic agents. This report reviews the current epidemiology of PES use in the pediatric population, as well as information on those PESs in most common use. Concerns regarding use of legal PESs include high rates of product contamination, correlation with future use of anabolic androgenic steroids, and adverse effects on the focus and experience of youth sports participation. The physical maturation and endogenous hormone production that occur in adolescence are associated with large improvements in strength and athletic performance. For most young athletes, PES use does not produce significant gains over those seen with the onset of puberty and adherence to an appropriate nutrition and training program.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published position papers, a subject review, guidelines, and textbook chapters regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances (PESs) by children and adolescents.1–3 This clinical report updates and consolidates information on this topic. For the purposes of this report, the term “performance-enhancing substances” will be used to describe the spectrum of dietary supplements, as well as legal and illegal drugs that often are used by athletes for the purpose of improving athletic performance.Over the last 2 decades, the availability of PESs has increased with access to Internet suppliers, proliferation, and marketing of stimulant-containing beverages, and increasing use of topically applied anabolic androgenic steroids. Although the overall use of many PESs may have declined over the past 15 years, reviews of multiple studies have prompted concern that the onset of use may be occurring increasingly in the pediatric population.4Several national studies have been tracking adolescent use of PESs. Monitoring the Future (MTF) is an annual survey of 50 000 students in eighth, 10th, and 12th grade.5 Figs 1, 2, 3, and 4 outline results and trends of PES use as noted in MTF. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a biennial survey that includes a representative cross-section of high school students in the United States. The 2013 YRBSS included surveys from more than 13 500 students and revealed prevalence rates for nonprescribed steroid use that were a bit higher than those in MTF, with 3.2% reporting lifetime use of anabolic androgenic steroids.6 The reported number was higher in boys (4.0%) than in girls (2.2%) and indicated a significant decrease over the previous 12 years, from a high of 5.0% overall use in 2001.Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of anabolic androgenic steroids by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of creatine by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of androstenedione by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of nonprescription diet pills by sex (data from MTF, 2014).5The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study (PATS) is an annual survey of parents and high school students regarding behaviors and attitudes about drugs and substance abuse.7 The 2013 PATS survey included responses from more than 3700 students. Steroid use increased slightly from 5% to 7% as compared with 2012. However, use of synthetic human growth hormone (hGH) almost doubled, from 5% to 11%, after being fairly stable from 2009–2012. The report stated that most of this increase included teenagers who reported a single episode of hGH use and that the number of teenagers who report having used hGH more often has remained consistent.Several studies have demonstrated polypharmacy among users of PESs, with elevated rates of use of both recreational drugs and multiple PESs.5,8,9 MTF has demonstrated a strong association between use of androstenedione, creatine, and anabolic androgenic steroids. Approximately 80% of androstenedione users and more than one-third of steroid users also use creatine. Between 2010 and 2012, approximately half of androstenedione users also were using anabolic androgenic steroids; however, this decreased to 15% in 2013. Younger creatine users are much more likely to be using multiple PESs than their older counterparts (Table 1).Polypharmacy in PES Use5For many adolescents, use of PESs is an attempt to enhance appearance rather than performance, and many users are not actively involved in organized athletic activity. Terms such as “performance- and image-enhancing substances” and “appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs” emphasize their broader appeal.10–13 A Minnesota study evaluating various muscle-enhancing behaviors revealed that in an urban high school population, 38.8% of boys and 18.2% of girls reported a history of protein supplement use.11 The same study revealed rates of use in middle school for boys and girls as 29.7% and 24.7%, respectively. Although students participating in team sports were more likely to use protein supplements (24.2%), it is worth noting that use of protein supplements still was fairly high in students who were not involved in sports (18.2%).11Corroborating this higher use of PESs in an athletic population, a 2012 meta-analysis revealed higher rates of steroid use in athletes than in nonathletes (odds ratio, 1.5).14 In addition to sports participation, other correlates of PES use include body dissatisfaction,12 higher BMI,11 training in a commercial gym,15 and exposure to appearance-focused media.13 The latter was particularly true for the genre of “fitness” media, which tends to have a large focus on muscle development, as opposed to the genre of more traditional sports-reporting media. Multiple studies have revealed correlations between PES use and alcohol and drug use, as well as other risk-taking behaviors.15–17Different patterns of use have been identified between boy and girl PES users. Girls report much lower rates of using substances that are generally associated with gains in strength and muscle mass, such as creatine, androstenedione, and anabolic androgenic steroids, and these differences grow larger with age.5 Conversely, girls report much higher rates of using nonprescription diet pills. Although this is consistent with traditional perceptions of male pursuit of muscularity and female pursuit of thinness, it is important to note that in 2013, 4% of boys reported use of diet pills in 2013, and 1% to 2% of 12th-grade girls reported use of creatine and anabolic androgenic steroids.5,6It is unclear how race and ethnicity may correlate with PES use. YRBSS data revealed higher rates of steroid use in 2013 among Hispanic students (4.2%) as compared with students who identified themselves as white (2.8%) or African American (2.3%).6 These differences were not noted for 12th graders in the 2013 MTF data, in which steroid use rates within these groups were all just under 2.0%.5 One study revealed increased rates of steroid use among Asian students (primarily Hmong) as compared with white students, with odds ratios of 3.51 and 3.37 for boys and girls, respectively.11 The PATS revealed that hGH use was significantly higher in African American and Hispanic teenagers as compared with white teenagers, with use rates of 15%, 13%, and 9% respectively.7The most commonly used PESs in the adolescent population generally are sold over the counter as dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Pub L No. 103-417) created supplements as a category not subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for safety or efficacy before coming to market. Supplements often are intermingled with foods, beverages, and over-the-counter medications on retail shelves, and it is difficult for the consumer to differentiate products with ingredients subject to strong FDA oversight from products that are subject to the looser controls, as allowed by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.Given the lack of manufacturing oversight, consumers of these goods risk using products that are contaminated or missing ingredients. Several studies that tested protein supplements revealed that 8% to 20% of these products were contaminated with significant amounts of heavy metals.18 An analysis of supplements obtained from US retailers in 2007 revealed that 25% of these were contaminated with anabolic androgenic steroids, and 11% were contaminated with stimulants.18 In 2015, the New York attorney general sent cease-and-desist letters to 4 national retailers after an investigation revealed that only 5 of 20 herbal supplement products tested consistently contained active ingredients as listed.19Caffeine is unique in that it is ingested as a dietary supplement but also is contained in many foods that are common in the American diet. Although the FDA does regulate the amount of caffeine in foods (eg, soft drinks are allowed a maximum of 71 mg of caffeine/12 oz), the amount of caffeine in energy drinks and other dietary supplements is not regulated. Additional information on caffeine can be found in Fig 3, as well as the AAP clinical report “Sports Drinks and Energy Drinks for Children and Adolescents: Are They Appropriate?” which specifically states that energy drinks containing stimulants should never be consumed by children and adolescents.20The Anabolic Steroid Control Acts of 1990 (Pub L No. 101-647) and 2004 (Pub L No. 108-358) classified anabolic androgenic steroids, as well as certain precursors that were previously marketed as supplements (such as androstenedione), as Schedule III drugs. The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (Pub L No. 113-260) further expanded the definition of “anabolic steroid” in part to address the expansion of synthetic prohormones that were developed after passage of the 2004 act. These prohormones are all now classified as Schedule III anabolic steroid drugs, and possession or use of any of these substances without a physician’s prescription is prohibited by state and federal laws.A vast number of substances are purported to have ergogenic (ie, performance-enhancing) effects. Claims of performance enhancement with different drugs and supplements are constantly evolving. Initial claims of significant performance enhancement are often made on the Internet as well as in body-building and fitness magazines. These claims most often are unsubstantiated or based on findings from single or poorly designed studies. As these substances undergo further scrutiny, it is common for these initial claims to be debunked, and the evidence often does not support earlier assertions of performance benefit. Although it is not possible to provide a fully comprehensive list of PESs, Table 2 provides an overview of substances that are most widely known and studied in the pediatric population.Summary Table of PES Prevalence, Effects, and Safety Concerns in Children and AdolescentsAny potential ergogenic effects of PESs can be contrasted to the great improvements in strength and athletic performance often observed in child and adolescent athletes attributable to the combined effects of training and development. Typical strength gains of approximately 30% are reported in youth resistance training programs of 8 to 20 weeks’ duration.43 Supplements or nutritional interventions that are currently available and legal cannot rival this rate of gain. The best advice for performance-related concerns in young athletes is to focus on the basics of appropriate training and nutritional practices as outlined in Table 3. PESs are not “shortcuts” to higher levels of athletic performance, and they cannot compensate for athletes who do not adhere to the basic principles of good training and nutrition.Training Principles to Enhance Athletic PerformanceThe goals of the antidoping movement in sports are to protect the health of athletes and to prevent unfair competition, and use of PESs is identified in a survey of adults as the most serious issue facing sports today.46 Potential health risks are outlined for individual substances in Table 2. In addition, the “gateway hypothesis” of adolescent substance abuse may apply with PES use. Although causation is difficult to prove, initial use of legal ergogenic supplements appears to reduce barriers to future nontherapeutic use of anabolic androgenic steroids by increasing social contacts with other users of PESs, as well as changing perceived social norms and attitudes regarding the safety and efficacy of illicit PES use.10,47,48The moral implications of PES use contribute to concerns about cheating and unfair competition and may have adverse effects on the youth sports experience.46 The top 5 issues of importance reported by children and adolescents regarding participation in sports are, in order: having fun, doing one’s best, being with friends, improving skills, and being healthy. PES use shifts the focus of athletes from the pleasure and camaraderie of sports participation to that of gaining competitive advantage.Home drug tests are aggressively marketed on the Internet to parents with concerns about drug use. In a 2014 clinical report, the AAP stated it does not endorse home drug testing because of concerns about lack of efficacy, potential misinterpretation of test results, and the potential negative effect on the parent–child relationship.49 The AAP recommends that parents’ concerns about drug testing be addressed in cooperation with health care providers.Use of PESs often is clinically occult in the pediatric population, without reliable changes that can be detected on physical examination. Bright Futures contains information regarding office assessment, as well as patient and parent education and guidance when substance abuse is a concern.50 Suggestions include screening for substance use as part of an age-appropriate comprehensive history and asking open-ended questions about substance use at home, at school, and by peers before progressing to questions about personal use.The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation form developed by the AAP (https://www.aap.org/en-us/professional-resources/practice-support/Documents/Preparticipation-Physical-Exam-Form.pdf) contains several questions regarding use of PESs. Although sensitivity of these questions has not been studied, the questions provide an opportunity for further discussion and guidance and are as follows:Do you drink alcohol or use other drugs?Have you ever taken anabolic androgenic steroids or used any other performance supplement?Have you ever taken any supplements to help you gain or lose weight or improve your performance?The AAP does not endorse general drug use screening by pediatric health care providers but has published guidelines for drug testing in the pediatric office when there is clinical suspicion of use.49Testing in schools often is proposed not only to provide a mechanism for detecting drug use but also to serve as a deterrent. In 1995, the US Supreme Court ruled that random drug testing of student athletes does not violate the Fourth Amendment, and in 2002, the Court rendered a parallel opinion regarding students participating in other extracurricular activities.51 Since then, schools in a number of states have initiated mandatory-random student drug testing; however, the efficacy of these programs in detecting and preventing drug use is unclear. The University Interscholastic League in Texas runs 1 of the largest high school drug testing programs in the United States. In 2013–2014, the University Interscholastic League conducted 2633 tests for anabolic androgenic steroids with 2 positive results, 7 protocol violations (ie, student did not show up for the test), and 10 inconclusive results.52 Given the prevalence of information available on how to avoid positive anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) test results, it is impossible to know whether this low rate of positive results was a true reflection of reduced AAS use in this population or the result of successful efforts at evading detection.Given the association of AAS use with other risk-taking behaviors, information concerning the effects of these programs on overall rates of drug use may be pertinent. The limited number of studies evaluating school-based drug testing reveal mixed results regarding deterrent effect on use of AAS and other illicit drugs, with 1 study documenting increased rates of risk factors for future drug use.53,54 Because of concerns regarding poor sensitivity, use of limited school resources, and potential adverse effects on student attitudes and behaviors, the AAP does not endorse widespread implementation of school-based testing.53Athletes who are participating at collegiate, elite, or national levels are subject to specific restrictions and possible testing for a variety of ergogenic aids. Therapeutic use of certain medications by the athlete (eg, many attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, β2-agonists, diuretics) may require physician certification. Additional information for athletes and their health care providers is available as follows:US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) runs the antidoping program for the Olympic/Paralympic/Pan American movements. The Web site (http://www.usada.org) includes general educational information, as well as a link to the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited drug list.National Collegiate Athletic Administration (NCAA) maintains Web pages providing information on its banned drug list, testing, and medical exception procedures (http://www.ncaa.org/themes/topics/drug-testing).National Center for Drug Free Sport administers drug-testing programs for the NCAA, as well as many professional leagues and state high school associations. The Web site (http://www.drugfreesport.com) includes additional testing information, as well as a subscription-based information center.Opinions of and information received from family members, school professionals, teammates, coaches, and health care providers all contribute to decision-making about PES use in the pediatric population. When adolescents are considering using PESs, the potential for benefit with PES use appears to outweigh dissuasive factors significantly.55 Therefore, prevention efforts that are directed solely at avoidance of adverse consequences of PES use (ie, getting caught, cost) are likely to be less effective than efforts that focus on the lack of realized benefit for users of PES.Educating athletes and families on basic training principles for pursuit of peak athletic performance may be helpful and should be emphasized as an alternative to PES use (Table 3). USADA provides a comprehensive handbook on this topic for parents, which can be accessed at http://www.truesport.org/library/documents/resources/nutrition_guide/NutritionGuide.pdf.Information contained in the AAP clinical report “The Role of Schools in Combating Illicit Substance Abuse” also is pertinent regarding PES use; however, it does not explicitly address the issue of substances that are used in pursuit of ergogenic benefit.56 The National Institute for Drug Abuse provides teaching materials that cover use of anabolic androgenic steroids and stimulants on its Web site (http://teens.drugabuse.gov/educators/nida-teaching-guides/mind-over-matter/teachers-guide).Adolescents Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids and Athletes Targeting Healthy Exercise and Nutrition Alternatives are programs designed to address PES use in adolescent boys and girls, respectively.57 These structured, sport-centered programs are led by peers with coach facilitation and are considered by the World Anti-Doping Agency as the most rigorously studied and effective way to educate adolescents about doping.58 Both of these programs were developed at Oregon Health and Science University, and additional information can be found at http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/medicine/divisions/hpsm/research/index.cfm.The Taylor Hooton Foundation provides educational resources for schools and other groups. This includes school-based presentations, as well as educational infographics and posters that can be downloaded at no cost (www.http://taylorhooton.org/education-resources/downloads/).Many resources for parents of athletes include information on how to educate and prevent their athletes from using PESs. Publications from USADA cover a variety of issues pertinent to parents of athletes (http://www.truesport.org/library/documents/resources/parent/parent_handbook.pdf). Table 4 summarizes guidance for parents provided by the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.Guidance for Parents With Concerns About PES Use59Trends in PES use are subject to rapid change, with many substances having short-lived reputations as ergogenic aids. A combination of aggressive Internet marketing efforts and the lack of regulatory oversight can make it difficult to assess reliability of information sources on this topic. General information on a broad variety of specific substances is available in the British Journal of Sports Medicine series “A-Z of Nutritional Supplements: Dietary Supplements, Sports Nutrition Foods and Ergogenic Aids for Health and Performance (www.bjsm.bmj.com).”The USADA Web site (http://www.usada.org/substances/) contains information on specific supplements and performance-enhancing drugs and information on how to assess ergogenic claims and make informed decisions regarding dietary supplement use.PES use is common in adolescence, and these substances are used in attempts to enhance both physical performance and appearance.Throughout adolescence, use of all PESs tends to increase with age and is higher in athletes than in nonathletes.Boys are at higher risk than girls for most PES use. Other risk factors for PES use include body dissatisfaction, higher BMI, training in a commercial gym, exposure to appearance-oriented fitness media, use of alcohol or drugs, and other risk-taking behaviors.PESs most commonly used by adolescents are protein supplements, creatine, and caffeine.Many PESs are sold over the counter as dietary supplements. Athletes and parents often are unaware of the lack of FDA oversight of supplements and the risk of contamination with prohibited substances or absent active ingredients in these products.Onset of endogenous hormone secretion during puberty, in combination with appropriate training techniques, is associated with large gains in strength and overall athletic performance. This is particularly true after the onset of peak height velocity. For most adolescent athletes, PES use will not produce significant improvements above those attained with adherence to appropriate nutrition and training fundamentals during this time.It can be difficult to keep pace with the frequent reports of newly recognized PESs. Although the majority of initial reports of PES benefit are subsequently discredited after further study, it can be helpful for pediatric health care providers to steer patients and families to reputable Web-based resources for further evaluation of PES claims.There is concern that initial use of over-the-counter PESs may be associated with increased risk of future anabolic steroid use and other risk-taking behaviors. Younger PES users appear to be at greater risk of polypharmacy.Michele LaBotz, MD, FAAPBernard A. Griesemer, MD, FAAPJoel S. Brenner, MD, MPH, FAAP, ChairpersonCynthia R.

Use of Performance-Enhancing Substances | From the American Academy of Pediatrics | Pediatrics Advertising Disclaimer » Tools and LinksPerformance-enhancing substances (PESs) are used commonly by children and adolescents in attempts to improve athletic performance. More recent data reveal that these same substances often are used for appearance-related reasons as well. PESs include both legal over-the-counter dietary supplements and illicit pharmacologic agents. This report reviews the current epidemiology of PES use in the pediatric population, as well as information on those PESs in most common use. Concerns regarding use of legal PESs include high rates of product contamination, correlation with future use of anabolic androgenic steroids, and adverse effects on the focus and experience of youth sports participation. The physical maturation and endogenous hormone production that occur in adolescence are associated with large improvements in strength and athletic performance. For most young athletes, PES use does not produce significant gains over those seen with the onset of puberty and adherence to an appropriate nutrition and training program.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published position papers, a subject review, guidelines, and textbook chapters regarding the use of performance-enhancing substances (PESs) by children and adolescents.1–3 This clinical report updates and consolidates information on this topic. For the purposes of this report, the term “performance-enhancing substances” will be used to describe the spectrum of dietary supplements, as well as legal and illegal drugs that often are used by athletes for the purpose of improving athletic performance.Over the last 2 decades, the availability of PESs has increased with access to Internet suppliers, proliferation, and marketing of stimulant-containing beverages, and increasing use of topically applied anabolic androgenic steroids. Although the overall use of many PESs may have declined over the past 15 years, reviews of multiple studies have prompted concern that the onset of use may be occurring increasingly in the pediatric population.4Several national studies have been tracking adolescent use of PESs. Monitoring the Future (MTF) is an annual survey of 50 000 students in eighth, 10th, and 12th grade.5 Figs 1, 2, 3, and 4 outline results and trends of PES use as noted in MTF. The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) is a biennial survey that includes a representative cross-section of high school students in the United States. The 2013 YRBSS included surveys from more than 13 500 students and revealed prevalence rates for nonprescribed steroid use that were a bit higher than those in MTF, with 3.2% reporting lifetime use of anabolic androgenic steroids.6 The reported number was higher in boys (4.0%) than in girls (2.2%) and indicated a significant decrease over the previous 12 years, from a high of 5.0% overall use in 2001.Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of anabolic androgenic steroids by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of creatine by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of androstenedione by year and sex (data from MTF, 2014).5Percentage of eighth, 10th, and 12th graders reporting any lifetime use of nonprescription diet pills by sex (data from MTF, 2014).5The Partnership Attitude Tracking Study (PATS) is an annual survey of parents and high school students regarding behaviors and attitudes about drugs and substance abuse.7 The 2013 PATS survey included responses from more than 3700 students. Steroid use increased slightly from 5% to 7% as compared with 2012. However, use of synthetic human growth hormone (hGH) almost doubled, from 5% to 11%, after being fairly stable from 2009–2012. The report stated that most of this increase included teenagers who reported a single episode of hGH use and that the number of teenagers who report having used hGH more often has remained consistent.Several studies have demonstrated polypharmacy among users of PESs, with elevated rates of use of both recreational drugs and multiple PESs.5,8,9 MTF has demonstrated a strong association between use of androstenedione, creatine, and anabolic androgenic steroids. Approximately 80% of androstenedione users and more than one-third of steroid users also use creatine. Between 2010 and 2012, approximately half of androstenedione users also were using anabolic androgenic steroids; however, this decreased to 15% in 2013. Younger creatine users are much more likely to be using multiple PESs than their older counterparts (Table 1).Polypharmacy in PES Use5For many adolescents, use of PESs is an attempt to enhance appearance rather than performance, and many users are not actively involved in organized athletic activity. Terms such as “performance- and image-enhancing substances” and “appearance- and performance-enhancing drugs” emphasize their broader appeal.10–13 A Minnesota study evaluating various muscle-enhancing behaviors revealed that in an urban high school population, 38.8% of boys and 18.2% of girls reported a history of protein supplement use.11 The same study revealed rates of use in middle school for boys and girls as 29.7% and 24.7%, respectively. Although students participating in team sports were more likely to use protein supplements (24.2%), it is worth noting that use of protein supplements still was fairly high in students who were not involved in sports (18.2%).11Corroborating this higher use of PESs in an athletic population, a 2012 meta-analysis revealed higher rates of steroid use in athletes than in nonathletes (odds ratio, 1.5).14 In addition to sports participation, other correlates of PES use include body dissatisfaction,12 higher BMI,11 training in a commercial gym,15 and exposure to appearance-focused media.13 The latter was particularly true for the genre of “fitness” media, which tends to have a large focus on muscle development, as opposed to the genre of more traditional sports-reporting media. Multiple studies have revealed correlations between PES use and alcohol and drug use, as well as other risk-taking behaviors.15–17Different patterns of use have been identified between boy and girl PES users. Girls report much lower rates of using substances that are generally associated with gains in strength and muscle mass, such as creatine, androstenedione, and anabolic androgenic steroids, and these differences grow larger with age.5 Conversely, girls report much higher rates of using nonprescription diet pills. Although this is consistent with traditional perceptions of male pursuit of muscularity and female pursuit of thinness, it is important to note that in 2013, 4% of boys reported use of diet pills in 2013, and 1% to 2% of 12th-grade girls reported use of creatine and anabolic androgenic steroids.5,6It is unclear how race and ethnicity may correlate with PES use. YRBSS data revealed higher rates of steroid use in 2013 among Hispanic students (4.2%) as compared with students who identified themselves as white (2.8%) or African American (2.3%).6 These differences were not noted for 12th graders in the 2013 MTF data, in which steroid use rates within these groups were all just under 2.0%.5 One study revealed increased rates of steroid use among Asian students (primarily Hmong) as compared with white students, with odds ratios of 3.51 and 3.37 for boys and girls, respectively.11 The PATS revealed that hGH use was significantly higher in African American and Hispanic teenagers as compared with white teenagers, with use rates of 15%, 13%, and 9% respectively.7The most commonly used PESs in the adolescent population generally are sold over the counter as dietary supplements. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Pub L No. 103-417) created supplements as a category not subject to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for safety or efficacy before coming to market. Supplements often are intermingled with foods, beverages, and over-the-counter medications on retail shelves, and it is difficult for the consumer to differentiate products with ingredients subject to strong FDA oversight from products that are subject to the looser controls, as allowed by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.Given the lack of manufacturing oversight, consumers of these goods risk using products that are contaminated or missing ingredients. Several studies that tested protein supplements revealed that 8% to 20% of these products were contaminated with significant amounts of heavy metals.18 An analysis of supplements obtained from US retailers in 2007 revealed that 25% of these were contaminated with anabolic androgenic steroids, and 11% were contaminated with stimulants.18 In 2015, the New York attorney general sent cease-and-desist letters to 4 national retailers after an investigation revealed that only 5 of 20 herbal supplement products tested consistently contained active ingredients as listed.19Caffeine is unique in that it is ingested as a dietary supplement but also is contained in many foods that are common in the American diet. Although the FDA does regulate the amount of caffeine in foods (eg, soft drinks are allowed a maximum of 71 mg of caffeine/12 oz), the amount of caffeine in energy drinks and other dietary supplements is not regulated. Additional information on caffeine can be found in Fig 3, as well as the AAP clinical report “Sports Drinks and Energy Drinks for Children and Adolescents: Are They Appropriate?” which specifically states that energy drinks containing stimulants should never be consumed by children and adolescents.20The Anabolic Steroid Control Acts of 1990 (Pub L No. 101-647) and 2004 (Pub L No. 108-358) classified anabolic androgenic steroids, as well as certain precursors that were previously marketed as supplements (such as androstenedione), as Schedule III drugs. The Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (Pub L No. 113-260) further expanded the definition of “anabolic steroid” in part to address the expansion of synthetic prohormones that were developed after passage of the 2004 act. These prohormones are all now classified as Schedule III anabolic steroid drugs, and possession or use of any of these substances without a physician’s prescription is prohibited by state and federal laws.A vast number of substances are purported to have ergogenic (ie, performance-enhancing) effects. Claims of performance enhancement with different drugs and supplements are constantly evolving. Initial claims of significant performance enhancement are often made on the Internet as well as in body-building and fitness magazines. These claims most often are unsubstantiated or based on findings from single or poorly designed studies. As these substances undergo further scrutiny, it is common for these initial claims to be debunked, and the evidence often does not support earlier assertions of performance benefit. Although it is not possible to provide a fully comprehensive list of PESs, Table 2 provides an overview of substances that are most widely known and studied in the pediatric population.Summary Table of PES Prevalence, Effects, and Safety Concerns in Children and AdolescentsAny potential ergogenic effects of PESs can be contrasted to the great improvements in strength and athletic performance often observed in child and adolescent athletes attributable to the combined effects of training and development. Typical strength gains of approximately 30% are reported in youth resistance training programs of 8 to 20 weeks’ duration.43 Supplements or nutritional interventions that are currently available and legal cannot rival this rate of gain. The best advice for performance-related concerns in young athletes is to focus on the basics of appropriate training and nutritional practices as outlined in Table 3. PESs are not “shortcuts” to higher levels of athletic performance, and they cannot compensate for athletes who do not adhere to the basic principles of good training and nutrition.Training Principles to Enhance Athletic PerformanceThe goals of the antidoping movement in sports are to protect the health of athletes and to prevent unfair competition, and use of PESs is identified in a survey of adults as the most serious issue facing sports today.46 Potential health risks are outlined for individual substances in Table 2. In addition, the “gateway hypothesis” of adolescent substance abuse may apply with PES use. Although causation is difficult to prove, initial use of legal ergogenic supplements appears to reduce barriers to future nontherapeutic use of anabolic androgenic steroids by increasing social contacts with other users of PESs, as well as changing perceived social norms and attitudes regarding the safety and efficacy of illicit PES use.10,47,48The moral implications of PES use contribute to concerns about cheating and unfair competition and may have adverse effects on the youth sports experience.46 The top 5 issues of importance reported by children and adolescents regarding participation in sports are, in order: having fun, doing one’s best, being with friends, improving skills, and being healthy. PES use shifts the focus of athletes from the pleasure and camaraderie of sports participation to that of gaining competitive advantage.Home drug tests are aggressively marketed on the Internet to parents with concerns about drug use. In a 2014 clinical report, the AAP stated it does not endorse home drug testing because of concerns about lack of efficacy, potential misinterpretation of test results, and the potential negative effect on the parent–child relationship.49 The AAP recommends that parents’ concerns about drug testing be addressed in cooperation with health care providers.Use of PESs often is clinically occult in the pediatric population, without reliable changes that can be detected on physical examination. Bright Futures contains information regarding office assessment, as well as patient and parent education and guidance when substance abuse is a concern.50 Suggestions include screening for substance use as part of an age-appropriate comprehensive history and asking open-ended questions about substance use at home, at school, and by peers before progressing to questions about personal use.The Preparticipation Physical Evaluation form developed by the AAP (https://www.aap.org/en-us/professional-resources/practice-support/Documents/Preparticipation-Physical-Exam-Form.pdf) contains several questions regarding use of PESs. Although sensitivity of these questions has not been studied, the questions provide an opportunity for further discussion and guidance and are as follows:Do you drink alcohol or use other drugs?Have you ever taken anabolic androgenic steroids or used any other performance supplement?Have you ever taken any supplements to help you gain or lose weight or improve your performance?The AAP does not endorse general drug use screening by pediatric health care providers but has published guidelines for drug testing in the pediatric office when there is clinical suspicion of use.49Testing in schools often is proposed not only to provide a mechanism for detecting drug use but also to serve as a deterrent. In 1995, the US Supreme Court ruled that random drug testing of student athletes does not violate the Fourth Amendment, and in 2002, the Court rendered a parallel opinion regarding students participating in other extracurricular activities.51 Since then, schools in a number of states have initiated mandatory-random student drug testing; however, the efficacy of these programs in detecting and preventing drug use is unclear. The University Interscholastic League in Texas runs 1 of the largest high school drug testing programs in the United States. In 2013–2014, the University Interscholastic League conducted 2633 tests for anabolic androgenic steroids with 2 positive results, 7 protocol violations (ie, student did not show up for the test), and 10 inconclusive results.52 Given the prevalence of information available on how to avoid positive anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) test results, it is impossible to know whether this low rate of positive results was a true reflection of reduced AAS use in this population or the result of successful efforts at evading detection.Given the association of AAS use with other risk-taking behaviors, information concerning the effects of these programs on overall rates of drug use may be pertinent. The limited number of studies evaluating school-based drug testing reveal mixed results regarding deterrent effect on use of AAS and other illicit drugs, with 1 study documenting increased rates of risk factors for future drug use.53,54 Because of concerns regarding poor sensitivity, use of limited school resources, and potential adverse effects on student attitudes and behaviors, the AAP does not endorse widespread implementation of school-based testing.53Athletes who are participating at collegiate, elite, or national levels are subject to specific restrictions and possible testing for a variety of ergogenic aids. Therapeutic use of certain medications by the athlete (eg, many attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medications, β2-agonists, diuretics) may require physician certification. Additional information for athletes and their health care providers is available as follows:US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) runs the antidoping program for the Olympic/Paralympic/Pan American movements. The Web site (http://www.usada.org) includes general educational information, as well as a link to the World Anti-Doping Agency prohibited drug list.National Collegiate Athletic Administration (NCAA) maintains Web pages providing information on its banned drug list, testing, and medical exception procedures (http://www.ncaa.org/themes/topics/drug-testing).National Center for Drug Free Sport administers drug-testing programs for the NCAA, as well as many professional leagues and state high school associations. The Web site (http://www.drugfreesport.com) includes additional testing information, as well as a subscription-based information center.Opinions of and information received from family members, school professionals, teammates, coaches, and health care providers all contribute to decision-making about PES use in the pediatric population. When adolescents are considering using PESs, the potential for benefit with PES use appears to outweigh dissuasive factors significantly.55 Therefore, prevention efforts that are directed solely at avoidance of adverse consequences of PES use (ie, getting caught, cost) are likely to be less effective than efforts that focus on the lack of realized benefit for users of PES.Educating athletes and families on basic training principles for pursuit of peak athletic performance may be helpful and should be emphasized as an alternative to PES use (Table 3). USADA provides a comprehensive handbook on this topic for parents, which can be accessed at http://www.truesport.org/library/documents/resources/nutrition_guide/NutritionGuide.pdf.Information contained in the AAP clinical report “The Role of Schools in Combating Illicit Substance Abuse” also is pertinent regarding PES use; however, it does not explicitly address the issue of substances that are used in pursuit of ergogenic benefit.56 The National Institute for Drug Abuse provides teaching materials that cover use of anabolic androgenic steroids and stimulants on its Web site (http://teens.drugabuse.gov/educators/nida-teaching-guides/mind-over-matter/teachers-guide).Adolescents Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids and Athletes Targeting Healthy Exercise and Nutrition Alternatives are programs designed to address PES use in adolescent boys and girls, respectively.57 These structured, sport-centered programs are led by peers with coach facilitation and are considered by the World Anti-Doping Agency as the most rigorously studied and effective way to educate adolescents about doping.58 Both of these programs were developed at Oregon Health and Science University, and additional information can be found at http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/medicine/divisions/hpsm/research/index.cfm.The Taylor Hooton Foundation provides educational resources for schools and other groups. This includes school-based presentations, as well as educational infographics and posters that can be downloaded at no cost (www.http://taylorhooton.org/education-resources/downloads/).Many resources for parents of athletes include information on how to educate and prevent their athletes from using PESs. Publications from USADA cover a variety of issues pertinent to parents of athletes (http://www.truesport.org/library/documents/resources/parent/parent_handbook.pdf).

45,Video Games and Violence,Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?,2s45q10r,https://www.businessinsider.com/video-games-and-violence-2018-3,"Video games, gaming disorder, and violence: How video games affect you - Business Insider","Video games are one of the most popular and commonly enjoyed forms of entertainment of our time, yet there's a lot of controversy around them. The World Health Organization recently decided to add ""gaming disorder"" to its official list of mental health conditions, stating that gaming behavior could qualify as problematic if it interferes significantly in other areas of people's lives. Some people have also suggested there are links between playing video games and violent behavior, especially in the wake of tragic events like the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. ""I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts,"" President Donald Trump said after the Parkland shooting. President Obama had similar questions after the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newton, Connecticut. ""Congress will fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds,"" he said at the time (while also calling for policies that would ban the purchase of military-style weapons and improve background checks for firearm purchases in order to curb gun violence). But many other people have pointed out that some types of games offer benefits, including the potential to improve people's ability to pay attention and process visual information. For all of these reasons, people have lots of questions surrounding what science says about the effects of video games. Do games cause violence or aggression? Are they addictive? Are they healthy ways to relax and de-stress? Could they improve brain processing speed? Similar questions have arisen after every new form of media appeared — including television, movies, pop music, comics, and even books. Fortunately, there's a fair amount of research that about how video games affect our brains and bodies. Here are the most important takeaways. According to the Entertainment Software Association's (ESA) 2017 survey: The World Health Organization recently decided to add ""gaming disorder"" to its list of mental health conditions in the update of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), released June 18. The definition of the condition states that gaming behavior could be a disorder if it meets three characteristics: if a person loses control over their gaming habits, if they start to prioritize gaming over many other interests or activities, and if they continue playing despite clear negative consequences. This would put gaming on a similar level as other behaviors that can become problematic if people lose control over them, though the concept of behavioral addiction is controversial in the first place. Some researchers are uncertain about calling gaming ""addictive,"" since problematic gaming may in some cases serve as a dysfunctional coping mechanism for people struggling with depression or anxiety. One review of research by the American Psychological Association found that people who played violent video games were very slightly more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (actions like playing a loud sound that people they were competing against could hear over an audio system). However, the APA said playing games was not enough to cause aggression. Other studies have found no link between game violence and violent or aggressive thoughts. Some researchers, like APA member Chris Ferguson, have even disputed findings connecting games to aggression, saying many of the studies that drew such conclusions had methodological problems. Either way, aggressive behavior is not the same as violence. A 2015 study found that in the months after popular violent video games are released, aggravated assault and homicide rates tend to drop. The researchers behind the study said the explanations for this correlation are complicated. Some scientists think people might experience some aggression-reducing catharsis from playing violent games; others say that aggressive people might seek out violent media and then play games instead of engaging in behavior that might lead to criminal activity. Either way, there doesn't seem to be any increase in criminal activity associated with playing games. Psychology professors Patrick Markey and Christopher Ferguson found that about 20% of school shooters played violent video games, compared to close to 70% of their nonviolent peers. A 2004 report on school shooters by the US Secret Service and Department of Education found that only 12% of school shooters displayed an interest in violent video games. It's easy to find video games that depict blood, gore, and violence. Yet studies show that youth violence has consistently declined as these games have become available. One study out of Boston University found that youth violence rates dropped 29% between 2002 and 2014. Youth violence rates spiked from 1980 to 1994, according to the Urban Institute. But those rates started to plummet in the 1990s, dropping 34% between 1994 and 2000. This is just a correlation — it does not mean that games cause violence rates to drop. But it also doesn't support the idea that violent games are ""creating monsters,"" as Trump put it in 2012. Various political figures have blamed school shootings on kids playing violent video games. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said guns were not a problem but that games desensitized players to the value of human life. NRA President Wayne LaPierre said after the Sandy Hook shooting that ""Guns don't kill people. Video games, the media, and Obama's budget kill people."" But a comparison of the 10 largest video game markets in the world shows that there are far more gun murders in the US than in other countries that spend a lot of money on video games. That's even true in countries that spend more on games per capita than the US does, including Germany, Australia, the UK, Canada, France, Japan, and South Korea. If video games were responsible for violence, there should be more violence in those countries. Researchers have found that video-game players can outperform non-gamers on visual tasks, and several studies have shown that video games can ""train"" visual processing skills in ways that translate to other activities. In one study, researchers found that playing what they call ""action"" games (like ""Call of Duty"" or ""Destiny"") can lead to an improved visual acuity and ability to find objects in a distracting setting. A review of similar research found that the improvements gamers experience are as effective as formal courses designed to increase visual processing ability. One review of research on video-game players found that people who played shooter games were better able to filter out distractions while engaged in attention-demanding tasks. The players were less distracted by other visual information than non-gamers in several studies the researchers analyzed. The same abilities weren't necessarily found in gamers who played other types of games, though. Researchers studying the effects of gaming have asked gamers and non-gamers to complete a new motor-skills task that they hadn't seen before. They found that neither group was necessarily better than the other at the start, and both groups improved at the task over time. But the group that played video games became significantly more accurate by the end of the experiment. Another small study found that young children who played video games had improved motor skills compared to their peers, though the researchers weren't certain whether these kids were simply more drawn to these games in the first place because of that skill. Still, a review on the topic found that faster reaction times tend to be consistently associated with video game play. A number of studies show that the more time kids spend engaged in sedentary behavior, the more likely they are to be overweight. One study of German children found that kids who spent less than 1.5 hours a day in front of a TV were 75% less likely to be overweight than kids who spent more than 1.5 hours in front of a screen. This isn't surprising, since the more time people spend sitting in general, the more likely they are to be overweight. And that can have serious health consequences in the long run. It's worth noting, however, that other studies have shown that socioeconomic and demographic factors have a bigger impact on childhood obesity than game playing. Researchers who tracked Canadian high schoolers found that kids who played sports video games were more involved in sports. When kids started playing those games, they also became more likely to play real-life sports more in the future. The researchers think that the games provided knowledge of the sport, which gave the children confidence that helped them get more involved in real life. Since many games include some puzzle-solving requirements, researchers have speculated that games could improve problem-solving skills and change the way people learn. In one study of ""World of Warcraft"" players, researchers found improved problem-solving capacity, but they weren't sure whether the game made people better at solving problems or whether those people were drawn to the game in the first place. Another study tracked kids who played strategy and role-playing games (like ""Civilization V"" or ""Fable"") and found they developed improved problem-solving abilities over the next year, indicating there may be some link. Some researchers have found that kids who played video games were more creative than kids who didn't play — and it didn't matter which type of video game was used. The same thing was not true for other technology use, like use of cell phones or the internet. But again, researchers aren't sure whether games made kids more creative or creative kids were drawn to games. People play video games to relax, and research finds games can indeed help with that. Studies have shown that puzzle video games can decrease stress and improve mood. According to research from the American Psychological Association, games can elicit a range of emotions, positive and negative — including satisfaction, relaxation, frustration, and anger. Experiencing these emotions in a gaming context may help people regulate emotions, learn to cope with situations, and challenge themselves, the APA said. Other studies have shown that kids who play moderate amounts of games (less than an hour per day) have fewer emotional issues and are more likely to help others than kids who don't play games. Virtual-reality environments provide safe but real-feeling scenarios in which people can face fears and difficult situations with the support of a therapist. New technology is making these sorts of interventions much more accessible than they used to be. VR has been used to provide exposure therapy for people with PTSD or phobias, as well as to provide scenarios that help heroin addicts deal with triggering moments. Researchers have also used VR as an alternative to painkillers, since entering a ""new reality"" allows someone's brain to forget the pain they're dealing with during surgery. One study of 10- to 15-year-old children found that kids who played less than an hour of video games per day were more satisfied than kids who didn't play games or kids who played one to three hours per day. The groups of kids that didn't play or played between one and three hours daily seemed to have the same level life satisfaction. Kids who played more than three hours a day were less satisfied than any of the other groups. From what we know, there are ways that video games can help people relax, challenge themselves, and even push their cognitive abilities. At the same time, it's quite possible that excessive time spent playing games — as with any hobby — may be unhealthy or a sign that someone is struggling. But in general, video games seem to be just another form of entertainment.",2,10,Neutral,Neutral,Against,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Against']","Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence? Video games, gaming disorder, and violence: How video games affect you - Business Insider Video games are one of the most popular and commonly enjoyed forms of entertainment of our time, yet there's a lot of controversy around them. The World Health Organization recently decided to add ""gaming disorder"" to its official list of mental health conditions, stating that gaming behavior could qualify as problematic if it interferes significantly in other areas of people's lives. Some people have also suggested there are links between playing video games and violent behavior, especially in the wake of tragic events like the school shooting in Parkland, Florida. ""I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts,"" President Donald Trump said after the Parkland shooting. President Obama had similar questions after the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newton, Connecticut. ""Congress will fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds,"" he said at the time (while also calling for policies that would ban the purchase of military-style weapons and improve background checks for firearm purchases in order to curb gun violence). But many other people have pointed out that some types of games offer benefits, including the potential to improve people's ability to pay attention and process visual information. For all of these reasons, people have lots of questions surrounding what science says about the effects of video games. Do games cause violence or aggression? Are they addictive? Are they healthy ways to relax and de-stress? Could they improve brain processing speed? Similar questions have arisen after every new form of media appeared — including television, movies, pop music, comics, and even books. Fortunately, there's a fair amount of research that about how video games affect our brains and bodies. Here are the most important takeaways. According to the Entertainment Software Association's (ESA) 2017 survey: The World Health Organization recently decided to add ""gaming disorder"" to its list of mental health conditions in the update of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), released June 18. The definition of the condition states that gaming behavior could be a disorder if it meets three characteristics: if a person loses control over their gaming habits, if they start to prioritize gaming over many other interests or activities, and if they continue playing despite clear negative consequences. This would put gaming on a similar level as other behaviors that can become problematic if people lose control over them, though the concept of behavioral addiction is controversial in the first place. Some researchers are uncertain about calling gaming ""addictive,"" since problematic gaming may in some cases serve as a dysfunctional coping mechanism for people struggling with depression or anxiety. One review of research by the American Psychological Association found that people who played violent video games were very slightly more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (actions like playing a loud sound that people they were competing against could hear over an audio system). However, the APA said playing games was not enough to cause aggression. Other studies have found no link between game violence and violent or aggressive thoughts. Some researchers, like APA member Chris Ferguson, have even disputed findings connecting games to aggression, saying many of the studies that drew such conclusions had methodological problems. Either way, aggressive behavior is not the same as violence. A 2015 study found that in the months after popular violent video games are released, aggravated assault and homicide rates tend to drop. The researchers behind the study said the explanations for this correlation are complicated. Some scientists think people might experience some aggression-reducing catharsis from playing violent games; others say that aggressive people might seek out violent media and then play games instead of engaging in behavior that might lead to criminal activity. Either way, there doesn't seem to be any increase in criminal activity associated with playing games. Psychology professors Patrick Markey and Christopher Ferguson found that about 20% of school shooters played violent video games, compared to close to 70% of their nonviolent peers. A 2004 report on school shooters by the US Secret Service and Department of Education found that only 12% of school shooters displayed an interest in violent video games. It's easy to find video games that depict blood, gore, and violence. Yet studies show that youth violence has consistently declined as these games have become available. One study out of Boston University found that youth violence rates dropped 29% between 2002 and 2014. Youth violence rates spiked from 1980 to 1994, according to the Urban Institute. But those rates started to plummet in the 1990s, dropping 34% between 1994 and 2000. This is just a correlation — it does not mean that games cause violence rates to drop. But it also doesn't support the idea that violent games are ""creating monsters,"" as Trump put it in 2012. Various political figures have blamed school shootings on kids playing violent video games. Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said guns were not a problem but that games desensitized players to the value of human life. NRA President Wayne LaPierre said after the Sandy Hook shooting that ""Guns don't kill people. Video games, the media, and Obama's budget kill people."" But a comparison of the 10 largest video game markets in the world shows that there are far more gun murders in the US than in other countries that spend a lot of money on video games. That's even true in countries that spend more on games per capita than the US does, including Germany, Australia, the UK, Canada, France, Japan, and South Korea. If video games were responsible for violence, there should be more violence in those countries. Researchers have found that video-game players can outperform non-gamers on visual tasks, and several studies have shown that video games can ""train"" visual processing skills in ways that translate to other activities. In one study, researchers found that playing what they call ""action"" games (like ""Call of Duty"" or ""Destiny"") can lead to an improved visual acuity and ability to find objects in a distracting setting. A review of similar research found that the improvements gamers experience are as effective as formal courses designed to increase visual processing ability.

51,Minimum Wage,Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?,2s51q8r,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/2/8/18215425/raise-the-wage-act-2019-15-minimum,Raise the Wage Act 2019: House bill would raise the minimum wage to $15 - Vox,"The Raise the Wage Act is the most ambitious effort yet to overhaul the federal minimum wage.First it was Seattle, then San Francisco. Later, it was the entire state of California, then Massachusetts, New York, and Washington, DC. In January, New Jersey became the latest state to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now Democrats in Congress are pushing for a $15 minimum wage in every state.On Thursday, the House Committee on Education and Labor held its first hearing on the Raise the Wage Act, which would eventually double the federal minimum wage by 2024. The current minimum has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. The law would also tie future changes to the minimum wage based on changes to median workers’ pay. So if middle-class wages go up — or down — so does the minimum wage.The bill, which has more than 190 co-sponsors (all Democrats), would also phase out the lower minimum wage for tipped workers — such as restaurant servers and valets — which has been $2.13 an hour since 1996. Fast-food workers have been at the forefront of this effort to increase wages. Within five years, they’ve transformed an improbable proposal into a popular policy — one that would address, in part, the slow wage growth American workers are experiencing.Business groups, meanwhile, are not happy about the fight for $15. And neither are their Republican allies in Congress. They’ve long pushed back against any effort to raise the federal minimum wage, claiming it would destroy small business and trigger massive job losses.But it’s getting harder and harder for Republicans to justify their view that free-market capitalism — the idea that when the economy grows and unemployment is low, employers will be forced to raise wages — will take care of everyone. It may have happened in the past, but the strong economy is not raising wages right now —at least, not fast enough to outpace the rising cost of living. In addition to this, Americans want Congress to raise the federal minimum wage. Poll after poll shows widespread support, even among Republican voters. And a majority of voters want it increased to $15 an hour. That may explain why Thomas Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, recently toned down his usual criticism of efforts to raise the minimum wage, saying the chamber is “going to listen.”During Thursday’s hearing, a McDonald’s employee from Missouri made the most compelling case for the new legislation.“My family has been homeless despite two incomes. We’ve endured freezing temperatures in our purple minivan,” said Terrence Wise, a 39-year-old father of three daughters. “Try waking up in the morning and getting ready for work and school in a parking lot with your family of five. That’s something a parent can never forget and a memory you can never take away from your children. You should never have multiple jobs in the United States and nowhere to sleep.”Wise’s presence as an expert witness at the Congressional hearing on Thursday showed just how powerful the Fight for $15 movement has become. And their growing influence is challenging the long-held power of big-business lobbyists on Capitol Hill.Perhaps no other exchange reflects the deep partisan division over raising the minimum wage than the opening comments on Thursday from the ranking members of the House labor committee.Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, introduced the Raise the Wage Act in January and now chairs the House labor committee. He has introduced similar bills in the past and Republicans always blocked them. The $15 proposal is even more ambitious than the last one in 2015, which called for a $12 federal wage floor.“The federal minimum wage is no longer serving its purpose. There is no place in America where a full-time worker who is paid the current federal minimum wage can afford the basic essentials,” Scott said during his opening statements.Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking Republican on the committee, called the bill a “radical” idea from the “far left” when she had her turn at the microphone.“This is an empty promise,” Foxx said. “Raising the federal minimum wage will not help workers make ends meet.”But this wage controversy is not just about pro-labor politics versus pro-business politics. There’s also plenty of debate about the economic impact of raising the minimum wage.There are few topics US economists have researched more than the impact of raising a minimum wage. Their findings have varied over the last 30 years, but there are two things most mainstream economists now agree on. First, that raising the minimum wage increases the average income of low-wage workers, lifting many out of poverty (depending on how big the raise is). Second, raising the minimum wage likely causes some job losses.The remaining disagreement revolves around how extreme the job cuts would be.Some research suggests hundreds of thousands of American workers could lose their jobs with a modest increase to the minimum wage.During Thursday’s hearing, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist at the conservative American Action Forum, pointed to a 2014 study from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that a $10.10 federal wage floor could lead to about 500,000 lost jobs because higher labor costs would lead some employers to scale back their staff. Other research concludes that increasing the minimum wage has an insignificant impact on employment, or none at all. The best way to evaluate all the different conclusions is to analyze all the research findings together — what scientists call a “meta-analysis.” And the most recent ones suggest that the most likely impact on employment is minimal.For example, a 2016 study by economists at Michigan State University crunched data from 60 research studies on the minimum wage in the United States since 2001. They concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage would likely reduce overall employment from 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent. Another meta-analysis comes in a new research paper by economists at the University of Massachusetts, University College London and the Economic Policy Institute. They studied data from 138 cities and states that raised the minimum pay between 1979 and 2016. The conclusion is that low-wage workers received a 7 percent pay bump after a minimum-wage law went into effect, but there was little or no change in employment.In a 2018 working paper, soon to be published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, economist Arindrajit Dube shows that raising the minimum wage significantly reduces the number of families living in poverty. For example, he concludes that a $12 minimum wage in 2017 would have lifted 6.2 million people out of poverty. But businesses, for the most part, really dislike the idea of raising the minimum wage. The US Chamber of Commerce, the US Business Council and the Restaurant Association are just a few of the big industry groups that have lobbied aggressively against past attempts to do so. Of course it would cost businesses more to pay workers more, and would likely lead to some jobs losses. But business groups have hyped up the economic impact of raising wages to the extreme, suggesting the economy would collapse and mass layoffs would ensue. What the research shows, however, is that this just isn’t true.Under federal law, businesses can pay certain workers less than the $7.25 federal minimum wage if those workers make most of their money in tips. This has traditionally included restaurant servers, bartenders, valets, and bellhops. According to the law, businesses can pay these workers the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour. If the worker doesn’t earn enough tips to make the full minimum wage, the employer has to make up the difference.Under this system, the customer essentially subsidizes workers’ wages with gratuities. Some states require businesses to pay a higher subminimum wage to tipped workers than the federal one. Seven states — Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington — eliminated the two-tier system entirely decades ago or never allowed the practice. Critics of the subminimum wage say too many employers don’t keep track of workers’ tips to make sure they’re at least earning the full minimum wage. Voters in the District of Columbia recently opted to abolish the separate wages floors, but city lawmakers overturned it. The Restaurant Opportunities Center, a nonprofit labor group pushing for equal wages for restaurant workers across the United States, points out that the poverty rate among tipped workers in states with only one minimum wage is far lower than the poverty rate for tipped workers in other states. Employers pay the full minimum wage to the 1.2 million tipped workers who live in those seven states.And these workers still earn tips. Data about tipping rates is scarce, but one analysis of tips left on credit cards shows that customers in states without a lower tipped minimum wage still leave gratuities. Alaska had one of the highest average tipping rates (17 percent); California and Oregon had among the lowest. But even the states that were ranked toward the bottom had at least a 15 percent tipping rate.The push to eliminate the tipped minimum wage highlights how America has historically treated tipped workers differently than the rest of the US labor force.Congress didn’t include protections for them when it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and a federal minimum wage. The law was amended in 1966 to include tipped workers, but they were still considered a class apart from other workers.The amendment created a subminimum wage for tipped workers: 50 percent of the federal minimum. Employers could count a worker’s tips toward the other 50 percent needed to make sure they earned minimum wage. This is known as a “tip credit.”On days when workers don’t make enough tips to earn the federal minimum wage, employers must pay the difference. The subminimum wage marked a major change to tipping culture in America, essentially turning customer gratuities into wage subsidies.In 1996, Congress made another significant change. It set the minimum wage for tipped workers at $2.13 an hour instead of calculating it as a percentage (half) of the federal minimum wage (at the time, the full minimum wage was $4.26). The move was viewed as a concession to the National Restaurant Association and House Republicans who didn’t want to hike the minimum wage.Since then, Congress has raised the federal minimum wage — but not the minimum for tipped workers. That means that over the years, tips have come to make up a larger share of workers’ incomes. Some states have raised the subminimum wage, but 18 states have done neither.There hasn’t been much action at the federal level. Democrats in Congress introduced a bill in 2017 that would have raised the federal minimum wage and phased out the tipped minimum wage, but it didn’t get enough support. Earlier, in 2014, the Obama administration suggested that it was time for the federal government to do away with the two-tiered system, arguing that restaurants aren’t making sure that servers earn the full minimum wage after tips.The system places too much trust in employers to make sure their workers are earning enough in tips to meet the federal minimum wage, according the 2014 report from Obama’s economic advisers. When surveyed, more than one in 10 workers in predominantly tipped occupations report hourly wages below the full federal minimum wage, including tips.The restaurant industry has fought hard to stop efforts to abolish this pay structure. The National Restaurants Association is leading this fight and was instrumental in overturning a ballot initiative voters passed in Washington, DC, to eliminate the tipped minimum wage.The association has long resisted any type of minimum wage hike, saying they “ratchet up restaurants’ labor costs and result in thousands of jobs lost.” So far, they have stayed silent on the Raise the Wage Act.The Raise the Wage Act would also remove a little-known exemption in federal law that allows employers to pay some disabled workers pennies per hour.Because lawmakers assumed Americans with disabilities would probably never work, Congress allowed businesses to pay them less than the minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The law basically said a business could pay workers with disabilities as little as a few dollars — or cents — an hour to do menial tasks in a “workshop” environment with other disabled workers. The idea was that low-paid work was better than not having the option to work at all. The best known example of this is Goodwill, though the organization is trying to move away from the traditional workshop model in some cases. During the civil rights era, advocates began pushing back against this paternalistic, custodial attitude, which led to a series of laws mandating equal access and equal treatment for Americans with disabilities. The landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 made it illegal for the first time for employers to discriminate against workers with disabilities. While these changes made huge strides in allowing Americans with disabilities to lead normal lives, they didn’t address the 1938 federal law that allows businesses to pay less than minimum wage in some cases. As part of the law, employers apply for a waiver from the US Department of Labor seeking permission to pay a disabled worker less than the full minimum. They must show evidence that the worker’s mental or physical disability impairs their ability to do the job. For example, if it takes the disabled worker twice as long to do a task than it does for a worker without disabilities, they could pay the disabled worker half the minimum wage.Disability rights advocates have been pushing back against this practice. They want the federal government to prioritize services that focus on independence and integration over the isolation of mental institutions or segregated workshops. About 13 percent of Americans have mental or physical disabilities, and they are far less likely to work than the average American. Even so, 36 percent of Americans with disabilities had jobs in 2016 (among those who are of working age and not living in institutions), according to a recent report from the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire.Advocates have been pressuring states to ban the subminimum wage, but only three have so far. New Hampshire was the first state to outlaw it in 2015, followed by Maryland in 2016 and Alaska in 2018. Banning the practice at the federal level would be a major victory, essentially outlawing the subminimum wage everywhere. Under the law, the Department of Labor would immediately stop issuing new waivers to employers. Those that already have them would need to gradually raise wages each year so they are paying the full $15 minimum wage by 2026. There has been little pushback from employers who pay workers less than the minimum wage, likely because these workers make up such a small part of the workforce. The Raise the Wage Act is not perfect; there are millions of low-wage workers who get a zero percent pay increase under the law. That’s because federal labor laws exempt so many workers from these types of protections.It’s important to keep in mind that minimum wage laws enshrined in the Fair Labor Standard Act do not cover all workers, including those in the gig economy. Under federal law, businesses do not need to pay independent contractors and freelancers the minimum wage or overtime. Think Uber drivers and Instacart employees.The Fair Labor Standards Act also excludes farmworkers and housekeepers from the right to earn the minimum wage or get overtime pay. They were excluded as a concession to Southern lawmakers, whose states were highly invested in paying low wages to these groups of workers. At the time, that workforce was overwhelmingly black and Latinx, and excluding them from a minimum wage was intentional. Today, about a quarter of farmworkers and 67 percent of housekeepers earn less than the minimum wage.All this goes to show why a $15 minimum wage is the most obvious solution to lift millions of families out of poverty. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates that the Raise the Wage Act could boost the paychecks of 40 million workers.The chances of passing the law in the Democratic-controlled House are pretty good. The challenge will be to get enough Republican senators on board with the idea. In the past, GOP lawmakers have been overwhelmingly resistant to changing the minimum wage. But it’s getting harder for them to make the case that businesses will raise wages on their own.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.",2,8,Neutral,Pro,Pro,0,Pro,"['Neutral', 'Pro', 'Pro']","Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?

The $15 proposal is even more ambitious than the last one in 2015, which called for a $12 federal wage floor.“The federal minimum wage is no longer serving its purpose. There is no place in America where a full-time worker who is paid the current federal minimum wage can afford the basic essentials,” Scott said during his opening statements.Rep. Virginia Foxx, the ranking Republican on the committee, called the bill a “radical” idea from the “far left” when she had her turn at the microphone.“This is an empty promise,” Foxx said. “Raising the federal minimum wage will not help workers make ends meet.”But this wage controversy is not just about pro-labor politics versus pro-business politics. There’s also plenty of debate about the economic impact of raising the minimum wage.There are few topics US economists have researched more than the impact of raising a minimum wage. Their findings have varied over the last 30 years, but there are two things most mainstream economists now agree on. First, that raising the minimum wage increases the average income of low-wage workers, lifting many out of poverty (depending on how big the raise is). Second, raising the minimum wage likely causes some job losses.The remaining disagreement revolves around how extreme the job cuts would be.Some research suggests hundreds of thousands of American workers could lose their jobs with a modest increase to the minimum wage.During Thursday’s hearing, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist at the conservative American Action Forum, pointed to a 2014 study from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that a $10.10 federal wage floor could lead to about 500,000 lost jobs because higher labor costs would lead some employers to scale back their staff. Other research concludes that increasing the minimum wage has an insignificant impact on employment, or none at all. The best way to evaluate all the different conclusions is to analyze all the research findings together — what scientists call a “meta-analysis.” And the most recent ones suggest that the most likely impact on employment is minimal.For example, a 2016 study by economists at Michigan State University crunched data from 60 research studies on the minimum wage in the United States since 2001. They concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage would likely reduce overall employment from 0.5 percent to 1.2 percent. Another meta-analysis comes in a new research paper by economists at the University of Massachusetts, University College London and the Economic Policy Institute. They studied data from 138 cities and states that raised the minimum pay between 1979 and 2016. The conclusion is that low-wage workers received a 7 percent pay bump after a minimum-wage law went into effect, but there was little or no change in employment.In a 2018 working paper, soon to be published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, economist Arindrajit Dube shows that raising the minimum wage significantly reduces the number of families living in poverty. For example, he concludes that a $12 minimum wage in 2017 would have lifted 6.2 million people out of poverty. But businesses, for the most part, really dislike the idea of raising the minimum wage. The US Chamber of Commerce, the US Business Council and the Restaurant Association are just a few of the big industry groups that have lobbied aggressively against past attempts to do so. Of course it would cost businesses more to pay workers more, and would likely lead to some jobs losses. But business groups have hyped up the economic impact of raising wages to the extreme, suggesting the economy would collapse and mass layoffs would ensue. What the research shows, however, is that this just isn’t true.Under federal law, businesses can pay certain workers less than the $7.25 federal minimum wage if those workers make most of their money in tips. This has traditionally included restaurant servers, bartenders, valets, and bellhops. According to the law, businesses can pay these workers the tipped minimum wage of $2.13 an hour. If the worker doesn’t earn enough tips to make the full minimum wage, the employer has to make up the difference.Under this system, the customer essentially subsidizes workers’ wages with gratuities. Some states require businesses to pay a higher subminimum wage to tipped workers than the federal one. Seven states — Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington — eliminated the two-tier system entirely decades ago or never allowed the practice. Critics of the subminimum wage say too many employers don’t keep track of workers’ tips to make sure they’re at least earning the full minimum wage. Voters in the District of Columbia recently opted to abolish the separate wages floors, but city lawmakers overturned it. The Restaurant Opportunities Center, a nonprofit labor group pushing for equal wages for restaurant workers across the United States, points out that the poverty rate among tipped workers in states with only one minimum wage is far lower than the poverty rate for tipped workers in other states. Employers pay the full minimum wage to the 1.2 million tipped workers who live in those seven states.And these workers still earn tips. Data about tipping rates is scarce, but one analysis of tips left on credit cards shows that customers in states without a lower tipped minimum wage still leave gratuities. Alaska had one of the highest average tipping rates (17 percent); California and Oregon had among the lowest. But even the states that were ranked toward the bottom had at least a 15 percent tipping rate.The push to eliminate the tipped minimum wage highlights how America has historically treated tipped workers differently than the rest of the US labor force.Congress didn’t include protections for them when it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which established the 40-hour workweek and a federal minimum wage. The law was amended in 1966 to include tipped workers, but they were still considered a class apart from other workers.The amendment created a subminimum wage for tipped workers: 50 percent of the federal minimum. Employers could count a worker’s tips toward the other 50 percent needed to make sure they earned minimum wage. This is known as a “tip credit.”On days when workers don’t make enough tips to earn the federal minimum wage, employers must pay the difference. The subminimum wage marked a major change to tipping culture in America, essentially turning customer gratuities into wage subsidies.In 1996, Congress made another significant change. It set the minimum wage for tipped workers at $2.13 an hour instead of calculating it as a percentage (half) of the federal minimum wage (at the time, the full minimum wage was $4.26). The move was viewed as a concession to the National Restaurant Association and House Republicans who didn’t want to hike the minimum wage.Since then, Congress has raised the federal minimum wage — but not the minimum for tipped workers. That means that over the years, tips have come to make up a larger share of workers’ incomes. Some states have raised the subminimum wage, but 18 states have done neither.There hasn’t been much action at the federal level. Democrats in Congress introduced a bill in 2017 that would have raised the federal minimum wage and phased out the tipped minimum wage, but it didn’t get enough support. Earlier, in 2014, the Obama administration suggested that it was time for the federal government to do away with the two-tiered system, arguing that restaurants aren’t making sure that servers earn the full minimum wage after tips.The system places too much trust in employers to make sure their workers are earning enough in tips to meet the federal minimum wage, according the 2014 report from Obama’s economic advisers. When surveyed, more than one in 10 workers in predominantly tipped occupations report hourly wages below the full federal minimum wage, including tips.The restaurant industry has fought hard to stop efforts to abolish this pay structure. The National Restaurants Association is leading this fight and was instrumental in overturning a ballot initiative voters passed in Washington, DC, to eliminate the tipped minimum wage.The association has long resisted any type of minimum wage hike, saying they “ratchet up restaurants’ labor costs and result in thousands of jobs lost.” So far, they have stayed silent on the Raise the Wage Act.The Raise the Wage Act would also remove a little-known exemption in federal law that allows employers to pay some disabled workers pennies per hour.Because lawmakers assumed Americans with disabilities would probably never work, Congress allowed businesses to pay them less than the minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The law basically said a business could pay workers with disabilities as little as a few dollars — or cents — an hour to do menial tasks in a “workshop” environment with other disabled workers. The idea was that low-paid work was better than not having the option to work at all. The best known example of this is Goodwill, though the organization is trying to move away from the traditional workshop model in some cases. During the civil rights era, advocates began pushing back against this paternalistic, custodial attitude, which led to a series of laws mandating equal access and equal treatment for Americans with disabilities. The landmark Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 made it illegal for the first time for employers to discriminate against workers with disabilities. While these changes made huge strides in allowing Americans with disabilities to lead normal lives, they didn’t address the 1938 federal law that allows businesses to pay less than minimum wage in some cases. As part of the law, employers apply for a waiver from the US Department of Labor seeking permission to pay a disabled worker less than the full minimum. They must show evidence that the worker’s mental or physical disability impairs their ability to do the job. For example, if it takes the disabled worker twice as long to do a task than it does for a worker without disabilities, they could pay the disabled worker half the minimum wage.Disability rights advocates have been pushing back against this practice. They want the federal government to prioritize services that focus on independence and integration over the isolation of mental institutions or segregated workshops. About 13 percent of Americans have mental or physical disabilities, and they are far less likely to work than the average American. Even so, 36 percent of Americans with disabilities had jobs in 2016 (among those who are of working age and not living in institutions), according to a recent report from the Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire.Advocates have been pressuring states to ban the subminimum wage, but only three have so far. New Hampshire was the first state to outlaw it in 2015, followed by Maryland in 2016 and Alaska in 2018. Banning the practice at the federal level would be a major victory, essentially outlawing the subminimum wage everywhere. Under the law, the Department of Labor would immediately stop issuing new waivers to employers. Those that already have them would need to gradually raise wages each year so they are paying the full $15 minimum wage by 2026. There has been little pushback from employers who pay workers less than the minimum wage, likely because these workers make up such a small part of the workforce. The Raise the Wage Act is not perfect; there are millions of low-wage workers who get a zero percent pay increase under the law. That’s because federal labor laws exempt so many workers from these types of protections.It’s important to keep in mind that minimum wage laws enshrined in the Fair Labor Standard Act do not cover all workers, including those in the gig economy. Under federal law, businesses do not need to pay independent contractors and freelancers the minimum wage or overtime. Think Uber drivers and Instacart employees.The Fair Labor Standards Act also excludes farmworkers and housekeepers from the right to earn the minimum wage or get overtime pay. They were excluded as a concession to Southern lawmakers, whose states were highly invested in paying low wages to these groups of workers. At the time, that workforce was overwhelmingly black and Latinx, and excluding them from a minimum wage was intentional. Today, about a quarter of farmworkers and 67 percent of housekeepers earn less than the minimum wage.All this goes to show why a $15 minimum wage is the most obvious solution to lift millions of families out of poverty. The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimates that the Raise the Wage Act could boost the paychecks of 40 million workers.The chances of passing the law in the Democratic-controlled House are pretty good. The challenge will be to get enough Republican senators on board with the idea. In the past, GOP lawmakers have been overwhelmingly resistant to changing the minimum wage. But it’s getting harder for them to make the case that businesses will raise wages on their own.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.",2767,2744
21,Drinking Age - Lower It,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?,1s21q5r,https://wqad.com/2014/07/16/should-the-u-s-lower-its-drinking-age/,Should the U.S. lower its drinking age? | WQAD.com,"Editor’s note: This story is part of a series on the 30th anniversary of the National Minimum Age Drinking Act, passed by Congress on July 17, 1984.(CNN) — Dwight B. Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people.When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6.No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals.By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision.Related: Experts say legal ages to drive, and to drink, should be switched“In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.”Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states — and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 — that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age — or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries — Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others — with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.“I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.“The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.”MADD about underage drinkingTwo generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 — or owning an ID that says you are — to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer?By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol — effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 — a bigger decline than for older age groups.“Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year, while MADD calls the legislation “one of the nation’s most important and lifesaving laws.”A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury.The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age.A stalled movementThere’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president.Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.”“Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week.“It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.”Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere.“We missed our moment,” he said.Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far.Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18.“There isn’t much appetite to change something that appears to be working,” said Martinic of ICAP. “It’s not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It’s pretty much a no go.”But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government.And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit — not unlike a driver’s license — upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.Do you think the drinking age in the U.S. should be lowered?

The other two human cases occurred in October 2017 in New Jersey and in August 2017 in Texas. Those cases reported drinking raw milk from an online retailer and a Texas farm, respectively. In addition to these three confirmed cases, hundreds of others were potentially exposed to the bacteria during these three incidents.Initial symptoms of brucellosis can include fever, sweats, loss of appetite, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and potentially more serious complications.In pregnant patients, Brucella infections can lead to miscarriage. Symptoms can start anywhere from five days to six months after exposure.People who are infected but are not treated can go on to develop more serious complications like arthritis; heart problems; enlargement of the spleen or liver; and, in rare cases, nervous system problems, like meningitis.Raw milk and raw milk products are those that have not undergone a process called pasteurization that kills disease-causing germs.Brucella is a live, weakened strain used in a vaccine to protect cows against a more severe form of Brucella infection that can cause abortions in cows and severe illness in people.On rare occasions, cows vaccinated with RB51 vaccine can shed the bacteria in their milk. People who drink raw milk from cows that are shedding RB51 can develop brucellosis.This Brucella strain is resistant to rifampin, one of the antibiotics that would typically be used to prevent or treat brucellosis. CDC recommends that anyone who may have been exposed to RB51 go to their doctor to see if they need antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms from developing.People who consumed raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm since January 2016 may have been exposed and should talk to their doctor.People who are still within six months of the date they last consumed the raw milk are at an increased risk for brucellosis and should receive antibiotics to prevent infection and symptoms, and should monitor their health for possible symptoms for six months. If symptoms develop, they should see their doctor immediately for testing.People who last drank raw milk from this dairy more than six months ago and have had symptoms of brucellosis - but not been treated - should see their doctor immediately for testing that can determine if they are infected and need antibiotics to prevent long-term health problems caused by brucellosis.Discard any leftover or stored raw milk or raw milk products from this dairy farm.As of January 22, 2019, investigators have determined that people in 19 states have bought or consumed raw milk from the implicated farm. The states are Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.This afternoon the last sedan was dropped off at Sweeney Chevrolet on Market Street.

8,Obesity a Disease,Is Obesity a Disease?,1s8q7r,http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/should-we-treat-obesity-contagious-disease,Should we treat obesity like a contagious disease? | Science | AAAS,"BOSTON—Becoming obese isn’t like catching a cold, but a handful of research groups are now trying to model obesity in a population by treating it like a “social contagion” that spreads among people through their interactions. Statistician David Allison and information scientist Keisuke Ejima of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and mathematician Diana Thomas of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, have been working on refining such obesity models. They explained their progress in a session today at the annual meeting of AAAS, which publishes Science. We caught up with them to learn more. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Q: How did this idea of modeling obesity as a contagion come about? K. E.: The first paper was published in 2007 by [Nicholas] Christakis and [James] Fowler. … They found that the obesity can be transmissible through social networks. During my Ph.D. course, I was working on mathematical modeling of infectious disease. When I read their paper, I thought, “I can apply my mathematical techniques to describe the obesity epidemic model.” Q: In what way is obesity a “social contagion”? D. T.: If you’re somebody who loves to go to the gym and loves to eat healthy, it’s unlikely that you’re going to draw in a circle of friends that love to smoke cigarettes and love to eat at fast food restaurants. You’re going to kind of surround yourself and emulate the behavior of a cluster around you. There is some experimental evidence for that. D. A.: I want to just be clear that actually there is a hypothesis out there, supported by some data, that certain microbes—particularly adenoviruses—do contribute to obesity, and in that sense, it would be contagious in the more literal sense of spreading viruses from one person to another. So we don’t want to dismiss that. Q: What factors go into your model, and what does it predict? D. A.: What we’re saying is a population that had these characteristics would start to have these obesity rates. [The model is] a series of interrelated equations, and they include several factors. One is a genetic factor. … We include another term [in the equation] for nongenetic transmission of obesity from mother to offspring, because there’s some evidence that the more obese the mother is, the more obese the offspring will be, irrespective of what she transmits genetically. Then another term deals with the overall population prevalence of obesity. … If the prevalence is higher, you run into more people who are obese, and you are more likely to pick it up from them. Q: What kinds of things can these models tell us? D. T.: All the models are indicating that over time, obesity rates will level off … around 35% to 40% [prevalence]. It is believed that obesity rates are leveling off because of the great work we’ve been doing in intervention. But that may not be the case. All of these models are indicating that a plateau is just a natural evolution of the system. Q: Can the models tell us how to reduce obesity? D. A.: Most of these models are, so far, fairly primitive. Our model only includes a single gene—we know that that’s not true. [And] we know that people have different numbers of offspring as a function of their BMI [body mass index, which measures body fat based on height and weight]. Overweight people tend to have more children than nonoverweight people. Only when a model has built in these many factors can we make good predictions and talk about manipulation. … We’re not ready to make public health recommendations. Q: What questions would you like the models to answer? D. A.: Should we intervene with people who are already at the high end of the BMI continuum, because maybe they’ll benefit the most or need it the most? Or should we intervene more broadly because we’ll have a bigger bang for our buck with a bigger population? These kinds of models can help inform those decisions. Q: Are you concerned that describing obesity as a contagion might increase the stigma around it? D. T.: I have a lost a tremendous amount of weight … and when I was classified with obesity, I know people looked at me and said, “Well she’s just fat because she’s lazy and doesn’t want to take care of herself.” What these types of models tell us is there’s more than one reason why someone might end up in that state, and not all of those reasons are in their personal control. D. A.: Obesity is a highly stigmatized condition already. There’s ample data showing that obese people are discriminated against in the job market, in the housing market, [and] with respect to wages. We don’t want to stigmatize anybody further. … That’s where careful messaging has to get out, that this is something that we’re all in together.",1,7,Pro,Neutral,Pro,0,Pro,"['Pro', 'Neutral', 'Pro']","Is Obesity a Disease?

40,Drone Strikes Overseas,Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?,1s40q8r,https://thebulletin.org/2016/06/its-time-for-transparency-in-the-us-lethal-drone-program/,It’s time for transparency in the US lethal drone program - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,"By Rachel Stohl, June 16, 2016During the Obama presidency, the US drone program has been a topic of significant debate, with critics calling into question the program’s overall efficacy and highlighting the threat lethal drones pose to innocent civilians. Civilian casualties have raised a number of legal and ethical questions regarding use of this technology, particularly outside of active combat zones. Central to this debate is the secrecy surrounding the US lethal drone program, including a lack of official information on casualty figures and accountability for mistakes.The United States’ drone program has been responsible for more than 500 strikes in numerous countries where the United States is not engaged in active combat—such as Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen—even though the majority of drone missions overall have been for non-lethal purposes, such as surveillance and reconnaissance. To date, US drone strikes are believed to have resulted in between 500 and 1,000 civilian deaths by some estimates. Estimates of strikes and casualties are all based on unofficial data, as the Obama administration has provided few details on its lethal drone program and has been loathe to acknowledge the extent to which civilians have been injured or killed by US strikes. In a May 2 interview with CNN, Obama commented on increased drone use during his presidency, stating that “It became so easy to use [drones] without thinking through all the ramifications.”Indeed, the United States’ use of armed drones—particularly the use of armed drones outside Iraq, Syria, and other “areas of active hostilities”—has prompted numerous debates about the ethical and strategic implications of unmanned attacks on perceived threats to the United States and US interests. Central to these debates are questions about how lethal drone strikes will shape the use of force in the future.Criticism of the drone program has been based largely on the effectiveness of targeting key terrorist leaders, the use of primarily lethal force to combat terrorism, the propensity for blowback and anti-American sentiment, the erosion of sovereignty, and the potential for lowering the threshold for entering conflict—which could lead toward endless warfare and instability. Indeed, a central criticism is that the US program could prompt other countries to adopt similar practices and take unilateral action against perceived threats—action cloaked in secrecy and lacking a declaration of war—thereby setting a dangerous precedent.Drones are simply platforms that use air-to-surface missiles, such as the Hellfire II, to strike designated targets. These missiles are precise weapons capable of targeting specific individuals. The problems surrounding lethal drone strikes, therefore, are not related to the platform itself—or even to the weapons they fire—but rather stem from the challenges of intelligence collection and use in the United States’ counterterrorism efforts. These challenges may be the consequence of a number of factors, such as an insufficient amount of data, limited data analyses, or a lack of uniform standards for the intelligence required before deciding whether a strike will accomplish desired objectives. The secrecy surrounding the US drone program compounds these challenges and inhibits objective evaluations of the program’s impact and effectiveness.A lack of transparency. The secrecy surrounding the US drone program makes it difficult to undertake assessments about the efficacy of the program and whether the benefits of lethal drones outweigh the risks. These questions are even more pressing as more and more countries seek to adopt similar capabilities for their own security and defense.Since May 2013, the Obama administration has vowed to be more transparent about its drone program. But for three years, the administration has dragged its heels on fulfilling these commitments. Obama has repeatedly acknowledged the importance of transparency, stating that he recognizes this as “a legitimate concern,” but the administration has yet to make significant progress toward addressing this concern and ensuring that the US program rests on an appropriate framework that will allow for greater transparency, responsibility, and accountability.At the Nuclear Security Summit earlier this year, Obama defended the US drone program and the processes by which targeting decisions are made. However, the president also acknowledged that criticism of the program—regarding both the lack of transparency and the number of civilian casualties—has, to a certain extent, been fair, stating that “the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been.”Promising to do better, the president said, “We have to take responsibility when we're not acting appropriately, or where we've just made mistakes even with the best of intentions. And that's what we're going to continue to try to do.” But is the Obama administration succeeding in this regard? With only a few months left in office, the president’s drone record remains mired in secrecy.A poor report card. Congressional intelligence committees are able to review lethal drone strikes conducted by the CIA and Department of Defense after they occur, but publicly the administration has been reluctant to acknowledge the use of lethal drones in foreign countries. The Pentagon generally does not provide detailed information on drone operations, and the CIA doesn’t release information on its strikes. As a result, the administration has rarely disclosed information on the approximate number, location, responsible agency, or death tolls of strikes—even in aggregate numbers. To date, only a few documents about the drone program have been released—including two versions of a 2010 Department of Justice memo on the justification for killing US citizen and radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, and a Department of Justice white paper on the legal framework for using lethal force against Al Qaeda leaders—and those were primarily under court order.In February, the Stimson Center released its drone policy Report Card, which gave an overall grade of D for the administration’s progress toward fulfilling the transparency recommendations of the 2014 Stimson Task Force on U.S. Drone Policy co-chaired by retired General John P. Abizaid, the former head of United States Central Command; and by Rosa Brooks, former counselor to the undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration. The task force called for improving transparency in targeted drone strikes by: acknowledging the use of lethal force in foreign countries, both to Congress and the American public; releasing information on the approximate number of strikes carried out by the military and the CIA (including the general location of strikes, the number of people known to have been killed, the organizational affiliation of those known to have been killed, the number of civilians known to have been killed, and the identities of civilians known to have been killed); and ordering the preparation and public release of a detailed report explaining the legal basis—under both domestic and international law—guiding the US lethal drone program. Unfortunately, few of these steps have yet been taken, despite repeated commitments to do so.Rooted in secrecy. On April 8, during remarks at the University of Chicago, Obama argued that the lack of progress in improving transparency surrounding the US drone program is rooted in the development of the program via covert channels, which plagued it from the start, stating:I think that the way that this got built up through our intelligence and what’s called our Title 50 programs meant that it did not—it wasn’t subject to the same amount of democratic debate as when we are conducting what are called Title 10 Department of Defense conventional operations. And that's done a disservice not only to the public being able to examine where we made mistakes and create corrective action, it’s actually also done a disservice to the incredibly dedicated men and women in intelligence and in operations who perform these operations who are subject to accusations that somehow they're irresponsible and bloodless and going around—blowing up children, which is not the case.To address these concerns, senior administration officials stated in March that the White House intends to work toward greater transparency and release casualty assessments as well as a redacted version of the Presidential Policy Guidance for strikes outside areas of active hostilities. This is a welcome step, but to be effective and meaningful, this information must be publicly available and detailed enough to ensure that an analysis of the US drone program can be undertaken—including the processes through which targeting decisions are made, and the domestic and international legal justifications for these decisions. Casualty assessment data must include information on procedures to conduct post-strike investigations, the criteria used to classify a person as a combatant or a civilian, and the organized armed group to which a deceased individual allegedly belonged. Such data should also disaggregate the data by strike location and date. Finally, the administration should reveal the policies and procedures for compensation/condolence payments when civilians are killed.Setting the standard. The release of this information will ensure an analysis about both the costs and benefits of the US drone program and allow for a more informed public debate. It will also allow for a more realistic discussion with US allies and partners about the strategic impacts and implications of continued and expanded drone use, and address questions and concerns about the de facto standard that the United States is setting globally via its lethal drone program. If the Obama administration released this information, it could improve legitimacy by contributing to greater understanding and encouraging evaluation of the US drone program and its overall effectiveness.The consequences of drone use—the blowback against US personnel and interests, for example—may take decades to materialize. But the use of drones for targeted killings has the potential to shape wars and conflicts in the future, as more countries seek to adopt drone capabilities, without a robust understanding of the potentially negative consequences of secret wars anywhere a country deems necessary. As time runs out for the Obama administration to cement its legacy on drones, the administration must adhere to its commitments for greater transparency and ensure that the US lethal drone program supports strategic interests as well as national values and foreign policy ideals.

It’s time for transparency in the US lethal drone program - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists By Rachel Stohl, June 16, 2016During the Obama presidency, the US drone program has been a topic of significant debate, with critics calling into question the program’s overall efficacy and highlighting the threat lethal drones pose to innocent civilians. Civilian casualties have raised a number of legal and ethical questions regarding use of this technology, particularly outside of active combat zones. Central to this debate is the secrecy surrounding the US lethal drone program, including a lack of official information on casualty figures and accountability for mistakes.The United States’ drone program has been responsible for more than 500 strikes in numerous countries where the United States is not engaged in active combat—such as Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen—even though the majority of drone missions overall have been for non-lethal purposes, such as surveillance and reconnaissance. To date, US drone strikes are believed to have resulted in between 500 and 1,000 civilian deaths by some estimates. Estimates of strikes and casualties are all based on unofficial data, as the Obama administration has provided few details on its lethal drone program and has been loathe to acknowledge the extent to which civilians have been injured or killed by US strikes. In a May 2 interview with CNN, Obama commented on increased drone use during his presidency, stating that “It became so easy to use [drones] without thinking through all the ramifications.”Indeed, the United States’ use of armed drones—particularly the use of armed drones outside Iraq, Syria, and other “areas of active hostilities”—has prompted numerous debates about the ethical and strategic implications of unmanned attacks on perceived threats to the United States and US interests. Central to these debates are questions about how lethal drone strikes will shape the use of force in the future.Criticism of the drone program has been based largely on the effectiveness of targeting key terrorist leaders, the use of primarily lethal force to combat terrorism, the propensity for blowback and anti-American sentiment, the erosion of sovereignty, and the potential for lowering the threshold for entering conflict—which could lead toward endless warfare and instability. Indeed, a central criticism is that the US program could prompt other countries to adopt similar practices and take unilateral action against perceived threats—action cloaked in secrecy and lacking a declaration of war—thereby setting a dangerous precedent.Drones are simply platforms that use air-to-surface missiles, such as the Hellfire II, to strike designated targets. These missiles are precise weapons capable of targeting specific individuals. The problems surrounding lethal drone strikes, therefore, are not related to the platform itself—or even to the weapons they fire—but rather stem from the challenges of intelligence collection and use in the United States’ counterterrorism efforts. These challenges may be the consequence of a number of factors, such as an insufficient amount of data, limited data analyses, or a lack of uniform standards for the intelligence required before deciding whether a strike will accomplish desired objectives. The secrecy surrounding the US drone program compounds these challenges and inhibits objective evaluations of the program’s impact and effectiveness.A lack of transparency. The secrecy surrounding the US drone program makes it difficult to undertake assessments about the efficacy of the program and whether the benefits of lethal drones outweigh the risks. These questions are even more pressing as more and more countries seek to adopt similar capabilities for their own security and defense.Since May 2013, the Obama administration has vowed to be more transparent about its drone program. But for three years, the administration has dragged its heels on fulfilling these commitments. Obama has repeatedly acknowledged the importance of transparency, stating that he recognizes this as “a legitimate concern,” but the administration has yet to make significant progress toward addressing this concern and ensuring that the US program rests on an appropriate framework that will allow for greater transparency, responsibility, and accountability.At the Nuclear Security Summit earlier this year, Obama defended the US drone program and the processes by which targeting decisions are made. However, the president also acknowledged that criticism of the program—regarding both the lack of transparency and the number of civilian casualties—has, to a certain extent, been fair, stating that “the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been.”Promising to do better, the president said, “We have to take responsibility when we're not acting appropriately, or where we've just made mistakes even with the best of intentions. And that's what we're going to continue to try to do.” But is the Obama administration succeeding in this regard? With only a few months left in office, the president’s drone record remains mired in secrecy.A poor report card. Congressional intelligence committees are able to review lethal drone strikes conducted by the CIA and Department of Defense after they occur, but publicly the administration has been reluctant to acknowledge the use of lethal drones in foreign countries. The Pentagon generally does not provide detailed information on drone operations, and the CIA doesn’t release information on its strikes. As a result, the administration has rarely disclosed information on the approximate number, location, responsible agency, or death tolls of strikes—even in aggregate numbers. To date, only a few documents about the drone program have been released—including two versions of a 2010 Department of Justice memo on the justification for killing US citizen and radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, and a Department of Justice white paper on the legal framework for using lethal force against Al Qaeda leaders—and those were primarily under court order.In February, the Stimson Center released its drone policy Report Card, which gave an overall grade of D for the administration’s progress toward fulfilling the transparency recommendations of the 2014 Stimson Task Force on U.S. Drone Policy co-chaired by retired General John P. Abizaid, the former head of United States Central Command; and by Rosa Brooks, former counselor to the undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration. The task force called for improving transparency in targeted drone strikes by: acknowledging the use of lethal force in foreign countries, both to Congress and the American public; releasing information on the approximate number of strikes carried out by the military and the CIA (including the general location of strikes, the number of people known to have been killed, the organizational affiliation of those known to have been killed, the number of civilians known to have been killed, and the identities of civilians known to have been killed); and ordering the preparation and public release of a detailed report explaining the legal basis—under both domestic and international law—guiding the US lethal drone program.

But as Olvin Hernandez stood behind a fence that walled him off from the rest of the city, he realized he might face a different path.Hernandez, 21, is among the hundreds whose fate remained unknown Monday after more than 1,000 Central American asylum-seekers were allowed to leave a former factory that’s been a temporary facility for the group since they arrived earlier this month. The facility, guarded by Mexican security forces, is scheduled to close this week after housing an estimated 1,600 Central America migrants who had hoped to seek asylum in the United States.As armed state and federal police in riot gear stood watch, Hernandez said he was lied to.“They said they were going to help us get to the bridge. That’s what [the Mexican officials] told us in Saltillo,” he said, referring to the capital of the Mexican state of Coahuila where he and hundreds of others boarded buses earlier this month. “They brought us here and from here we’re trapped. They didn’t explain why they denied [my visa]. They just did.”The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.Hernandez fears he could be deported back to Nicaragua if he's not granted a visa. Some migrants have been given a yearlong, renewable visa that allows them to work and move freely through Mexico. Others have been given a temporary permit which they said is valid for up to 30 days but doesn't allow them to work. Migrants said those temporary permits were issued mainly to allow for more time to process their visa applications. Only a handful, about 12 a day, have been allowed to seek asylum in the United States, the Associated Press reported Saturday.Mexican officials, including federal police and social workers, would not comment on what could happen to the migrants who don't receive visas, saying they lacked permission. The press has been denied entry to the shelter, but reporters have been allowed to talk to the migrants through the fencing.The abandoned factory was converted into a makeshift shelter this month when the group of migrants came to this border town looking to escape violence in their native countries and seek refuge in the U.S. The facility has become just one of the latest flashpoints in the U.S. immigration debate. Last week, President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency on the southern border to fund his long-promised border wall. During his State of the Union speech earlier this month, the president invoked the caravan as a reason the country needed the barrier.The caravan was the latest in a surge of arrivals that began in earnest in 2014, when a record number of unaccompanied minors and family units — mainly women and their minor children — entered Texas illegally through the Rio Grande Valley. The surge has continued and includes several adult males, some of whom are also traveling with their young sons or daughters. Since Trump took office in 2017, his administration has implemented policies aimed at reducing the amount of asylum-seekers.Although foreigners have a right to apply for asylum, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials have been stationed at ports of entry on the U.S.-Mexico border to turn back migrants who don’t have permission to enter the country, telling them to wait in Mexico. CBP officers have justified the move by saying the agency has limited space to house asylum-seekers while they wait for their claims to be processed.Immigrant rights groups have argued the policies have increased tensions in Mexican border towns that are already prone to violence. Late last year, Customs and Border Protection officials used tear gas in two incidents after migrants seeking asylum in Tijuana, Mexico, attempted to illegally enter the United States. Last week, a group of migrants in Piedras Negras confronted Mexican law enforcement and tried to tear down some of the protective barriers lining the perimeter of the facility.

But the other offering is a 30-day permit that doesn’t allow employment.“If they give us permission to leave, we’ll stay in Piedras Negras [for the 30 days],” she said. That will give more time for Mexican immigration officials to process her visa. If it’s denied, her only option could be returning to Honduras.“What am I going to do in Piedras Negras?” she said.Since the caravan arrived earlier this month, U.S. Border Patrol agents and some Texas Department of Public Safety officers have been stationed along the Rio Grande's northern banks, attempting to thwart migrants who might cross the river and turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. With the caravan’s numbers dwindling, however, some migrants said they might wait it out and try later.It’s unclear how many migrants who were part of the caravan have tried to cross the Rio Grande. A spokesperson with the Del Rio Sector of the U.S. Border Patrol, which includes Eagle Pass, didn’t immediately respond to an email Monday.

11,Prescription Drug Ads,Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?,2s11q7r,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arleneweintraub/2018/08/28/you-may-start-seeing-drug-prices-in-ads-but-will-you-understand-the-point/,"You May Start Seeing Drug Prices In Ads, But Will You Understand The Point?","Most patients pay a lot less than the list price for prescription drugs, raising questions about whether disclosing list prices in direct-to-consumer ads will really have any impact on skyrockenting drug costs. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)Late last week, the U.S. Senate passed an amendment to the spending bill that would require pharma companies to disclose the prices of any products they advertise directly to consumers. The package devotes $1 million in funding to implement the new requirement, which co-sponsoring Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) believes will be vital for bringing “transparency to drug pricing and educating the public about the cost of their prescriptions,” he said in a statement.This idea has been floating around since early May, when President Donald Trump suggested it as a way to lower prescription drug costs. Shortly after that, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb acknowledged he had put together a working group to examine the intricacies of implementing such a requirement.But questions abound, not the least of which is this: Which price would drug makers be required to disclose in their direct-to-consumer (DTC) ads? Would it be the list prices that are provided to insurers, the price they pay after rebates or the suggested retail price? Regardless of what the answer ends up being, there’s the nagging question of whether this information would actually mean anything to consumers, or if it would just confuse them, considering the fact that their actual out-of-pocket price would be set by their health insurer. For now, the most popular idea is to include the list prices of drugs in ads. For the world’s top-selling drug, AbbVie’s Humira for rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases, that would be an estimated $50,000 a year or so. And it’s a number viewers could see quite often: More than 6,000 TV ads for Humira have run in the last month alone, according to real-time ad tracker iSpot.TV.Despite the fact that few consumers actually pay full prices for drugs, there’s significant support for the idea of providing some information about cost in DTC ads. Last year, the American Medical Association adopted a policy calling on prescription drug manufacturers to include the suggested retail price in drug ads, suggesting it would offer a way to bring attention to rapidly rising costs.“Sunlight is needed to help respond to price shifts, because if the pricing trends continue, patients and communities will not be able to afford life-saving drugs,” said now AMA President Barbara McAneny, M.D., in a statement.The “sunlight” concept has long been attractive to Grassley. He authored the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires drug and device companies to disclose payments they make to doctors. The idea was to encourage self-policing in the industry, fueled by a desire to not have to disclose transactions that could be viewed as conflicts of interest.A similar pattern of thinking is at work with the drug-price proposal. “What Senator Grassley and I wanted to do is to give the American people more information about drug costs,” said the co-sponsor of the newly passed amendment, Dick Durbin (D-IL), in the statement. “More information gives transparency to the transaction, and will help give American consumers a break and start to slow down the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs.”The idea seems to have broad support from the public, too. In late June, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a poll showing that 76% of people think the federal government should require drug manufacturers to disclose pricing information in ads. About half of respondents who said they had requested prescriptions for advertised drugs reported that their physicians did talk to them about cost issues.But would price disclosure in DTC drug ads really bring down the prices of prescription drugs, as Durbin suggests? There certainly is not a linear relationship between disclosure and behavior change in this case, considering that a $50,000 drug may only cost the average consumer a couple hundred of dollars per year in co-pays.As for the list prices that payers like pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) are faced with, it’s unclear if any of Trump’s proposals are really having an impact.

2,Euthanasia & Assisted Suicide,Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?,1s2q8r,https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/should-physician-assisted-suicide-be-legal-in-every-state/,Should Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal in Every State? - The New York Times,"Questions about issues in the news for students 13 and older.Doctors are supposed to save lives, right? But what if someone’s death is imminent, and no medical intervention can change that fact? Should doctors be allowed to help patients die on their own terms? It’s already legal in five states, including Oregon and Vermont. Should physician-assisted suicide be legal in every state?“Room for Debate” recently asked about expanding the right to die, and a panel of experts weighed in. Below, we share excerpts from three different positions on the issue:Thaddeus Mason Pope, the director of the Health Law Institute at Hamline University, writes:Since the Oregon Death with Dignity Act was enacted in 1997, more than 1,100 people have obtained life-ending prescriptions, and about 750 used them. Most were dying of cancer. And most feared a loss of autonomy, dignity and decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable.These and other statistics on Oregon’s experience are available, because of neutral data collection and reporting. This has permitted legislatures and courts around the world to assess Oregon’s experience. Overwhelmingly, they have found it worthwhile.In significant part, this is due to many safeguards in Oregon’s law, which only allows participation by defined categories of patients. Patients must be mentally healthy residents of Oregon, 18 or older, who have had two physicians determine that they have no more than six months to live.Ira Byock, a professor at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine, writes:… It is not surprising that support for physician-assisted suicide is also rising. The age-old dictum that doctors must not kill patients can appear antiquated, out of touch with hard realities, and even heartless.On the contrary, this is when such principles are most important. Principles are the I-beams of civilization’s architecture, designed to withstand the forces of social upheaval. Prohibitions on medical practice protect vulnerable patients and the public from the power that doctors wield due to their specialized knowledge and skills. People who are poor, or old and frail, or simply have long-standing disabilities, may worry that when they become acutely ill, doctors might see their lives as not worth living and compassionately act to end their supposed misery.Sandeep Jauhar, a cardiologist, writes:In the debate over how to treat people near the end of their lives, allowing assisted suicide is a relatively extreme position. It is much more reasonable — and relevant for most people — to limit aggressive treatments for our sickest and most elderly citizens. In America, unfortunately, even this position can seem extreme. Students: Read all three pieces in full, then tell us…— Should physician-assisted suicide be legal in every state? Do terminally ill people have a right to die on their own terms? — Do doctors who help patients die violate the most basic principles of their profession? Or, are they respecting their patients’ autonomy and helping them avoid needless suffering?— As Dr. Jauhar writes, should we rethink how our medical system treats people in the last six months of their lives?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name.Comments are no longer being accepted.I think that physician-assisted suicide should be available and legal in all states, because people have the right to decide how they want to die. It’s completely up to the patient if he/she wants to try every option of treatment of just die a peaceful, painless death. Doctors don’t violate their principles; they enforce them. The basic principles of their profession is doing everything they can for their patients, and doing what’s best for them. Sometimes assisted suicide is what a patient wants, and is the most humane thing to do, and the doctor should respect that. In the last 6 months of someone’s life, patients usually try to exhaust every treatment option that would extend their lives, and these are usually very aggressive. The better decision for elderly or terminally ill people would be to give them the decision to end their lives on their own terms, as opposed to long, harsh treatments that may potentially fail.Terminally patients do have a right to die on their own terms, everyone should have the right. However, I don’t think it should be through medically assisted suicide. They should stop aggressive treatments, stopping them will slowly lead to death. Even though you were said to have 6 months to live, you could end up having more time. Or there could be experimental treatments. Miracles like this happen all the time. Doctors are taught and supposed to both never kill a patient but also respect patients wishes. Assisted suicide puts them in a tough decision. Since the patients have total control over this though, they must administer the medicine to kill them themselves. So technically, doctors are respecting patients wishes and not directly killing them. Just because someone has been given 6 months to live, it doesn’t mean doctors should all the sudden start exprerimental treatments. They should be doing those throughout their illness. Assisted suicide shouldn’t be what terminally ill people look forward to so they no longer suffer, there is always the small chance they will live.Every state should have assisted suicide. If someone is in so much pain that they feel the need to end their suffering you should let them. Terminally ill people should have the right to put themselves down, if they feel as if it’s the right thing to do for themselves. Doctors who help their patients die do not violate the principles of their profession. One of the basic profession as a doctor is to save their patients. They can save their patients by helping them commit suicide.I Think That The Doctors Are Under Pressure When A Patient ask For something that Extraordinary.I believe assisted suicide is very humans and is a sensible decision for people, like cancer patients, who suffer so much or are in a coma. Imagine being told you’ll die in a few weeks and having to wait, while suffering greatly, for your death. Isn’t it very scary? Wouldn’t you prefer to just die peacefully if death is inevitable? Some people think that legalising euthanasia is bad because anybody who is sick will opt to die, but that’s not the case. For you to end your life through euthanasia you would need to fill out forms, applications, get permission from doctors etc, so it is not that easy.Terminally ill people should not have the rights to die by suicidal medicine. This will get carried on into the future for extreme means no matter how much people say, and politicians promise, it won’t. Humans have always twisted good purposes for the worse. Look at everything that is considered “bad” today, and they all often had a great purpose behind them in the beginning. Doctors save lives, not help patients die. There are always chances for a human to survive as long as they’re breathing.I think dying on one’s own terms should be like in the movie, “Soylent Green”, when any adult could choose when and how to die on his own terms for his own reasons. However, since I highly doubt that philosophy will go over well in the foreseeable future, we could at the very least allow terminally ill people and people suffering excruciating pain with no end in sight the opportunity to die a painless death when they choose to do so.I think the most overlooked question is; Why are so many people offended by and/or opposed to, an individual they have never met, being allowed to end his own suffering? Those opposed to Assisted Suicide are generally opposed to suicide in general. Why is that, I wonder? If safeguards are in place, which they clearly are, that removes the cliche’ and over used excuse of people will just kill off Mee-Maw, claiming she wished to die, to gain an inheritance. I hope those vehemently opposed to assisted suicide have a long time to rethink their stance at some point in the future, preferably during the long months they are forcibly kept alive when death is imminent and continue to suffer a painful death. Perhaps they will consider doing the right thing then and publicly recant, which of course might help others evade that same dreadful fate.I believe that states should all have the right to decide whether physician-assisted suicide be legal. I do not think that it should be left up to national government. I am personally in favor of it. Although I have no experience with people who have had or wished for the option, I can confidently say that if I was facing imminent death with a loss of autonomy, dignity and decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable, I would unquestionably want to take the route of physician-assisted suicide. Being conscious of near death but being unable to take advantage of my remaining life would be mentally excruciating for me. The constitution states that American’s have the right to life, and therefore they have the right to end it if they so please. Doctors who help patients die are not violating, but following the most basic principles of their profession; to keep their patients as comfortable as possible. When there is no possibility of comfort and humiliation is inevitable, they are helping the patient by avoiding needless suffering. I agree with Dr. Jauhar’s philosophy that we should limit aggressive treatments for our people in the last six months of their lives. Instead of inflicting pain to gain a relatively small amount of time a patient is conscious, the medical system should focus on making their last few moments as enjoyable as possible. The length of a life is not nearly as important as the quality of it, and it is wrong to sacrifice quality for longevity.Physician assisted suicide should absolutely be legal in all 50 states. If a patient who is terminally ill wants to end their life on their own terms then they should have the option to do that. Its their body, they are the only ones who have the right to their futures so they should be able to do what they please. Doctors are not violating their principles. Doctors jobs are to be responsive to their patients needs, and if the patient feels the need to end their life then it is the doctors duty to assist them with that. In peoples last months of their lives typically they resort to using the most aggressive treatments to try to extend their time on earth. I have personally seen how people can die peacefully with the assistance of hospice care but in some cases people are in extreme pain and have every right to end their life. Its a very personal decision and people have the right to make their own choices.In the United States, I think that anybody should have ability to have physician aided suicided if they are eligible in regards to certain standards. In Oregon currently, you must be 18 or older, and agree three times to continue with the process (twice verbally, once written). Also a physician must approve that you are terminally ill and will most likely die within six months of the aided suicide. All of the precautions are definitely needed for something of this nature ever wants to become more universal. For example if a person in not mentally sane, or under the influence, the physician aided suicide should not be available. I think it is important be able to give people the choice if they feel that they are in pain, or uncomfortable, or if they feel that they are missing out on common human activities. Does a doctor who aids in a suicide go against what he or she has been trained to do? Doctors in general are supposed to help people, if a person is in pain and it cannot be treated any further, the best thing to do is to just call it, which would help the person in pain be relieved. People may argue that this is inhumane because it could most definitely be seen that way. The very people who are trained and educated on saving people are now ending peoples lifes. If the death wish is only granted if a person is not going to live longer than six months, then why don’t nurses and doctors provide a happier and more fulfilling six months for the patient to enjoy living just a little more before their death. In conclusion, I think it should be more universal but under the same restrictions if not even more than Oregon.In my opinion, Physician assisted suicide should be legal in all states. Many people who have a short life to be lived might not want to put the burden on themselves or even others in their family. The option to end their life peacefully and soundly makes for a very stress free and clean death without having to go through possible pain. Although people may argue that this is just an excuse for doctors to not do their job or to find a quick and easy way out. however this isn’t the case. The doctor does give the patient all the viable and necessary options they should and would be entitled to normally. some of these procedures are never a guarantee and the patients has the ability to stop the death procedure at anytime since the medication is self taken. Although someone only does have 6 months to live they should still be given the best medical treatment available to them during such time to give then a pain free death. Although its not always the case it should be changed so it is. I feel as though if the patient is ill and consents to the death it should be legal and there isn’t a reason it truly shouldn’t be. Its your own life and you should have the decision to suffer or not.As everyone says, “Death is inevitable,” which by far is the most truest statement ever said. We have two choices in our lives, to live or to die. Both are hard, and both take determination, but the only thing similar in these two choices is that eventually we all die. The choice is only in the hands of its beholder, and we may say it is wrong to choose our dying fates, but people die every day: shootings, suicides, uncured diseases, cancer, and apparently those are recognized in today’s society as acceptable, so I believe that assisted suicide should be too. Terminally ill patients are the main focus when it comes to assisted suicide, and to me, that is okay. For them to suffer in misery rather than die by their own wishes is wrong. As people, we would rather keep them alive to be selfish for ourselves and our sanity, but not let them be at peace instead of being poked and probed. These patients are going through the most painful and heartbreaking times of their lives and we should be at least decent enough people to let them go at their own command. Most would consider any doctor a murderer if they assisted a patient or anyone in suicide, but really if a patient is honest and knows what is better for themselves, the doctor is only doing their job and listening to the patients request and no patient should ever be turned down when it comes to their own life. Doctors see patients suffer first-hand through misery and they can tell when someone is hurting, especially since they are the people who put a time limit on someone’s life. Terminally ill patients are literally given an estimated time on how long they have to live, and I think that is worst than assisting them in suicide. If any patient were to ask a doctor to end their lives before their sickness did, I hope the doctor has enough respect and honor towards his or hers patient to do what they asked. As the doctor writes, it is an extreme position for anyone to agree to assisted suicide. Medical laws should be changed to benefit the patient instead of benefiting the companies who supply medicines and treatments that make the human body endure more than it has too. Patients have the right to their body and the medical system should support them instead of the choices of doctors or family members.I think that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state because people should have the right to die on their own terms. As the article said, one of the major ideas behind this is that the patients want to die with their dignity intact, and I believe that this is perfectly reasonable. The doctors aren’t going against their principles, they are merely allowing someone who would have a poor quality of life to end it well.I do think that terminally-ill people have a right to die on their own terms, and I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal. I think people have a right to die on their own terms because it’s their own life, and they should choose how to spend and end it. Also, if they’re terminally ill and they know that they don’t have long to live, why have them filled with uncertainty and fearing death, when they can go out on their own terms. It could also help ease the pain some people would feel because they know the death is coming, and could help end the pain of the patient who has the illness. When doctors help people die, they are not doing anything wrong. If the patient wants to die, then they should be allowed to die, and if they want to live, then the doctor can help them there. A doctor should have no control over their patient’s decisions in their own life because it’s not their choice to make. I don’t think we should rethink how our medical system treats people because it has been fine up to this point, and if there is nothing wrong with the medical system, then why fix it?I think that it should be legal, because it is truly up to the person if they want help from a physician to get a prescription that can end their life, they should be able to get it, although I might not like that it I can’t force what I think on to others. I don’t think that if a doctor were to do this, I don’t think it would violate their principles, because if a person only has a few months left to live, and they’re in severe pain, then they should be able to say whether they want to die now or wait till they actually die.I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state. If someone is terminally ill they should get to choose when and how they want to die. I guess technically the doctors who help their patients die are violating a basic rule, but at the same time they are doing what the patient wants and helping. When someone has a disease or sickness that is causing them pain and suffering and they’re not going to live through it anyway they’re more than likely going to want to avoid the suffering and costly payments. It’s only fair to let the patient not have to suffer for months up until they die, unhealthy, unhappy, and exhausted. We definitely need to rethink how our medical system works and how patients are treated in their last 6 months of life. The fact that physician-assisted suicide is only legal in 5 states is sad in my opinion. Nobody should have to live their last months in pain.Physician-assisted suicide is a controversial subject. There are many people who see it as something wrong and then there are others who are fine with it. Physician-assisted suicide is now legal in only five states, but it should be legal in all 50 states. I do not see anything wrong with having this option for people in every state. It is not something mandatory for all; it is rather just an option. Making physician-assisted suicide legal is a good choice to make because the restrictions that can be applied to it make it safe and beneficial for many. For example, according to the article, in Oregon they only allow patients who are mentally healthy, are residents of Oregon, are 18 or older, and have had at least two or more physicians determine that they have six or less months to live. If all states were to follow the same steps of Oregon, then physician-assisted suicide would not be viewed as something so negative or dangerous and more people would be happy with this choice. If a patient can’t take the pain any more then they should have the right to die on their own terms. A patient cannot be forced to live in “misery”, as the article says, because it is truly sad to see someone suffer. It is an understandable position to make such a choice because there really is no point to be around anymore especially when a patient is aware that they have a limited time to live. It is painful to know that pretty soon they are going to die at any time and not only are they suffering, but their family members are suffering as well. In addition, the patient will only die more counting down the days til their death; it is just something that terminally ill patients shouldn’t have to deal with. Doctors who help patients die are judged a lot of the time because there are people who disagree with this method. Many see doctors who do this as cynical, evil, heartless people, but in reality they are only helping these poor ill people. There are people that say that doctors are in no position to do something like this or they bring religion in this and say that God is the only one who can truly end someone’s life, but if it’s the patient’s choice to do this then the doctor is in no wrong. Also, many of these people who don’t agree with physician-assisted suicide don’t understand the pain that these ill patients go through on a daily basis. These doctors are only respecting their patient’s decision and they can’t just go against it. If the doctor sees that their patient is tired of suffering and always being in pain, they would rather want their patient to be at peace with no more pain then let them keep living in pain until the day they die. As Dr. Jauhar wrote, it would be more reasonable to limit aggressive treatments for the sick patients. There are some medical systems who could care less about their patients and don’t treat them in a fair way. They don’t want what’s best for their patients, and one would think that the medical systems would have sympathy for these patients that have less than 6 months to live, but they don’t. Medical systems should be more caring and respectful to these terminally ill patients. Not all medical systems are like this, but there are also very few who do a good job with how they treat their terminally ill patients. Even if their profession is to poke them with needles and stuff them with medicine, they are still humans themselves and it is only humanitarian if they had a little change of heart towards these ill patients.Humans tend to try live life the fullest extent possible. No human would think about death unless they have something very severe that impedes them to live a normal life. Taking this in consideration I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state and the terminally ill person should have the ultimate decision to end their life. For example, people who are in a coma for a very long time, people who are in vegetative state, people who cannot live without life support or people who have a disease that causes them to live a painful life. All these people might struggle to do normal every day activities such as bathing, cooking, eating, walking, etc. The people who are struggling and suffering might want to end to end their life because there might be no counter agent for their condition. The only way this may be possible for those people is by living in one out of the four states were Physician-assisted suicide is legal. A basic concept that some people may have about doctors is that they are people who have been highly trained in observing people to prescribe the right medication so the patient can recover as soon as possible and live a normal life. It is ironic that a doctor could help his patient die! This defies the basic principles of a doctor, which is to help the people stay healthy so that the patient could be able to live long as possible. However, a doctor who helps his patient with a terminal illness die with his or her consent is just respecting the opinion of someone who is struggling every minute of the patient’s life. The medical system should change the way how the patients are treated. The medical system just wants to get as much money as possible from the patient’s insurance. They prescribe many things to a patient that would not help cure the patient. It would be useless for the patient to consume the medication. If there is no possible cure for the patient then doctor should tell the truth to the patient and respect the opinion of the patient who may choose to live the rest of the life or to end it earlier.I definetly believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in all states. Personally I would rather die while I still could enjoy life, as opposed to being on life support. I do not think suicide is wrong or cowardice, I think a human has the right to die when they please, even if they die by their own hand. One of the bravest men ever to live, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, took his own life not because he was depressed, but because he was happy with where his life was at the time, and that to me is not only brave, but heroic. So if a person has the choice of either killing them self or dying in a way that they feel leaves them no dignity, I say, it is there choice.Physician-assisted suicide should indeed be made legal in every state of the United States of America. Plus, people who are sick and diagnosed with a disease that WILL take their lives should indeed be given the right to die on their own terms. After all, why should the life of the person who is suffering from a disease that is untreatable be forced to live. By doing this, the only way this can be seen as is torture for the one who is suffering in pain.Doctors who help patients die are not violating the most basic principles of their profession. The doctors who assist their patients in committing suicide are only caring for patients health. If the patient is in pain of unending suffering from symptoms that fall under physical, emotional and phycological turmoil. Also, one the basic principles of medical ethics state: A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical care, with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights. This states that a physician shall do their best to serve and respect the patients rights and self-respect. This entitles the physician to respect the patients wish to die should patient be in suffering. With this the doctors who respect the patients wish to do are not violating the most basic principles of their profession, they are but simply obeying them.Our countries medical system must be rethought. When people begin the last six months of their lives on mother earth they must have the right to choose when to ‘pull the plug’. However, the ‘pulling of the plug’ should only be allowed when one is experiencing the untreatable pain for a disease one has.I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal and that terminally ill people have a right to die on their own terms. Since it is their life, they should have a choice, even if they are going to die soon. Doctors who help patients die, do somewhat violate the most basic principles of their profession, but they shouldn’t be called heartless. It is not the doctors’ decision if the patient wants treatment or not. The doctor cannot make a patient live, if they do not want to. I personally think that doctors are somewhat violating the basic principles but cannot do anything about it, and they shouldn’t be punished for the patients actions and decisions. Letting them pass the way they want is respecting their patients’ autonomy and helping them avoid needless suffering. I strongly believe in this statement that it avoids needless suffering and respects their autonomy because they should have a say of how they want to spend their last days, weeks, or months. I agree with Dr. Jauhar and that we should rethink how our medical system treats people in the last six months of their lives because they know that they are going to die and no one can stop it, they should die the way they want, happy and peaceful, instead of stuck in a hospital bed attached to all these machines, trying to be cured that will most likely not be successful. Also, I think that hospitals should try to stop putting in so much money and effort into people who are incurable and should be trying to cure others, that have more of a chance. I am strongly in favor that the patients should have the choice in the way they want their life to end and that even the doctors have no control over it.Physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state. There are a lot of painful sicknesses that people deal with today that may cause them to not enjoy their life. It should not be in the doctor’s or governments hand to decide for their life. They are not physically feeling the pain and emotion that the patient may be going through to say they can not chose to live or die. Terminally ill people should absolutely have the right to chose their fate because they are going to die either way. However, if a patient is sentenced to more than a year to live, they should not be able to make a decision till the last 6 months just as Oregon allows. States that not have made assisted suicide legal should look at Oregon’s results. Oregon has had a success when it comes to assisting people with their death. Also, their procedures of having the patient documentaly write down their wish to die and verbally stating it with 2 witnesses around may help the doctor with any issues of getting sued or blamed in the future. If assisted suicide is what the patient really wants it should be given to them because they have their own rights and freedom. That’s what America is about. Doctor’s that help people die do not violate the basic principles of being a doctor. Sure a doctor is suppose to save as many lives as they can, but their job is to also satisfy the patient and to help them with any pain they may have to be comfortable. When a patient is in need of a surgery the doctor has to ask permission in order to perform that specific task. It is the patients decision whether or not they want to proceed with the surgery or take the chances without it. Any surgery can cause death no matter how small it may be. There is no difference between asking a patient for surgery or a patient asking to end their life because both of those decisions are in their hands to decide. Dr.Jauhar writes about how the treatment of sick people in their last 6 months should be considered. As he says, aggressive treatment should be limited especially to elderly patients. People who have a short limited time to live should not live their last moments hooked on medication or any type of treatment. They should be enjoying themselves, their loved ones, and the world while they still have the chance.Imagine one being so sick that they can barely move a muscle, imagine being so sick where one can barely breathe, imagine being so sick that one wants to take their life away. Terminally ill people should have the right to end their life when they are no longer able to enjoy life. Terminally ill people believe they are never going to get better so taking their life away by a physician-assisted suicide is the best option. I believe physician-assisted suicide should be legal because it helps those who are suffering and those who are terminally ill die peacefully. Patients who are terminally ill know when they can’t live anymore so when doctors conduct a physician assisted suicide all they are doing is helping their patients die peacefully. No one wants to die suffering or live suffering, one would rather die peacefully so physician assisted suicide prevents the case of patients suffering. Doctors who help patients die do not violate their principles of their profession because they are helping their patients be heard, and be free. They are respecting their patients’ requests of not wanting to suffer anymore, if one does not want to live anymore because of pain they should be allowed to have a physician assisted suicide. “Treating” elderly’s with strong medicine that do not help them is wrong, we should definitely rethink our medical system and how we treat people in the last six months of their lives. It is much more reasonable to take a sick elderly’s life with a physician-assisted suicide because I believe they have suffered enough. If a patient is given six months to live, they should have the option to either live the six months or die peacefully. If a patient is suffering in pain, they would most likely choose the option to die peacefully and I believe that is the right choice because no one should suffer, no one should feel like they are unable to enjoy life anymore.Doctors are supposed to save lives. If a patient’s death is imminent and no medical intervention can change the fact, doctors should do what is right by the patient. Doctors should help the dying patient die on their own terms, if the previous statement is true and of course, a few other conditions. Physician-Assisted suicide should be legal in all states. If patients fall under the conditions and circumstances as those under from the Oregon Death with Dignity Act of 1997 and wants to terminate their lives, then there is no reason why they should not be helped. Doctors should try to keep patients alive, but should also do what is right by the patient. Terminally ill patients should have the right to die on their own terms, since their death can’t be stopped. It is irrational for a patient to have to go through the pain of dying and have medical charges added to their name for someone else to pay after they have passed. Doctors are not violating the basic principle of their profession by helping a patient chose death. For example, in Oregon 1,100 patients were given the prescription of death, but only 750 decided to take the prescription. It’s the patient’s choice to decide whether or not to take the prescription. The the 750 cases the doctors were respecting their patient’s anatomy and preventing them from going through unnecessary suffering. I agree with Dr. Jauhar that Physician-Assisted Suicide is an extreme position, but it is just as extreme as having a patient go through needless suffering. Occasionally, some medical systems treat the sickest and oldest patients as if they were at their life’s prime and stuff them with medication and have them undergo intense procedures that may not even work. I know this because I have witnessed this happen to person I knew. It’s best to try to help the patient as much as possible and allow the patient to say when enough is enough. After all, a patient has the right to refuse treatment, at least here in California.I think it should be available in every state cause its your choose if your given six weeks to like and they say the last weeks gonna be the worst you shouldnt have to suffer through it in complete painSign up for our free newsletter.

Should Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal in Every State? - The New York Times Questions about issues in the news for students 13 and older.Doctors are supposed to save lives, right? But what if someone’s death is imminent, and no medical intervention can change that fact? Should doctors be allowed to help patients die on their own terms? It’s already legal in five states, including Oregon and Vermont. Should physician-assisted suicide be legal in every state?“Room for Debate” recently asked about expanding the right to die, and a panel of experts weighed in. Below, we share excerpts from three different positions on the issue:Thaddeus Mason Pope, the director of the Health Law Institute at Hamline University, writes:Since the Oregon Death with Dignity Act was enacted in 1997, more than 1,100 people have obtained life-ending prescriptions, and about 750 used them. Most were dying of cancer. And most feared a loss of autonomy, dignity and decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable.These and other statistics on Oregon’s experience are available, because of neutral data collection and reporting. This has permitted legislatures and courts around the world to assess Oregon’s experience. Overwhelmingly, they have found it worthwhile.In significant part, this is due to many safeguards in Oregon’s law, which only allows participation by defined categories of patients. Patients must be mentally healthy residents of Oregon, 18 or older, who have had two physicians determine that they have no more than six months to live.Ira Byock, a professor at Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine, writes:… It is not surprising that support for physician-assisted suicide is also rising. The age-old dictum that doctors must not kill patients can appear antiquated, out of touch with hard realities, and even heartless.On the contrary, this is when such principles are most important. Principles are the I-beams of civilization’s architecture, designed to withstand the forces of social upheaval. Prohibitions on medical practice protect vulnerable patients and the public from the power that doctors wield due to their specialized knowledge and skills. People who are poor, or old and frail, or simply have long-standing disabilities, may worry that when they become acutely ill, doctors might see their lives as not worth living and compassionately act to end their supposed misery.Sandeep Jauhar, a cardiologist, writes:In the debate over how to treat people near the end of their lives, allowing assisted suicide is a relatively extreme position. It is much more reasonable — and relevant for most people — to limit aggressive treatments for our sickest and most elderly citizens. In America, unfortunately, even this position can seem extreme. Students: Read all three pieces in full, then tell us…— Should physician-assisted suicide be legal in every state? Do terminally ill people have a right to die on their own terms? — Do doctors who help patients die violate the most basic principles of their profession? Or, are they respecting their patients’ autonomy and helping them avoid needless suffering?— As Dr. Jauhar writes, should we rethink how our medical system treats people in the last six months of their lives?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name.Comments are no longer being accepted.I think that physician-assisted suicide should be available and legal in all states, because people have the right to decide how they want to die. It’s completely up to the patient if he/she wants to try every option of treatment of just die a peaceful, painless death. Doctors don’t violate their principles; they enforce them. The basic principles of their profession is doing everything they can for their patients, and doing what’s best for them. Sometimes assisted suicide is what a patient wants, and is the most humane thing to do, and the doctor should respect that. In the last 6 months of someone’s life, patients usually try to exhaust every treatment option that would extend their lives, and these are usually very aggressive. The better decision for elderly or terminally ill people would be to give them the decision to end their lives on their own terms, as opposed to long, harsh treatments that may potentially fail.Terminally patients do have a right to die on their own terms, everyone should have the right. However, I don’t think it should be through medically assisted suicide. They should stop aggressive treatments, stopping them will slowly lead to death. Even though you were said to have 6 months to live, you could end up having more time. Or there could be experimental treatments. Miracles like this happen all the time. Doctors are taught and supposed to both never kill a patient but also respect patients wishes. Assisted suicide puts them in a tough decision. Since the patients have total control over this though, they must administer the medicine to kill them themselves. So technically, doctors are respecting patients wishes and not directly killing them. Just because someone has been given 6 months to live, it doesn’t mean doctors should all the sudden start exprerimental treatments. They should be doing those throughout their illness. Assisted suicide shouldn’t be what terminally ill people look forward to so they no longer suffer, there is always the small chance they will live.Every state should have assisted suicide. If someone is in so much pain that they feel the need to end their suffering you should let them. Terminally ill people should have the right to put themselves down, if they feel as if it’s the right thing to do for themselves. Doctors who help their patients die do not violate the principles of their profession. One of the basic profession as a doctor is to save their patients. They can save their patients by helping them commit suicide.I Think That The Doctors Are Under Pressure When A Patient ask For something that Extraordinary.I believe assisted suicide is very humans and is a sensible decision for people, like cancer patients, who suffer so much or are in a coma. Imagine being told you’ll die in a few weeks and having to wait, while suffering greatly, for your death. Isn’t it very scary? Wouldn’t you prefer to just die peacefully if death is inevitable? Some people think that legalising euthanasia is bad because anybody who is sick will opt to die, but that’s not the case. For you to end your life through euthanasia you would need to fill out forms, applications, get permission from doctors etc, so it is not that easy.Terminally ill people should not have the rights to die by suicidal medicine. This will get carried on into the future for extreme means no matter how much people say, and politicians promise, it won’t. Humans have always twisted good purposes for the worse. Look at everything that is considered “bad” today, and they all often had a great purpose behind them in the beginning. Doctors save lives, not help patients die. There are always chances for a human to survive as long as they’re breathing.I think dying on one’s own terms should be like in the movie, “Soylent Green”, when any adult could choose when and how to die on his own terms for his own reasons. However, since I highly doubt that philosophy will go over well in the foreseeable future, we could at the very least allow terminally ill people and people suffering excruciating pain with no end in sight the opportunity to die a painless death when they choose to do so.I think the most overlooked question is; Why are so many people offended by and/or opposed to, an individual they have never met, being allowed to end his own suffering? Those opposed to Assisted Suicide are generally opposed to suicide in general. Why is that, I wonder? If safeguards are in place, which they clearly are, that removes the cliche’ and over used excuse of people will just kill off Mee-Maw, claiming she wished to die, to gain an inheritance. I hope those vehemently opposed to assisted suicide have a long time to rethink their stance at some point in the future, preferably during the long months they are forcibly kept alive when death is imminent and continue to suffer a painful death. Perhaps they will consider doing the right thing then and publicly recant, which of course might help others evade that same dreadful fate.I believe that states should all have the right to decide whether physician-assisted suicide be legal. I do not think that it should be left up to national government. I am personally in favor of it. Although I have no experience with people who have had or wished for the option, I can confidently say that if I was facing imminent death with a loss of autonomy, dignity and decreasing ability to participate in activities that made life enjoyable, I would unquestionably want to take the route of physician-assisted suicide. Being conscious of near death but being unable to take advantage of my remaining life would be mentally excruciating for me. The constitution states that American’s have the right to life, and therefore they have the right to end it if they so please. Doctors who help patients die are not violating, but following the most basic principles of their profession; to keep their patients as comfortable as possible. When there is no possibility of comfort and humiliation is inevitable, they are helping the patient by avoiding needless suffering. I agree with Dr. Jauhar’s philosophy that we should limit aggressive treatments for our people in the last six months of their lives. Instead of inflicting pain to gain a relatively small amount of time a patient is conscious, the medical system should focus on making their last few moments as enjoyable as possible. The length of a life is not nearly as important as the quality of it, and it is wrong to sacrifice quality for longevity.Physician assisted suicide should absolutely be legal in all 50 states. If a patient who is terminally ill wants to end their life on their own terms then they should have the option to do that. Its their body, they are the only ones who have the right to their futures so they should be able to do what they please. Doctors are not violating their principles. Doctors jobs are to be responsive to their patients needs, and if the patient feels the need to end their life then it is the doctors duty to assist them with that. In peoples last months of their lives typically they resort to using the most aggressive treatments to try to extend their time on earth. I have personally seen how people can die peacefully with the assistance of hospice care but in some cases people are in extreme pain and have every right to end their life. Its a very personal decision and people have the right to make their own choices.In the United States, I think that anybody should have ability to have physician aided suicided if they are eligible in regards to certain standards. In Oregon currently, you must be 18 or older, and agree three times to continue with the process (twice verbally, once written). Also a physician must approve that you are terminally ill and will most likely die within six months of the aided suicide. All of the precautions are definitely needed for something of this nature ever wants to become more universal. For example if a person in not mentally sane, or under the influence, the physician aided suicide should not be available. I think it is important be able to give people the choice if they feel that they are in pain, or uncomfortable, or if they feel that they are missing out on common human activities. Does a doctor who aids in a suicide go against what he or she has been trained to do? Doctors in general are supposed to help people, if a person is in pain and it cannot be treated any further, the best thing to do is to just call it, which would help the person in pain be relieved. People may argue that this is inhumane because it could most definitely be seen that way. The very people who are trained and educated on saving people are now ending peoples lifes. If the death wish is only granted if a person is not going to live longer than six months, then why don’t nurses and doctors provide a happier and more fulfilling six months for the patient to enjoy living just a little more before their death. In conclusion, I think it should be more universal but under the same restrictions if not even more than Oregon.In my opinion, Physician assisted suicide should be legal in all states. Many people who have a short life to be lived might not want to put the burden on themselves or even others in their family. The option to end their life peacefully and soundly makes for a very stress free and clean death without having to go through possible pain. Although people may argue that this is just an excuse for doctors to not do their job or to find a quick and easy way out. however this isn’t the case. The doctor does give the patient all the viable and necessary options they should and would be entitled to normally. some of these procedures are never a guarantee and the patients has the ability to stop the death procedure at anytime since the medication is self taken. Although someone only does have 6 months to live they should still be given the best medical treatment available to them during such time to give then a pain free death. Although its not always the case it should be changed so it is. I feel as though if the patient is ill and consents to the death it should be legal and there isn’t a reason it truly shouldn’t be. Its your own life and you should have the decision to suffer or not.As everyone says, “Death is inevitable,” which by far is the most truest statement ever said. We have two choices in our lives, to live or to die. Both are hard, and both take determination, but the only thing similar in these two choices is that eventually we all die. The choice is only in the hands of its beholder, and we may say it is wrong to choose our dying fates, but people die every day: shootings, suicides, uncured diseases, cancer, and apparently those are recognized in today’s society as acceptable, so I believe that assisted suicide should be too. Terminally ill patients are the main focus when it comes to assisted suicide, and to me, that is okay. For them to suffer in misery rather than die by their own wishes is wrong. As people, we would rather keep them alive to be selfish for ourselves and our sanity, but not let them be at peace instead of being poked and probed. These patients are going through the most painful and heartbreaking times of their lives and we should be at least decent enough people to let them go at their own command. Most would consider any doctor a murderer if they assisted a patient or anyone in suicide, but really if a patient is honest and knows what is better for themselves, the doctor is only doing their job and listening to the patients request and no patient should ever be turned down when it comes to their own life. Doctors see patients suffer first-hand through misery and they can tell when someone is hurting, especially since they are the people who put a time limit on someone’s life. Terminally ill patients are literally given an estimated time on how long they have to live, and I think that is worst than assisting them in suicide. If any patient were to ask a doctor to end their lives before their sickness did, I hope the doctor has enough respect and honor towards his or hers patient to do what they asked. As the doctor writes, it is an extreme position for anyone to agree to assisted suicide. Medical laws should be changed to benefit the patient instead of benefiting the companies who supply medicines and treatments that make the human body endure more than it has too. Patients have the right to their body and the medical system should support them instead of the choices of doctors or family members.I think that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state because people should have the right to die on their own terms. As the article said, one of the major ideas behind this is that the patients want to die with their dignity intact, and I believe that this is perfectly reasonable. The doctors aren’t going against their principles, they are merely allowing someone who would have a poor quality of life to end it well.I do think that terminally-ill people have a right to die on their own terms, and I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal. I think people have a right to die on their own terms because it’s their own life, and they should choose how to spend and end it. Also, if they’re terminally ill and they know that they don’t have long to live, why have them filled with uncertainty and fearing death, when they can go out on their own terms. It could also help ease the pain some people would feel because they know the death is coming, and could help end the pain of the patient who has the illness. When doctors help people die, they are not doing anything wrong. If the patient wants to die, then they should be allowed to die, and if they want to live, then the doctor can help them there. A doctor should have no control over their patient’s decisions in their own life because it’s not their choice to make. I don’t think we should rethink how our medical system treats people because it has been fine up to this point, and if there is nothing wrong with the medical system, then why fix it?I think that it should be legal, because it is truly up to the person if they want help from a physician to get a prescription that can end their life, they should be able to get it, although I might not like that it I can’t force what I think on to others. I don’t think that if a doctor were to do this, I don’t think it would violate their principles, because if a person only has a few months left to live, and they’re in severe pain, then they should be able to say whether they want to die now or wait till they actually die.I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state. If someone is terminally ill they should get to choose when and how they want to die. I guess technically the doctors who help their patients die are violating a basic rule, but at the same time they are doing what the patient wants and helping. When someone has a disease or sickness that is causing them pain and suffering and they’re not going to live through it anyway they’re more than likely going to want to avoid the suffering and costly payments. It’s only fair to let the patient not have to suffer for months up until they die, unhealthy, unhappy, and exhausted. We definitely need to rethink how our medical system works and how patients are treated in their last 6 months of life. The fact that physician-assisted suicide is only legal in 5 states is sad in my opinion. Nobody should have to live their last months in pain.Physician-assisted suicide is a controversial subject. There are many people who see it as something wrong and then there are others who are fine with it. Physician-assisted suicide is now legal in only five states, but it should be legal in all 50 states. I do not see anything wrong with having this option for people in every state. It is not something mandatory for all; it is rather just an option. Making physician-assisted suicide legal is a good choice to make because the restrictions that can be applied to it make it safe and beneficial for many. For example, according to the article, in Oregon they only allow patients who are mentally healthy, are residents of Oregon, are 18 or older, and have had at least two or more physicians determine that they have six or less months to live. If all states were to follow the same steps of Oregon, then physician-assisted suicide would not be viewed as something so negative or dangerous and more people would be happy with this choice. If a patient can’t take the pain any more then they should have the right to die on their own terms. A patient cannot be forced to live in “misery”, as the article says, because it is truly sad to see someone suffer. It is an understandable position to make such a choice because there really is no point to be around anymore especially when a patient is aware that they have a limited time to live. It is painful to know that pretty soon they are going to die at any time and not only are they suffering, but their family members are suffering as well. In addition, the patient will only die more counting down the days til their death; it is just something that terminally ill patients shouldn’t have to deal with. Doctors who help patients die are judged a lot of the time because there are people who disagree with this method. Many see doctors who do this as cynical, evil, heartless people, but in reality they are only helping these poor ill people. There are people that say that doctors are in no position to do something like this or they bring religion in this and say that God is the only one who can truly end someone’s life, but if it’s the patient’s choice to do this then the doctor is in no wrong. Also, many of these people who don’t agree with physician-assisted suicide don’t understand the pain that these ill patients go through on a daily basis. These doctors are only respecting their patient’s decision and they can’t just go against it. If the doctor sees that their patient is tired of suffering and always being in pain, they would rather want their patient to be at peace with no more pain then let them keep living in pain until the day they die. As Dr. Jauhar wrote, it would be more reasonable to limit aggressive treatments for the sick patients. There are some medical systems who could care less about their patients and don’t treat them in a fair way. They don’t want what’s best for their patients, and one would think that the medical systems would have sympathy for these patients that have less than 6 months to live, but they don’t. Medical systems should be more caring and respectful to these terminally ill patients. Not all medical systems are like this, but there are also very few who do a good job with how they treat their terminally ill patients. Even if their profession is to poke them with needles and stuff them with medicine, they are still humans themselves and it is only humanitarian if they had a little change of heart towards these ill patients.Humans tend to try live life the fullest extent possible. No human would think about death unless they have something very severe that impedes them to live a normal life. Taking this in consideration I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state and the terminally ill person should have the ultimate decision to end their life. For example, people who are in a coma for a very long time, people who are in vegetative state, people who cannot live without life support or people who have a disease that causes them to live a painful life. All these people might struggle to do normal every day activities such as bathing, cooking, eating, walking, etc. The people who are struggling and suffering might want to end to end their life because there might be no counter agent for their condition. The only way this may be possible for those people is by living in one out of the four states were Physician-assisted suicide is legal. A basic concept that some people may have about doctors is that they are people who have been highly trained in observing people to prescribe the right medication so the patient can recover as soon as possible and live a normal life. It is ironic that a doctor could help his patient die! This defies the basic principles of a doctor, which is to help the people stay healthy so that the patient could be able to live long as possible. However, a doctor who helps his patient with a terminal illness die with his or her consent is just respecting the opinion of someone who is struggling every minute of the patient’s life. The medical system should change the way how the patients are treated. The medical system just wants to get as much money as possible from the patient’s insurance. They prescribe many things to a patient that would not help cure the patient. It would be useless for the patient to consume the medication. If there is no possible cure for the patient then doctor should tell the truth to the patient and respect the opinion of the patient who may choose to live the rest of the life or to end it earlier.I definetly believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal in all states. Personally I would rather die while I still could enjoy life, as opposed to being on life support. I do not think suicide is wrong or cowardice, I think a human has the right to die when they please, even if they die by their own hand. One of the bravest men ever to live, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, took his own life not because he was depressed, but because he was happy with where his life was at the time, and that to me is not only brave, but heroic. So if a person has the choice of either killing them self or dying in a way that they feel leaves them no dignity, I say, it is there choice.Physician-assisted suicide should indeed be made legal in every state of the United States of America. Plus, people who are sick and diagnosed with a disease that WILL take their lives should indeed be given the right to die on their own terms. After all, why should the life of the person who is suffering from a disease that is untreatable be forced to live. By doing this, the only way this can be seen as is torture for the one who is suffering in pain.Doctors who help patients die are not violating the most basic principles of their profession. The doctors who assist their patients in committing suicide are only caring for patients health. If the patient is in pain of unending suffering from symptoms that fall under physical, emotional and phycological turmoil. Also, one the basic principles of medical ethics state: A physician shall be dedicated to providing competent medical care, with compassion and respect for human dignity and rights. This states that a physician shall do their best to serve and respect the patients rights and self-respect. This entitles the physician to respect the patients wish to die should patient be in suffering. With this the doctors who respect the patients wish to do are not violating the most basic principles of their profession, they are but simply obeying them.Our countries medical system must be rethought. When people begin the last six months of their lives on mother earth they must have the right to choose when to ‘pull the plug’. However, the ‘pulling of the plug’ should only be allowed when one is experiencing the untreatable pain for a disease one has.I believe that physician-assisted suicide should be legal and that terminally ill people have a right to die on their own terms. Since it is their life, they should have a choice, even if they are going to die soon. Doctors who help patients die, do somewhat violate the most basic principles of their profession, but they shouldn’t be called heartless. It is not the doctors’ decision if the patient wants treatment or not. The doctor cannot make a patient live, if they do not want to. I personally think that doctors are somewhat violating the basic principles but cannot do anything about it, and they shouldn’t be punished for the patients actions and decisions. Letting them pass the way they want is respecting their patients’ autonomy and helping them avoid needless suffering. I strongly believe in this statement that it avoids needless suffering and respects their autonomy because they should have a say of how they want to spend their last days, weeks, or months. I agree with Dr. Jauhar and that we should rethink how our medical system treats people in the last six months of their lives because they know that they are going to die and no one can stop it, they should die the way they want, happy and peaceful, instead of stuck in a hospital bed attached to all these machines, trying to be cured that will most likely not be successful. Also, I think that hospitals should try to stop putting in so much money and effort into people who are incurable and should be trying to cure others, that have more of a chance. I am strongly in favor that the patients should have the choice in the way they want their life to end and that even the doctors have no control over it.Physician-assisted suicide should be legal in every state. There are a lot of painful sicknesses that people deal with today that may cause them to not enjoy their life. It should not be in the doctor’s or governments hand to decide for their life. They are not physically feeling the pain and emotion that the patient may be going through to say they can not chose to live or die. Terminally ill people should absolutely have the right to chose their fate because they are going to die either way. However, if a patient is sentenced to more than a year to live, they should not be able to make a decision till the last 6 months just as Oregon allows. States that not have made assisted suicide legal should look at Oregon’s results. Oregon has had a success when it comes to assisting people with their death. Also, their procedures of having the patient documentaly write down their wish to die and verbally stating it with 2 witnesses around may help the doctor with any issues of getting sued or blamed in the future. If assisted suicide is what the patient really wants it should be given to them because they have their own rights and freedom. That’s what America is about. Doctor’s that help people die do not violate the basic principles of being a doctor. Sure a doctor is suppose to save as many lives as they can, but their job is to also satisfy the patient and to help them with any pain they may have to be comfortable. When a patient is in need of a surgery the doctor has to ask permission in order to perform that specific task. It is the patients decision whether or not they want to proceed with the surgery or take the chances without it. Any surgery can cause death no matter how small it may be. There is no difference between asking a patient for surgery or a patient asking to end their life because both of those decisions are in their hands to decide. Dr.Jauhar writes about how the treatment of sick people in their last 6 months should be considered. As he says, aggressive treatment should be limited especially to elderly patients. People who have a short limited time to live should not live their last moments hooked on medication or any type of treatment. They should be enjoying themselves, their loved ones, and the world while they still have the chance.Imagine one being so sick that they can barely move a muscle, imagine being so sick where one can barely breathe, imagine being so sick that one wants to take their life away. Terminally ill people should have the right to end their life when they are no longer able to enjoy life. Terminally ill people believe they are never going to get better so taking their life away by a physician-assisted suicide is the best option. I believe physician-assisted suicide should be legal because it helps those who are suffering and those who are terminally ill die peacefully. Patients who are terminally ill know when they can’t live anymore so when doctors conduct a physician assisted suicide all they are doing is helping their patients die peacefully. No one wants to die suffering or live suffering, one would rather die peacefully so physician assisted suicide prevents the case of patients suffering. Doctors who help patients die do not violate their principles of their profession because they are helping their patients be heard, and be free. They are respecting their patients’ requests of not wanting to suffer anymore, if one does not want to live anymore because of pain they should be allowed to have a physician assisted suicide. “Treating” elderly’s with strong medicine that do not help them is wrong, we should definitely rethink our medical system and how we treat people in the last six months of their lives. It is much more reasonable to take a sick elderly’s life with a physician-assisted suicide because I believe they have suffered enough. If a patient is given six months to live, they should have the option to either live the six months or die peacefully. If a patient is suffering in pain, they would most likely choose the option to die peacefully and I believe that is the right choice because no one should suffer, no one should feel like they are unable to enjoy life anymore.Doctors are supposed to save lives. If a patient’s death is imminent and no medical intervention can change the fact, doctors should do what is right by the patient. Doctors should help the dying patient die on their own terms, if the previous statement is true and of course, a few other conditions. Physician-Assisted suicide should be legal in all states. If patients fall under the conditions and circumstances as those under from the Oregon Death with Dignity Act of 1997 and wants to terminate their lives, then there is no reason why they should not be helped. Doctors should try to keep patients alive, but should also do what is right by the patient. Terminally ill patients should have the right to die on their own terms, since their death can’t be stopped. It is irrational for a patient to have to go through the pain of dying and have medical charges added to their name for someone else to pay after they have passed. Doctors are not violating the basic principle of their profession by helping a patient chose death. For example, in Oregon 1,100 patients were given the prescription of death, but only 750 decided to take the prescription. It’s the patient’s choice to decide whether or not to take the prescription. The the 750 cases the doctors were respecting their patient’s anatomy and preventing them from going through unnecessary suffering. I agree with Dr. Jauhar that Physician-Assisted Suicide is an extreme position, but it is just as extreme as having a patient go through needless suffering. Occasionally, some medical systems treat the sickest and oldest patients as if they were at their life’s prime and stuff them with medication and have them undergo intense procedures that may not even work. I know this because I have witnessed this happen to person I knew. It’s best to try to help the patient as much as possible and allow the patient to say when enough is enough. After all, a patient has the right to refuse treatment, at least here in California.I think it should be available in every state cause its your choose if your given six weeks to like and they say the last weeks gonna be the worst you shouldnt have to suffer through it in complete painSign up for our free newsletter.

But at the very least, council members directed those commissioners, by a vote of 4-1, to begin those discussions.Councilman Grant Dittmar was the only member to vote no on that measure.The motion actually focuses very little on the most recent state law legalizing recreational marijuana use, which initially had been the primary context for Monday night’s discussion.Instead, council members said they would rather start by putting together a plan under the state’s previously existing medical marijuana law, and potentially “opt in” to the Michigan Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act of 2016. The plan could allow for three or four medical marijuana retailers in the city. It remains to be seen if one would be allowed in the downtown district.“I feel we should try this medical marijuana thing, take a look at how it’s going and go from there,” said mayor John Murphy.As for the recreational law, the very fact that council members are doing nothing already sets them apart from many other Northern Michigan communities. Nearly all of the communities surrounding Petoskey have explicitly opted out of recreational facilities, at least until they know what the state’s regulations will look like. According to the text of the law, unless a community expressly opts out, it will constitute as “opting in.”The state will also give first consideration for recreational licenses to businesses or individuals who already have medical marijuana licenses, which means a community will most likely need to have a medical marijuana industry in place before recreational facilities start popping up.“I think that by endorsing or approving medical marijuana we’re opening the door to recreational marijuana, which is fine,” councilwoman Suzanne Shumway said. “The people asked for that, and the people have spoken — not only the people of the state of Michigan, but the people in each ward.”Dittmar continued to raise objections to the direction council was moving. At one point in the meeting he did say he “was not necessarily averse” to the medical component, but he did have a number of questions.His primary objections, though, were over the inaction on recreational facilities, warning against a possible “legal conundrum” that could result from the ambiguity in the state’s regulatory structure. The official recommendation from city staff also advised council members to opt out until the legal landscape became clearer.While council members did not take staff up on those recommendations, they did at least direct staff to continue a dialogue about possible responses to those regulations.Despite his opposition, Dittmar played some role in getting council to this point. In the months prior to this, council members essentially held to a policy of avoidance — not opting in or out — on the new state recreational marijuana law, which passed in November.Last month, however, Dittmar urged the council to seriously consider opting out, lest the state move forward with its licensing procedure more quickly than the city could respond. That laid the groundwork for the discussion Monday night, at which all of the other council members expressed some willingness to allow marijuana provisioning retail centers.At at least one other point in the past few months, a member of the public addressed council and requested that they opt in to the medical component of Michigan’s marijuana laws, even if the council members were not ready to opt in to recreational as well.If Petoskey were to turn marijuana-friendly, it would mark a significant shift in Northern Michigan. Currently, the closest marijuana retailer to Petoskey is in Frederic Township, at the north end of Crawford County, followed by Bay City.Still, the marijuana conversation in Petoskey is just getting started. Even if the city moves forward, one issue that will likely prove ripe for argument will be whether a dispensary should be allowed in the downtown district. Mayor Murphy said he was adamantly opposed to such a possibility, but councilwoman Kate Marshall said she was torn.“If we would welcome a pharmacy downtown, why would we not welcome a medical marijuana facility downtown?” she asked.But she was clear that that question did not constitute outright support for a downtown dispensary.During public comments, Reg Smith, chair of the Downtown Management Board, nudged the city to consider non-downtown areas for the possible dispensaries, but advocated a mostly laissez-faire approach.“We have some sort of pseudo-industrial areas in the city that are pretty underutilized,” he said. “I don’t know what the future holds for those areas, but that might be something that the planning commission could take a look at.

53,Corporate Tax Rate & Jobs,Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?,2s53q3r,https://www.wyofile.com/unable-to-diversify-legislature-doubles-down-on-energy/,"Unable to diversify, Legislature doubles down on energy | WyoFile","WyoFileIndepth News about Wyoming People, Places & Policy. Wyoming news.Train tracks and houses on the edge of Kemmerer, where many work in a nearby coal mine. (Andrew Graham/WyoFile)UPDATE: This story was updated late Monday. — Ed. Lacking the political will to broaden Wyoming’s tax base and reduce dependence on the mineral industry, some worry the Legislature is placing ever-riskier bets to cling to the status quo and prop-up energy producers. The legislative session opened with a lot of talk from leading lawmakers about the need to “modernize” the state’s revenue stream. But those efforts died with a whimper. Some touted tax reforms, like an effort to broaden the sales tax to capture revenue from a diversified economy, didn’t even get a committee hearing as leadership saw they didn’t have the votes. But as new tax diversification efforts have failed, unstudied measures aimed at reviving the old means of funding state-government —  the energy industry — have advanced. Critics say they carry risks for Wyoming residents. Proposals include two tax breaks which supporters say will juice production and ultimately lead to more severance tax revenue. The Legislature also continues to advance a measure to keep aging coal plants in operation even when private sector owners want to close them, and a bill directing a legislative committee to consider suing states that have blocked coal port development. “We’re just hunkering down,” said House Minority Floor Leader Cathy Connolly. “And when you’re hunkering down, you’re not thinking about anything other than maintenance of the status quo.”Opponents of these measures call them risky bets. In the case of the tax breaks, opponents say suggestions of production increases are oversold and the state will lose out on revenue.In the case of the coal plant bill, a University of Wyoming economist and other critics say the Legislature is putting the state’s everyday citizens at risk of paying higher power bills to subsidize waning coal jobs. But energy industry lobbyists know their industry continues to keep the state afloat even when energy markets are hurting.When Petroleum Association of Wyoming director Pete Obermueller asked the House Revenue Committee to pass a severance tax break for producers, he pointed to the state’s failure to diversify its tax structure. In 2016, the state suffered when the price of oil dropped. Production and revenues plunged together, Obermueller reminded the committee. “Those of you who were here obviously know that,” he said, “because obviously we [the energy industry] pay most of the bills around here.” Last summer, a new state report revealed that  an influx of workers and businesses in other industries wouldn’t generate enough tax revenue to pay for the state services they receive. Without accompanying tax code changes, economic diversification comes at a loss for the state, the study concluded. Obermueller seized on the study’s conclusions to remind lawmakers that as things now stand only economic growth in the energy sector carries a positive fiscal impact for the state. Unlike blockchain businesses or data storage centers, a tax break designed to spur oil and natural gas production will generate more revenue than it costs, he said.“We’re talking about economic development for an industry that actually does economic development,” Obermueller said. The state’s financial risks are growing as the Legislature struggles to broaden the tax base, leaving it ever-more vulnerable to downturns in the fossil-fuel industry.Though still flush with deep savings accounts, the Legislature is spending those down without viable alternatives to replace them, according to the Legislative Service Office’s chief fiscal analyst.“We are burning through cash,” LSO Budget and Fiscal Division Administrator Don Richards told minority party lawmakers on Wednesday, when he addressed the Democratic Caucus during its weekly meeting. Though lawmakers will still put millions into savings this year, that amount is slowing, Richards said. “As a state we are spending our savings and we are not saving as much,” he said. Lawmakers appear more dedicated to fighting for the coal industry than finding replacement revenue streams as it continues to decline. On Wednesday, a Senate committee declined to take a vote on a corporate income tax projected to raise $45 million a year for schools. On Thursday, the House advanced a bill to keep aging coal plants in operation. The Senate advanced a bill to set aside funds for a lawsuit against West Coast states that won’t allow coal ports.“Enough is enough from our neighbors on the West Coast,” said Sen. Tara Nethercott (R-Cheyenne) as she spoke in favor of the lawsuit bill. “It’s time for us to be able to educate our children.”But another Cheyenne senator argued that coal companies weren’t asking the state to file such a lawsuit and were engaged in their own. The Senate was making noise on behalf of coal for show, Sen. Affie Ellis (R) suggested.“I think we’re trying to score some political points and act like we’re doing something,” Ellis said.The bill would also return the state to a poor practice of hiring outside attorneys instead of using the Wyoming Attorney General’s office, Ellis said. House Bill 251 – Coal export terminal litigation, sponsored by Rep. Chuck Gray (R-Casper), would set aside $250,000 for legal action.  Another coal bill carries a much larger fiduciary risk. Senate File 159 – New opportunities for Wyoming coal fired generation seeks to protect aging coal plants from closure by forcing utility companies to look for a new buyer before shuttering money-losing operations. Then, Wyoming utility companies would have to buy power from the new owner. The bill was brought by lawmakers in southwest Wyoming concerned about Pacificorp’s efforts to shutter one of the generators at the Naughton Plant outside Kemmerer.Chief sponsor Sen. Dan Dockstader (R-Afton) called it a “big picture bill” to find new opportunities for the state’s coal burning plants, and thus the mines that feed them. “There’s got to be a solution out there” to save Wyoming’s coal plants and the jobs they provide, Dockstader told WyoFile. “We’re going to find it.” Lawmakers from that region in particular are desperate to protect jobs and the property and ad valorem tax revenues in their region. “I don’t know if we’re going to stop all this” coal industry decline, said Kemmerer Rep. Tom Crank (R), “but maybe we can change direction.”  But opponents say the bill is industry protectionism subsidized by Wyoming residents who will pay more for electricity. They worry it will lower regulatory safeguards when the plants pass into the hands of speculative business ventures. Companies interested in capturing carbon to pump it into oil wells and even cryptocurrency miners have been bandied about as possible power plant buyers. Mostly, the bill puts lawmakers’ efforts to protect the coal mines and power “uneconomic coal plants’’ on the backs and power bills of citizens, UW economist Jay Shogren wrote in a recent op-ed.  Rocky Mountain Power has estimated it will cost between $146 million and $239 million over the next decade to keep the Naughton Plant running, according to the utility. Today, that cost is spread among all the customers of PacifiCorp’s multi-state grid.Under Dockstader’s bill, “100 percent” of the costs “would be passed on to Wyoming families and businesses through higher bills — a hidden tax,” Shogren wrote. The bill “will commit Wyoming families and businesses to spend hundreds of millions in higher energy prices to prop up uneconomical coal plants,” Shogren wrote.  “Perhaps Wyoming citizens will be glad to pay higher energy bills if it means coal jobs for their friends and neighbors — perhaps not. But they should have the choice and they should know the true costs of bills that take on the market.”On the House floor, Rep. Landen Brown (R-Cheyenne) reminded his colleagues they often talk about diversifying the state’s economy. Saying he had campaigned on ending Wyoming’s “boom and bust,” he argued that the bill will take the state in the opposite direction. “What I see here is just a continuation of that effort to stay riding on the rails of coal, oil and natural gas,” he said.The House passed the bill on a voice vote with what appeared to be a large majority voting in favor. It must pass two more floor votes this week. The legislative session started with at least 10 bills to increase or broaden existing taxes or create new ones. It also started with the leaders of both chambers endorsing proposals to broaden the sales tax and even a nod toward debating a property tax increase. The temporary Capitol building has been an abattoir for those ideas ever since. The Senate even killed a statewide lodging tax that seemed destined for passage on Monday. House Bill 66 – Lodging tax would have raised an estimated $19 million a year in state revenue directed to the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Additional revenues would have been distributed to the counties in which they were generated. The tax appeared an easy sell for lawmakers: It was endorsed by many in the industry it proposed to tax because the money would have paid to promote tourism. But the Senate voted 19-7 on third reading to dispatch the bill. Three senators declared a conflict and did not vote on the bill. Broader tax reform efforts to wean the state of its energy industry dependency failed or didn’t get a vote. Speaker of the House Steve Harshman (R-Casper) maneuvered to pass a bill to broaden the sales tax while also lowering it. He ultimately dropped the idea when it became clear he couldn’t get the votes needed.This week, the Senate Corporations Committee put the seeming final blow to any major tax reform effort when it killed House Bill 220 – National retail fairness act. The bill was a carefully crafted income tax to hit large out-of-state corporations in the retail and hospitality sectors, like Walmart or Applebee’s. It would raise millions for schools without affecting everyday Wyoming residents, proponents said. Backed by nearly every leading lawmaker of both political parties, the bill sailed through the House on a 44-16 vote. The Department of Revenue had a hard time estimating the impact, but called its estimate of $45 million a year conservative. The tax hit headwinds in the Senate as corporate lobbyists and Wyoming Republican Party loyalists raised a fierce outcry. Republican activists labeled it the first step in an effort to write broader income taxes. Lobbyists said it would hurt corporate bottom lines and lead them to cut Wyoming jobs — a threat some proponents scoffed at given the scale and national pricing systems of the corporations in question.But no matter the weight of the names on the bill and the amount of money the bill could have put into education coffers, it wasn’t enough to overcome anti-tax sentiment in the Senate. Before Senate Corporations Committee Chairman Bill Landen (R-Casper) tabled the tax bill without a vote, he said it did not have enough support on the Senate floor. The refusal to vote has infuriated Harshman and other House leaders because their chamber put votes for a tax increase on the record and the Senate balked, according to representatives who talked to WyoFile this week. The newly appointed chairman of the Senate Revenue Committee Sen. Cale Case (R-Lander), normally an anti-tax libertarian, said Wyoming needed to take its destiny into its own hands with the tax.“Wyoming has often become a colony for all respects and that troubles me greatly,” Case said. Case compared the tax to the one significant tax Wyoming does collect.“Fifty years ago we passed an income tax,” Case said. “We called it a severance tax on corporations extracting minerals from Wyoming.”Landen’s committee heard substantial testimony on Feb. 14, but delayed voting until Feb. 19. By then, Landen told WyoFile later, he and other Senate leaders had counted votes. His committee had the votes to move it to the chamber floor, but it faced certain death there, he said. Some corporate lobbyists expressed a preference for a broader corporate income tax, calling it more fair than one designed to hit only certain companies. But a broader income tax would be sure to fail in the Wyoming Legislature, Landen told WyoFile. “You start hitting your Main Street brick-and-mortar [businesses],” Landen said. “That’s the thing we are trying to avoid.”If there is no appetite for a highly targeted tax to hit mega-corporations, Landen does not know what kind of tax will be palatable, he said. Despite his decision to keep his committee members from recording a vote on HB220, he called for courage. “There are those in the [Republican] Party who will hit anybody and everybody” for any bill that even looks like a tax increase, Landen said. “Sometimes it takes courage to make a vote that you know some aren’t going to like.”Tax breaks to juice the flagging energy industry are faring better.The Legislature passed one tax break for the energy industry and is close to passing another. At this point, lawmakers don’t know what impact either will have on the state’s balance sheet but they’re hopeful it could juice energy production, and thus severance tax revenues. The Legislature passed House Bill 120 – Energy production inventory Monday. It creates an exemption on ad valorem property taxes for the storage of energy production equipment before its installation. The exemption applies to anything from drilling equipment to massive wind turbines, provided they’re still in storage and waiting to be used. The equipment would have to be stored for at least a year to receive the exemption.The Legislature’s fiscal analysts did not calculate how much tax revenue Wyoming might lose to the exemption. The amount of stored equipment that could qualify will depend on Wyoming energy markets, said Department of Revenue Director Dan Noble. One big question will be how the wind industry reacts to it. With large wind farms on tap to be built in the state, and with energy equipment storage yards better established elsewhere, it’s unlikely turbines will be kept in storage for long, Noble said. But if companies choose to use the state to establish storage yards then Wyoming will start to lose out. “Wind turbines are extremely expensive,” Noble said. “If they were going to be laid down and maintained in place it would be a somewhat costly exemption.”  A severance tax break for oil and gas companies also continues to advance. Brought by leading senators, the bill started out as a prospect that frightened many fiscal hawks — it would have exempted new oil and gas wells from paying full severance taxes for the first two years of production. The original bill would have cost the state over $100 million in tax revenue by 2022, and far more if oil prices improved but stayed below $80 a barrel, when the tax exemption would be lifted. It was later amended to apply only to idle oil and gas wells brought back into production.Last week, Harshman successfully convinced the House Revenue Committee to amend the bill, Senate File 134 – Severance tax-exemption to reduce the tax exemption and the number of idle wells eligible for the tax break. His amendment applies the exemption to wells shut in for 12 months, rather than the six months required by the Senate.The Senate proposal offered a 66 percent cut in the severance tax rate. The House version of the exemption gives companies a 33 percent cut in severance taxes as long as prices remain below a certain point.The Senate will have a chance to influence the bill again in conference committee if the House passes it.If the rolling average of those prices stays below those points for six months, companies would only have to pay a four percent severance tax on oil and gas produced from the re-activated wells. The standard severance tax on oil and gas is six percent. The fiscal impact isn’t known, but proponents of the bill like Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman and oil businessman Eli Bebout (R-Riverton) have argued that today the state is not collecting severance taxes on such wells because there is little incentive for companies to re-develop them.‘Nothing of nothing is nothing,’ the proponents suggest.On the Senate floor, Bebout declared he did not have a conflict of interest on the bill because he belongs to “a class of people” — energy industry workers — who would be affected by the Legislation. The “class” terminology allows lawmakers in Wyoming’s citizen Legislature to vote on bills that might affect their livelihood. There are thousands of wells in Wyoming that have been idle for at least a year, according to data provided by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. But it’s unclear whether companies are reworking them on their own, which could obviate the need for the incentive. A spokeswoman for the WOGCC said her group couldn’t easily answer the question.Over six months in 2018, between 2-7 percent of 10,000 idle wells were reactivated, spokeswoman Kimberly Mazza said on Monday. The 10,000 well figure includes wells on private, state and federal lands, Mazza said. Bebout said he didn’t know how many wells would be affected. “The wells are shut in and the recompletions are not being done,” he said. Bebout did not believe many were being done in the state, he said. “Probably not very many” in the last year or two, he said.  But Wyoming isn’t competitive with other states, he said. “People are going to take their money and go somewhere else. People say ‘ah, no they won’t’… they will,” Bebout said.Oil companies drilling in Wyoming take home 51.6 percent of revenues after state and federal taxes, according to a study commissioned by the Legislature last year. That split is lower than oil companies in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah but on par or higher than companies’ take from Montana, Colorado and North Dakota. With no official estimate of the impact of the exemption, lawmakers are essentially flying blind on the tax break and hoping it will work, opponents argued during debate on the measure. “We don’t know who, where and how this will impact us,” said Bebout’s counterpart, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Nicholas (R-Cheyenne). “We don’t know the number of wells that will be impacted.”Lawmakers with other interests argued they wouldn’t catch a similar break. “When our cattle prices go down, we don’t necessarily get an exemption,” said Rep. Jamie Flitner (R-Greybull), a rancher.

Linda Anderson says The hidden agenda is circular. We need to diversify to provide better paying and steadier jobs. The government lives off of extraction industries. Diversification only helps people, not government. We are afraid of any new taxes unless they cripple the wind industry. Consequently we are stuck living off of extraction industries and people should forget about better jobs through diversification.

Wyoming news.Train tracks and houses on the edge of Kemmerer, where many work in a nearby coal mine. (Andrew Graham/WyoFile)UPDATE: This story was updated late Monday. — Ed. Lacking the political will to broaden Wyoming’s tax base and reduce dependence on the mineral industry, some worry the Legislature is placing ever-riskier bets to cling to the status quo and prop-up energy producers. The legislative session opened with a lot of talk from leading lawmakers about the need to “modernize” the state’s revenue stream. But those efforts died with a whimper. Some touted tax reforms, like an effort to broaden the sales tax to capture revenue from a diversified economy, didn’t even get a committee hearing as leadership saw they didn’t have the votes. But as new tax diversification efforts have failed, unstudied measures aimed at reviving the old means of funding state-government —  the energy industry — have advanced.

People say ‘ah, no they won’t’… they will,” Bebout said.Oil companies drilling in Wyoming take home 51.6 percent of revenues after state and federal taxes, according to a study commissioned by the Legislature last year. That split is lower than oil companies in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah but on par or higher than companies’ take from Montana, Colorado and North Dakota. With no official estimate of the impact of the exemption, lawmakers are essentially flying blind on the tax break and hoping it will work, opponents argued during debate on the measure. “We don’t know who, where and how this will impact us,” said Bebout’s counterpart, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Nicholas (R-Cheyenne). “We don’t know the number of wells that will be impacted.”Lawmakers with other interests argued they wouldn’t catch a similar break. “When our cattle prices go down, we don’t necessarily get an exemption,” said Rep. Jamie Flitner (R-Greybull), a rancher.

It helps coal miners by providing new job opportunities. The only group it does not help is the owners of fossil fuel production businesses, who are wealthy enough to buy the government and keep themselves on top until everything crashes. Linda Anderson says The hidden agenda is circular. We need to diversify to provide better paying and steadier jobs. The government lives off of extraction industries. Diversification only helps people, not government. We are afraid of any new taxes unless they cripple the wind industry. Consequently we are stuck living off of extraction industries and people should forget about better jobs through diversification.

Scharfenberger of Albany who lamented the “celebration of abortion” as it is “a dehumanization of a whole class of human beings in our society.”Advancing the view that fetuses are human beings, deserving of legal protection, Scharfenberger articulated the Catholic view that life begins at conception. An on-screen banner proclaimed, “FATIH LEADERS BLAST NY ABORTION LAW” when, in reality, many Jewish and Protestant faith leaders fully support it.The bishop might have told a lie when he claimed that the law “goes way beyond” Roe v. Wade as Roe, just like the New York law, allows for late-term abortion when the life and health of the mother is at risk.Video of Cuomo, talking about his Catholic faith during his State of the State address was shown. Obviously knowing the answer (Catholics can’t support abortion), Fox Friend Katie Pavlich asked how Cuomo's comments “square with this new pro-abortion bill that he celebrated.”Scharfenberger described Cuomo’s comments as “radical” in that they distance Cuomo from “the sanctity of human life.”After co-host Pete Hegseth talked about how awful it was that the law “celebrates” abortion, Scharffenberger suggested that the new law was tantamount to torture. He cited the anti-choice propaganda movie, the Silent Scream,” produced by anti-choice zealot Dr. Bernard Nathanson, claiming that they “recognize the humanity of the unborn.”On cue, Piro reported that there are lots of Catholics who are “screaming for Governor Cuomo to be excommunicated."" Scharffenberger said he understood the “outrage and anger,” but that because Cuomo doesn’t live in his diocese, he doesn’t have jurisdiction over him. The bishop noted that eventually Cuomo could be denied communion and excommunicated and hoped that Cuomo would recognize the error of his ways.Don’t know if cohost Katie Pavlich is Catholic, but, after Scharffenberger’s explanation of excommunication, Pavlich, who believes late-term abortions are ""recreational,"" validated what might be the Fox message – that Cuomo is so bad that he should be kicked out of the Catholic Church – “Late term abortion and the celebration of it seems like, pretty close to the standard for that cause,” she said.The “celebration” was over the expansion of women’s reproductive rights. (Too bad Fox doesn’t care about that).

Seymour, a 40-year resident of ArlingtonMy wife — a former public school teacher — helps out regularly in our grandson’s first grade classroom at Abingdon Elementary School in south Arlington.  Although she has been volunteering for years, she experienced last month — for the first time — an Arlington Public Schools lock-down and “active shooter” drill.  Since 2016, Virginia law has required a minimum of four such drills annually at all Virginia public schools.The drill was conducted calmly and efficiently, she was pleased to note.  When the drill was announced, children and volunteers quieted and walked quickly into the classroom closet, away from windows and doors.  Lights were turned off, exterior doors were locked, and curtains and blinds were lowered to block an intruder’s vision.  The closet was crowded, stuffy and dark but, except for one child whispering “I think I need to go to the bathroom,” it was mercifully free of drama.She wondered, however, how this new rite of school passage came to be and whether adults were, in fact, violating the trust of the children with whom they were closeted.  Is this the best we can do to address the recent spate of school shootings?  And, she thought, what are the potential psychological effects of school lockdown drills on young children?  Although no studies have been conducted to date, it appears to some observers that lockdown drills are far more effective in protecting the school’s “institutional concern for reputational risk-management” and potential civil liability than the children themselves.Last year, Virginians had held out some hope that their legislators might address school shootings in a meaningful way when the House of Delegates convened its “Select Committee on School Safety” to review the Commonwealth’s school safety policies and practices. That hope was quickly extinguished when Chairman (and Speaker of the House) Kirk Cox (R) announced that gun control and gun violence were outside the Committee’s scope.The Committee’s report, released in late 2018, was as anodyne and toothless as most expected it to be.  Its recommendations ranged from the obvious (“student mental health is a growing and multi-faceted issue”), to the purposely obscure and jargon-filled (“localities should establish consensus-driven stakeholder processes” for school planning), to those reflecting a kind of tired resignation (schools should explore the purchasing of “ballistic barriers,” such as bullet proof white boards and backpacks).  Each recommendation, however, had a common characteristic — it wholly ignored the role of gun proliferation in enabling school shootings. It was as if Richmond established a “Select Committee” to consider teen pregnancy and then directed it to examine only the strength and durability of condoms.Although Arlington’s representatives to the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates have proposed, as in past years, a package of common sense and popular gun control measures, none have survived Committee review (an outcome in which the National Rifle Association has publicly exulted).  Republicans chairing powerful committees have refused to consider “red flag bills” intended to temporarily separate persons from their firearms when a court finds that they pose a substantial danger to themselves or others; universal background checks prior to all gun sales; reinstatement of Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month law; prohibiting persons subject to protective orders from possessing firearms; banning assault-type rifles; imposing home security requirements to prevent children from accessing firearms; and requiring gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, among many others.With the session scheduled to end in early March and nearly all of the Democrats’ gun control measures already dead, what can be expected from Richmond?“Open Carry” Me Back to Jesus:  Republican majorities have consistently rejected Democratic proposals to bar guns from public libraries (H.B. 1856) (2019), allow localities to restrict firearms at meetings of local governments (S.B. 1303 (2019)), or even strengthen firearm storage requirements for licensed day care providers (H.B. 2372 (2019)).  Indeed, Republican Senator Dick Black recently introduced legislation to repeal a 140-year old state law prohibiting the carrying of guns and other dangerous weapons into a place of worship during a service (S.B. 1024 (2019)).  Several weeks ago, the Senate narrowly passed the bill on a party-line vote.The bill epitomizes the NRA’s deeply cynical approach to mass shootings.  In the wake of the African Methodist church shooting by a white supremacist in South Carolina in 2015, Charles Cotton, an NRA Board member, blamed the pastor killed in the South Carolina shooting for the deaths of his eight congregates.  Cotton asserted that the churchgoers might still be alive if the pastor (who also served as a state senator) had supported a law allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons without permits.The NRA has not taken any position on other white supremacist firearms-filled events, such as the Charlottesville “United the Right” Rally, except to forcefully oppose all efforts by the Democrats to prohibit guns within public spaces during municipal permitted events, (H.B.  1956) (2019), and oppose efforts to add Charlottesville to the group of Virginia towns and cites that are allowed to prohibit assault weapons in public spaces. (S.B. 1482) (2019).  Even white supremacists, the NRA maintains, should have ample public space in which to exercise their Second Amendment rights — including places of worship.Pistol-Packin School Marms:  Republicans have not yet been successful in amending current law to allow the arming of school teachers.  During prior sessions, the General Assembly declined to enact such legislation.  Governor McAuliffe expressed concern about arming teachers and threatened vetoes, and both the Virginia Education Association and the Virginia Parent Teachers Association expressed their strong opposition to the practice.  Attorney General Mark Herring, in 2018, also issued an opinion concluding that one rural Virginia County — Lee County Public Schools — lacked the statutory authority to arm teachers and other school personnel.Nevertheless, Lee County has filed a lawsuit in Virginia Circuit Court asking for judicial relief and a declaration that certain school employees may be deemed “conservators of the peace” and carry guns on school property.  The prior Virginia Attorney General and Republican Gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli is representing Lee County in the lawsuit.  Depending on the outcome of the suit, Virginia schools’ quarterly lock-down drills may soon be overseen by gun-toting teachers and school aides.Priming the Iron Pipeline:  Until it was repealed in 2012, Virginia’s “one-gun-a-month” law prohibited the purchase of more than one handgun per person during any 30-day period.  Virginia adopted the law when legislators could no longer ignore compelling evidence that Virginia was the primary source of guns trafficked to other jurisdictions — along the “Iron Pipeline” of Interstate 95 — and used to commit crimes throughout the northeastern United States.  To many, it also seemed that a diet of a dozen guns a year should satisfy even the most ardent law-abiding gun owner.The Gifford Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has reported that, in the years following the law’s passage, the likelihood that a Virginia dealer was the source of guns recovered in northeastern cities declined by more than two-thirds in states throughout the Northeast.  More recently, press reports by the Washington Post and others have documented the continued importance of widespread interstate trafficking of Virginia firearms in violent crimes conducted elsewhere.As in past years, Democrats have introduced proposals to restore Virginia’s former statutory prohibition on the sale of more than one gun per month.  (S.B. 1446 (2019), (H.B. 2604 (2019).  Though broadly supported by both citizens and policing organizations, Republican legislators have refused to allow the proposal to go to a full vote.  Absent reinstatement of the law, it appears certain that gun traffickers will continue to purchase guns in “gun rights” states like Virginia for re-sale to and re-use by criminals in Northeastern states that have enacted much tougher gun laws.Beyond “Thoughts and Prayers.”  Given staunch Republican opposition to even the most modest gun control measures, is there any hope for sensible gun control in the near term?  Surprisingly, there are a couple of promising signs.  Most important, Republican control of both the House of Delegates and Senate hangs by a thread. The Virginia GOP currently holds a narrow two-vote majority in both the State Senate and House of Delegates and Virginia Democrats have real prospects to control one or both houses in Richmond following the 2019 elections.  All 120 seats in the General Assembly and all 40 Senate seats are up for election.  Moderate suburban voters who support gun control tend to vote Democrat and have been voting in greater numbers.  In addition, federal judges recently selected a House of Delegates redistricting map that heavily favors Democrats and could markedly increase the likelihood that Democrats will control the House following the fall elections.In addition, recent case law suggests that urban counties and municipalities such as Arlington and McLean — which find anathema the absolutist view of gun rights espoused in more rural parts of the state— may have a new tool with which to regulate guns within their jurisdictions.  In Teixeira v. County of Alameda, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (ruling en banc) recently held that a County could require a prospective gun store owner to obtain a conditional use permit and comply with the County’s zoning ordinances.  Those ordinances required, among other things, that businesses selling firearms be located at least 500 feet from any school, day care center, liquor store, and residentially zoned districts.  In May of last year, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the applicant’s appeal of the Circuit Court’s decision.Citizens in Arlington and other suburban jurisdictions have, in recent years, expressed outrage that their local officials cannot use common local zoning and land use powers to limit access to guns.  The proposed siting of gun shops in residential neighborhoods near a school in McLean and across from a day care center in the Lyon Park neighborhood in Arlington resulted in extraordinary public concern and opposition.  The Teixeira and other local land use cases suggest that localities can, consistent with the Second Amendment, employ their zoning powers to restrict local gun sale and distribution to promote public health.In Virginia, however, localities still must contend with Virginia’s broad preemption statute which bars nearly all local government powers that seek to regulate firearms.  Northern Virginia legislators have annually pursued legislation to modify the Virginia preemption statute and recover local land use and zoning powers over firearms.  This year — as in past years — their efforts were defeated by legislators from hard-line gun rights districts.  (H.B. 1992) (2019).  That may all soon change, however.

14,Tablets vs. Textbooks,Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?,2s14q9r,https://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2012/05/25/ipads-in-the-science-classroom-the-bad-the-ugly-and-the-good,"iPads in the Science Classroom: The Bad, The Ugly, and The Good | ScienceBlogs","I know of a couple of cases where high schools are switching to the use of iPads or other tablets, replacing existing computer infrastructure with the handy and very cool computing device. When it comes to technology, I've never been particularly impressed with school administrations, and K-12 technology departments tend to be a little under-resourced as well, so it does not surprise me that this decision is being made. It is, of course, the wrong thing to do. I'm not talking about using iPads, I'm taking about canceling funding for future hardware cycles of laptops and desktops so the existing machines will only be available for a year or so, and using that budget item to buy and deploy iPads instead. Or, as may be the case here and there, transitioning from traditional cpu's to iPads over a short time frame with the assumption that all existing technological needs being met will be met with the new hardware with little difficulty. From a teacher's point of view, this is roughly like taking your Subaru Outback into the garage and saying ""Could you change the oil and put on new wipers please? Oh, and while you're doing that, make it into a Honda Accord, as well?"" (Only the teacher is the mechanic.) iPads and Android tablets may eventually replace laptops, but at the moment, there are no configurations of personal device and hardware that will do more than a few things needed in a modern science classroom, and the system is not set up to institute the needed wholesale rebuilding of IT infrastructure in the classroom's learning plan. In fact, the gap between what can be done and what should be done in this case is so large that it could be argued that a rapid transition from laptops and desktops to iPads or Androids is unethical. I would even go so far as to question the motivations of anyone pushing this sort of decision. Let's look at the problem in more detail. Don't worry Apple lovers: I promise to conclude at the end that iPads are needed in every classroom. But doing it wrong is not an acceptable option. The BadiPads are great. They can be used in the classroom setting to great effect. But they can not be used today in science classrooms to replace laptops or other traditional computers for several reasons. First, there is equipment in many science classes that can not at present be hooked up to iPads, and that require laptops, such as the full range of installed Lab Pro technology.1 Second, many of the computer based activities used currently in science classes are web-based applications that use Flash. You can't use Flash on an iPad. Third, much of the use of computers involves simple document management and collaboration. iPads are very bad at this at the moment. Fourth, although there are some great apps currently available for use on an iPad, only a very small number of the current classroom computer uses are replaced with these apps. A science teacher who covers two or three classes may have between 20 and 40 specific computer based applications not counting basic text document and spreadsheet work across the entire year's curriculum (including Lab Pro activities, web based activities, and installed software). At the moment, three or four of those could be replaced with existing iPad apps, and a few will never be replaced. On the other hand, eventually, other wonderful and amazing apps that take advantage of the iPad or Android Tablet technology will come on the scene. But the process is a slow one. Seriously; Tomorrow there will be students in the classroom; they are not going to go away and let us get this new technology ready for them. A whole bunch of new ones will be showing up in September. A wholesale change would require taking a year or two off, but that is not an option. An iPad/tablet revolution is insane. An iPad/tablet evolution is inevitable and should be really cool. There are other issues as well, some of which may be more specific to a certain implementation or that may be easily enough dealt with that they can be ignored. (Am I missing any other large issues?) There are also issues that are more about funding and program implementation than technology. For instance, the replacement cycle for hardware in K-12 public schools is long, while the obsoletion cycle for Apple hardware generally is short (or at least shortish). Will some school systems find themselves with iPads bought just before the next model is out, four years later, unable to run the OS or key applications? Probably not often, but quite possibly now and then.The Ugly I am under the impression that teachers are being asked in some cases to pick up the slack. In cases where iPads are meant to replace laptops rapidly, teachers would have to implement iPad based solutions to each of their current IT based activities. This brings us to something that a lot of people don't understand about teachers, and by ""a lot of people"" I include school administrators and IT experts. Consider the modal science teacher already mentioned, who, conservatively, has 25 uses of computers over two or three courses in a given school year. For each use, an iPad application has to be implemented. Assume the applications all exist now. Very conservatively estimated, a total change in the tool requires three hours of reworking of lesson plans. So, this teacher is required to spend about 75 hours making this change, at minimum. When does the teacher do this? Where in the school year is this time carved out? Where in the day? I know two teachers that recently took on an AP class. The AP program required by the College Board had changed and the class they took over followed the old guidelines. These teachers are required to change the course to meet the new guidelines. When do that do it? As it turns out, they do it at about 8:00 PM through midnight a couple/few nights a week. These teachers leave their houses before 6:00 AM, teach through mid afternoon, meet in the afternoon to do other teacher stuff, go home, then they grade and work on their lesson plan for the next day perhaps taking an hour and a half off to eat and spend some time with their families, then at about 8:00 PM they get on the phone with each other to work out changes in the curriculum required to fit the new standards. Oh, sure, the school gave them time last summer to ""remake"" the course to the new standards. Two days each, I think it was. In fact, these teachers are taking a pay cut. Normally there are things teachers can do for extra pay, a few hours a semester. Teachers usually do these things. But when a course has to be overhauled and the teacher is doing it on private time, there is no way to take on this extra work. So, the teacher gets to work until 1:00 AM instead of 8:00 or 9:00 PM for less, rather than more, pay. Teachers are never, or almost never, compensated for the work they do to compensate for everyone else's great plans for how to improve or change the system of education. In the case of replacing desktops and laptops with iPads, the situation is particularly egregious. Here, the employees in the IT department are getting LESS work to do, while the teachers are getting MORE work to do.If I was a teacher in a school about to implement a wholesale changeover to iPads or tablets, I'd be talking to my Union. The above scenario assumes that there are apps and hardware interfaces in place. But as discussed before, there are not. What happens when one September the teachers show up and the school district has tossed the old laptops rather than maintaining them, and all the shiny new students have shiny new iPads, and the instructions to the teachers amounts to: ""Make this work""? One thing that will happen is that teachers will not be able to do a lot of things previously done on laptops with the iPads, so instead, they will use notebooks. No, not that kind of notebook...THIS kind of notebook:A notebook. Together with an iPad, you can do anything, almost! Which is fine, but not if the intention of full iPad deployment was to move towards a paperless system!The wholesale and rapid implementation of iPads or any similar hardware to the exclusion of laptops and desktops would be very ugly indeed. Where school districts are thinking of doing this, they should think again. Keep the desktop and laptop systems in place, maintain them, even plan on going through with the next replacement cycle. Unfortunately, that is not likely to happen in many school districts. Administrators will go ""Oh, shiny!"" and authorize the complete shift of funds from traditional computers to iPads and order the teachers to make it work. The IT people will gain considerably because they will have less work to do (and there may be other benefits to them as well) and the teachers will be tasked with the impossible and blamed when things don't work. Ugly.The Good Having said all that, iPads and other similar devices are great and they should be deployed and used. However, for now, it has to be done one use at a time and one app at a time. Until teachers have a choice of several options for most of the in-class uses, instead of zero options for almost all potential uses, iPads can be used selectively. Apps that do things teachers want to do will emerge.Make no mistake about it: The commercial software industry largely ignores educational uses, as does the OpenSource community frankly, at higher grade levels. There are dozens of ways to download a video or rename a batch of files or read your emails but there are only one or two applications that demonstrate population genetics and one or two that demonstrate genotype-phenotype relationships suitable for high school. All those web-based Flash apps to study genetics or ecology or geology are produced by the educational community itself and various volunteers often at Universities, sometimes under grants, sometimes not. Small specialized companies have come and gone. I've never seen anyone effectively use a specialized learning application produced by Microsoft or Sun or Apple or Hewlett Packard in the High School science classroom. So, we really don't know if this will work. Still, I remain optimistic that in the particular development environments of Android and iPad and similar systems, the software can emerge and be useful. In fact, it can be competitive and diverse. Probably. I have to add something to make this all very clear. If you look at the apps that are out there, there may seem to be more neat apps for science education than I'm letting on. However, science teachers don't get to design their courses around a list of cool apps that happen to be available. They are required to develop courses that meet standards that were written by people without iPads. The truth is, many of the cool looking apps are not as usable as one might think. And, really, there are not that many. This is not a failing of app developers or of teachers. It is simply a function of the newness of the technology. There is a second major use for iPads or Androids which, I predict, will make them very useful between now and the time when more than a few useful educational apps are available, and also, might pay the bills for iPad implementation while still maintaining traditional computers for the time being. I refer here to eBooks. We can discuss eBooks in schools and how they can be implemented another time. For now, suffice it to say that eBooks can be cheaper than paper books, especially if the market develops to provide them as chapters for mix and match curriculum development or as custom products more flexible than currently done in print, rather than as whole packages. Textbooks represent a sizable chunk of money in a K-12 budget, especially in High School. Textbooks on iPads or Androids could be cheaper, more adaptable, and better for all the technological bells and whistles that could be implemented, making them a superior choice at a much tighter time scale than other learning apps. In one estimate, that I made up in my head earlier today so this is a very rough guess, a complete changeover to eBooks could save about $100 per year per student. Leasing an iPad costs about $100 per year per student. So there you go. (Having said that, no, the teachers can't write the damn text books in their own time so don't even think that!)Finally, a quick word on cost. Cost is less of a factor than one might think in this sort of decision. Aside from saving that may or may not occur related to the use of eBooks, consider the simple fact that an iPad costs less than a student's text books. A text may cost anywhere from 50 to over 100 dollars. Textbooks are used for a few years, and a student takes a few classes that use textbooks a year. So, over the course of a 4 year high school career, the equivalent of about 5 new textbooks must be purchased across various subjects, and that probably costs over $400. An iPad should last a few years. A new, fairly advanced Apple iPad MD328LL/A with 16GB storage and Wi-Fi costs just over 500 retail, would be less in bulk at educational discounts, and can be leased for about $100 a year ($400 per student per high school career). Other tablets are much cheaper and might be just as useful or even more useful, depending on the software that ends up being available. For instance, a 7 inch Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with Wi-Fi costs about $250. That device may be better than an iPad because it is designed to work with a stylus. A typical notebook computer, which would give students access to those flash based tools on the web, allow them to manage documents via Google Docs and to use a word processor in a normal way (meaning, with a keyboard) and that would probably hook up to all Lab Pro interface equipment, costs about $290. Not as cool, but possibly more effective. The differences among these devices in terms of what they can and can not do well and the cost differences do not form a straightforward relationship at all, and in all cases, the decision as to what to invest in is always short term as far as the hardware goes. IT departments can adapt to any of these solutions. The hard part, and the important part, is figuring out what needs to happen in the classroom. That would involve asking the teachers and getting them involved in the process.Which, as far as I can tell, usually does not happen nearly as often as it should. For no good reason. ____________________1As I write this, I learn that Vernier has released iPad software for LabQuest 2 technology! That's excellent. Most installed Lab Pro devices are probably not LabQuest 2, and the iPad software does minimal work with the data, but it does export it for use with the much more developed Logger Pro software which runs on a laptop or desktop computer. So there is movement in that direction, which is nice. At the moment, if you are going to continue to use Lab Pro technology and you want to use iPads, you will need to keep the laptops around, probably upgrade your sensor hardware, and change the curriculum a bit to match the wireless interface. The nice thing about the wireless interface is that all the students with their iPads can observe data on any given properly set up experiment in the room. Feature image by Extra Ketchup.

When it comes to technology, I've never been particularly impressed with school administrations, and K-12 technology departments tend to be a little under-resourced as well, so it does not surprise me that this decision is being made. It is, of course, the wrong thing to do. I'm not talking about using iPads, I'm taking about canceling funding for future hardware cycles of laptops and desktops so the existing machines will only be available for a year or so, and using that budget item to buy and deploy iPads instead. Or, as may be the case here and there, transitioning from traditional cpu's to iPads over a short time frame with the assumption that all existing technological needs being met will be met with the new hardware with little difficulty. From a teacher's point of view, this is roughly like taking your Subaru Outback into the garage and saying ""Could you change the oil and put on new wipers please? Oh, and while you're doing that, make it into a Honda Accord, as well?"" (Only the teacher is the mechanic.) iPads and Android tablets may eventually replace laptops, but at the moment, there are no configurations of personal device and hardware that will do more than a few things needed in a modern science classroom, and the system is not set up to institute the needed wholesale rebuilding of IT infrastructure in the classroom's learning plan. In fact, the gap between what can be done and what should be done in this case is so large that it could be argued that a rapid transition from laptops and desktops to iPads or Androids is unethical. I would even go so far as to question the motivations of anyone pushing this sort of decision. Let's look at the problem in more detail.

[…]Wal-Mart has signed on to buy 233 megawatts of electricity from EDP’s various wind farms, including 50 megawatts specifically from Harvest Ridge. A local cooperative, the Wabash Valley Power Association, has plans to purchase 100 megawatts for 20 years and a second unidentified private purchaser will buy 50 megawatts for an undisclosed number of years.But a zoning battle that has spilled into court could jeopardize all of that.EDP recently filed a lawsuit against Murdock Township, which last fall created and enacted its own zoning requirements for wind, separate and more restrictive than the Douglas County ordinance that was intended to be countywide.In the lawsuit, EDP attorneys argue that the township ordinances are designed “in a manner in which it would be effectively impossible to develop and permit the project.” The company’s complaint states that Murdock Township’s actions are prejudicial to the project, contrary to zoning authority granted to townships by the Illinois General Assembly and an improper attempt to override the county’s wind-farm ordinance.The governor committed Illinois to the US Climate Alliance just the other day. We’re not going to get there if rural township NIMBYs are setting up arbitrary roadblocks to wind (and solar) power.The state needs reasonable, uniform siting and operational guidelines.

49,National Anthem Protest,Is Refusing to Stand for the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest?,2s49q5r,https://theundefeated.com/features/athletes-and-activism-the-long-defiant-history-of-sports-protests/,"Athletes and activism: The long, defiant history of sports protests","From Ali to Althea Gibson and Bill Russell to LeBron, players have used their platform to spotlight injustice and chosen ceremonial moments to take a standThe history of sports protests goes deep. Back, way back, on Jan. 13, 532 A.D., at the chariot races in Constantinople, rival drivers from the Blues and Greens teams asked the emperor Justinian to pardon two of their followers who had been condemned to die. His refusal led to the Nika Revolt, six weeks of rioting that resulted in the deaths of 30,000 people.So taking a knee during the national anthem isn’t exactly unprecedented, or nearly as calamitous. Athletes in modern times have often been moved to protest conditions, to demonstrate that they are citizens of conscience by speaking truth to power. The following timeline of sports protests begins in 1883 and ends with the crescendo of events leading up to Colin Kaepernick taking a knee in 2016.There have been all sorts of protests about race, gender, money and nationality in American and Olympic sports history, but they all have this in common: the constant struggle for justice, supported by the U.S. Constitution, which turns 230 on March 4.Moses Fleetwood Walker was the first African-American to play pro baseball, six decades before Jackie Robinson broke MLB’s color barrier in 1947.Baseball Hall of FameOn Aug. 10, 1883, Cap Anson, the owner-manager-first baseman of the Chicago White Sox, took his team to Toledo, Ohio, to play an exhibition game. He demanded that the Blue Stockings not play Moses Fleetwood Walker, the African-American catcher. Walker wasn’t going to play anyway because he was injured, but when informed of Anson’s demand, Toledo manager Charlie Morton took a stand and called his bluff, starting Walker in right field. Said Anson, “We’ll play this here game, but won’t play never no more with the n—–.” Toledo joined the American Association the next year, and on May 1, 1884, Walker became the first African-American major leaguer when he took the field against Louisville. Three years later, Anson finally got his way when owners enacted a rule barring black players from professional baseball.Baseball’s “reserve clause” infuriated Hall of Famer John Montgomery Ward, who was also a lawyer and believed that players should be allowed to ply their trade wherever someone was willing to pay them. So he started a rival league.Getty ImagesJohn Montgomery Ward is the only player in the Hall of Fame with 2,000 hits and 100 wins. He also later started a major department chain. But his impact on the business of baseball was huge as well. In the late 1880s, players bridled at the salaries they were being paid under the National League’s reserve clause. Led by Ward, they organized a new league for the 1890 season and got many of the most talented players to sign on. The Players League lasted only one year because it butted heads in the same cities as the National League, but it had far more future Hall of Famers. And it provided a road map that was still useful a century later.Ireland’s Peter O’Connor proved his prowess in the wide jump (now called the long jump) at the 1906 Olympics — then climbed a flagpole armed with an Irish flag in protest.OsmanPhotos.com / Alamy Stock PhotoPeter O’Connor, an Irish long jumper, finished second in the 1906 Games in Athens but first in the history of Olympic flag protests. He had gone to Greece believing he was representing Ireland, but when he got there, he was told there would be no Irish team, just one from Great Britain. So as the Union Jack was raised for him, he scaled the flagpole as teammate Con Leahy stood guard at the base. When he reached the top, he unfurled the green Irish flag he had smuggled onto the track. Emblazoned with a gold harp, shamrocks and the words “Erin Go Bragh,” the flag had an entirely different meaning.Paul Robeson was an All-American for Rutgers in 1917.AP PhotoLong before he became a famous actor, singer and firebrand, Paul Robeson was a student trying out for the Rutgers football team. He made the team after enduring a brutal initiation rite in intrasquad scrimmages, but there was still the matter of what other teams might do when faced with a 6-foot-2, 210-pound black man on the other side. For its Oct. 14, 1916, game at Rutgers, Washington and Lee asked coach Foster Sanford to bench him, and Sanford complied, even though the score ended in a 13-13 tie. Robeson later told a friend that the benching was “a wound that never healed.” But after his teammates voiced their objections, Sanford had a change of heart, and when West Virginia made the same request a month later, he refused. Robeson made a game-saving tackle to preserve a 0-0 tie and earned this accolade from Mountaineers coach Mont McIntire: “Guts! He had nothing else but. Why, that colored boy’s legs were so gashed and bruised that his skin peeled off when he was removing his stockings.”Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to successfully swim the English Channel.Getty ImagesOn Aug. 6, 1926, 19-year-old Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel. It took her 14 hours, 34 minutes and a change of coaches — the first one actually tried to sabotage her initial effort. In a decade in which female athletes emerged to challenge stereotypes, Ederle’s feat was the signal accomplishment. Legend has it that her hearing was affected by the Channel swim. She spent much of her long life — she died in 2014 at age 98 — teaching deaf children how to swim.Olympic broad jump medalists — bronze medalist Jajima of Japan (left), gold medalist Jesse Owens (center) of the United States and silver medalist Lutz Long (right) of Germany — saluted in different ways during the medal ceremony at the 1936 Berlin Games.AP PhotoThe 1936 Berlin Games forced American athletes to decide how best to object to Adolf Hitler’s Aryan agenda. Harvard track star Milton Green, fencer Albert Wolff of France and basketball players from Long Island University chose not to participate in protest of the virulent anti-Semitism in Germany. On the other hand, track stars Jesse Owens and Mack Robinson elected to compete to put a lie to Hitler’s precepts of a master race.Owens won four gold medals, of course, infuriating Hitler. Robinson, the older brother of future sports pioneer Jackie Robinson, finished second in the 200 meters behind Owens. What was the silver medal worth? Robinson found out it wasn’t worth much — the only job that he could find when he returned was as a street sweeper in his hometown of Pasadena, California.In a silent but eloquent protest, Robinson wore his Olympic jacket while working in a white neighborhood during the evenings. The response from residents also said a lot about America — they got the cops to make him take off the jacket.Twenty years after teaching the West Virginia football team a lesson, Robeson gave mainstream America a more profound one by singing “Ol’ Man River” in the movie Show Boat. The music was by Jerome Kern, the lyrics were by Oscar Hammerstein II and the film was directed by James Whale, but it’s the performance by Robeson that still strikes the chord of injustice.Leonard Bates, a star fullback for New York University, was not allowed to play in a 1940 game at the University of Missouri.Courtesy NYUThe University of Missouri asked that New York University not use African-American fullback Leonard Bates in a November 1940 football game, and NYU acceded to the request. After NYU players brought the matter up at a student council meeting, seven students decided to protest the university’s complicity in discrimination against black athletes … and were suspended for three months in 1941. Sixty years later, NYU honored them for their commitment to social justice.Jackie Robinson (right) — with fellow Brooklyn Dodgers infielders (from left) Spike Jorgensen, Pee Wee Reese and Eddie Stanky — broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947 to become the first African-American major leaguer.AP PhotoSome might argue that the Brooklyn Dodgers’ decision to integrate baseball wasn’t a protest. But in retrospect, this act of courage by Jackie Robinson and of defiance by general manager Branch Rickey may have been the single most successful demonstration for racial equality in American history. Robinson had to walk through a cauldron of hatred to show he belonged and to open the doors for African-Americans in every walk of life.Althea Gibson (left) took reigning Wimbledon champion Louise Brough (right) to three sets before Brough prevailed 6-1, 3-6, 9-7 in the 1950 national tennis championships in Forest Hills, New York.Getty ImagesNo African-American had ever competed in the US Open, but Florida A&M’s Althea Gibson was clearly worthy of an invitation. As the tennis world waited to see if the country club set at the United States Lawn Tennis Association would extend one, four-time national champion Alice Marble weighed in with a letter that appeared in the July 1950 issue of American Lawn Tennis magazine. Noting that a committee member had told her Gibson would be judged on her performance in invitational tournaments, to which she wasn’t being invited, Marble wrote:“Miss Gibson is over a very cunningly wrought barrel. … She is not being judged by the yardstick of ability, but by the fact that her pigmentation is somewhat different. She is a fellow tennis player, and, as such, deserving of the chance to prove herself.”The letter rocked the tennis world and opened the door for Gibson. At the US Open that September, she had to face Louise Brough, the reigning Wimbledon champion, as hecklers in the grandstand shouted, “Knock her out of there!” and “Beat the n—–!” Gibson kept her poise and might have won had a thunderstorm not given Brough a much-needed respite. After the match ended with Brough winning the third set 9-7, there was no denying that Gibson belonged.Jackie Robinson (left) was one of the marshals of the Youth March for Integrated Schools demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 25, 1958, along with dancer Julie Robinson (second from right), and her husband, singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte (far right).Abbie Rowe/Getty ImagesRobinson was not satisfied with opening the doors for Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Althea Gibson. Ignoring the advice of sportswriters who thought he should know his place, Robinson also became a civil rights leader, organizing the Youth March for Integrated Schools with Martin Luther King Jr. Their goal was to get a thousand students, black and white, to march on the Lincoln Memorial. The protest drew 10,000.After leading a boycott of a Boston Celtics exhibition game in Louisville, Kentucky, Bill Russell (center), shown at NAACP headquarters in 1964, used his platform as a professional athlete to speak out against discrimination.Hal Sweeney/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesWhile in Lexington, Kentucky, for an exhibition before the 1961-62 season, Bill Russell and the other black members of the Boston Celtics were refused service at a restaurant. They boycotted the game, a groundbreaking statement at a time when blacks were still expected not to complain publicly about discrimination. Russell became an outspoken advocate for integration — after the 1963 assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi, he flew down to Jackson to conduct integrated basketball camps.Black players on the East (top photo) and West (bottom photo) teams at the 1965 American Football League All-Star Game answered the prejudice they faced in New Orleans by voting to boycott the game.Getty ImagesThe AFL All-Star Game was scheduled to be played in New Orleans at Tulane Stadium on Jan. 16, 1965. But when the 21 black players arrived in the city, they were met with hostility and denials of service — they couldn’t even get cab rides from the airport. With the support of white AFL stars such as Buffalo quarterback Jack Kemp, a future Republican candidate for vice president, and San Diego offensive tackle Ron Mix, the players told AFL commissioner Joe Foss that they would not play in New Orleans. So the game was moved to Houston.Despite a race official’s attempt to stop her, Kathrine Switzer (center) stayed the course and became the first woman to officially run the Boston Marathon.Paul Connell/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesNo women had been allowed to compete in the 70 years of the Boston Marathon. But after seeing no such restriction in the race rules and signing in as K.V. Switzer, seasoned runner Kathrine “Kathy” Switzer was issued an official number. Two miles into the race, Boston Marathon official Jock Semple jumped off the press bus to pull her off the course — but couldn’t because of her determination. Her time of 4 hours, 20 minutes wouldn’t have set a record … except that it did.Detroit Tigers outfielder Willie Horton tried to bring peace, while still in uniform, during the 1967 riots in Detroit.Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesOn July 23, 1967, Willie Horton hit a home run and single to lead the Detroit Tigers to a 7-3 victory over the New York Yankees. But out on the streets, the citizens of Detroit were rioting, and Horton, who grew up in the Motor City, believed he had to do something. So he walked out of the stadium in his uniform and headed to his old neighborhood at 12th Street and Clairmount Avenue to try to quell the riots.Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown presided over a meeting of top African-American athletes who supported boxer Muhammad Ali’s refusal to fight in Vietnam. Pictured: (front row, from left to right) Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, Brown, Lew Alcindor; (back row from left to right) Carl Stokes, Walter Beach, Bobby Mitchell, Sid Williams, Curtis McClinton, Willie Davis, Jim Shorter and John Wooten.Tony Tomsic/AP PhotoOn June 4, Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor and other prominent black athletes met in Cleveland in a show of support for Muhammad Ali, who had refused induction into the U.S. Army as a conscientious objector. Two weeks later, he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison and stripped of his heavyweight title.But Ali counter punched in the courts as others fought with him. Alcindor, in particular, emerged as a force for change. The NCAA basketball rules committee had just taken the dunk away from Alcindor and UCLA. The committee said it was to restore competitive balance, but the ban clearly had a target. “To me, the new no-dunk rule smacks a little of discrimination,” Alcindor told the Chicago Defender. “Most of the people who dunk are black athletes.”Americans Tommie Smith (center) and John Carlos (right) raise their gloved fists in a human rights protest during their medal ceremony at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City on Oct. 16, 1968.Rich Clarkson/Getty ImagesThe 200-meter final at the Mexico City Games became as fraught with significance as the 200 meters final at the 1936 Berlin Games. After Tommie Smith won gold and John Carlos silver, they stepped onto the podium shoeless but decked out in black socks and gloves. Then they raised their fists above their bowed heads to silently protest racial discrimination.A superlative center fielder on three pennant-winning St. Louis Cardinals teams, Curt Flood challenged baseball’s reserve clause in 1969 — and changed the sport forever.Getty ImagesIn 1889, John Montgomery Ward challenged baseball’s reserve clause. Eighty years later, when the Cardinals traded All-Star center fielder Curt Flood to the Philadelphia Phillies, Flood filed an antitrust suit against MLB, saying that being owned by a baseball team was akin to “being a slave 100 years ago.” He took the case all the way to the Supreme Court in 1972, sacrificing the last years of his career, and though he lost the case, he helped gain economic freedom for the next generation of players.A group of players who came to be called the “Syracuse 8″ sacrificed their college and future pro careers by speaking out against racial discrimination on the Syracuse football team.Courtesy Syracuse UniversityThey came to be known as the Syracuse 8, but there were actually nine African-Americans on the Syracuse football team who decided to sit out the 1970 season in an effort to bring racial equality to a program that had produced Pro Football Hall of Famers Jim Brown and John Mackey and 1961 Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis. Among their demands were better medical care and stronger academic support for all student-athletes, fair intrasquad competition and the integration of the coaching staff. Head coach Ben Schwartzwalder actually joked about finding a black assistant: “I looked for one on the way home, and I looked for one on the way back to coaching, and I couldn’t find any.”The nine players, some of whom could’ve played in the NFL, turned their focus to academics, and their protest galvanized the faculty and brought about grudging changes to the football program. In 2006, Syracuse gave the group the Chancellor’s Medal … and the letterman jackets they should have been given 36 years before.For the first time in U.S. sports history, players went on strike in 1972. Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Marvin Miller showed owners that they could not pressure players such as Boston’s Gary Peters, Los Angeles’ Wes Parker and St. Louis’ Joe Torre to turn against their union.AP PhotoEighty-two years after the first player revolt, Major League Baseball found itself in a pickle. The owners thought they had the upper hand, but the players had a new champion in Marvin Miller. All they really wanted was an increase in pension benefits to keep pace with inflation, but the owners wouldn’t budge. So, backed by a near-unanimous vote of the 48 player reps, they walked out, and baseball lost 86 games and a good portion of its fan base — who did the players think they were?The only beneficiaries were the Detroit Tigers, who nipped the Boston Red Sox by a half-game because the unbalanced schedule gave them one more.College basketball (and later NBA) star Bill Walton was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest on UCLA’s Westwood campus.Courtesy UCLAOn May 9, 1972, fresh from UCLA’s undefeated college basketball season, center Bill Walton took part in a large demonstration on the Westwood campus to protest President Richard Nixon’s decision to escalate the war in Vietnam. Backed by the Students for a Democratic Society, more than 1,000 demonstrators demanded that classes be shut down, cut down both California and U.S. colors from flagpoles and marched to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran Avenue to stage a sit-in. Told by police that it would be an unlawful assembly, the crowd calmly dispersed. Walton was one of the last 50 students who sat at the intersection.While accepting an award in 1972 commemorating the 25th anniversary of his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Jackie Robinson (left) called out MLB for its lack of black managers.AP PhotoHonored before Game 2 of the World Series in Cincinnati, Jackie Robinson thanked the crowd, then took the opportunity to point out that something was missing in baseball: “I am going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I see a black face managing in baseball.” Robinson died nine days later, but two years to the day after he said those words, Frank Robinson was hired as the manager of the Cleveland Indians.The eight members of the all-black cheerleading squad for Brown refused to stand for the national anthem before a March 8, 1973, game with Providence College, saying the flag no longer represented them. The Providence City Council censured the women and denounced the university, but Brown’s president, Donald Hornig, defended them, citing their right to free expression.When Arthur Ashe (left) fought to play tennis in apartheid South Africa, he faced bitter criticism, but he said the trip was “an attempt to put a crack in the racist wall down there.”AP PhotoBecause of its apartheid policies, South Africa was boycotted by the international sports community. Tennis great Arthur Ashe decided to put a different spin on the resistance by offering to go to South Africa to play. In 1973, on his third attempt, he was finally granted a visa. Some labeled him an “Uncle Tom” for traveling there, but unbeknownst to his critics, Ashe negotiated with the government to integrate seating at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where he was playing. The black fans who saw him win the doubles title there called him “Sipho,” which is Xhosa for “gift from God.”A social activist on and off the court, Bille Jean King (left) battled former tennis champion Bobby Riggs (right) before a sellout crowd of 30,000 at the Houston Astrodome and 50 million viewers on TV in September 1973.Getty Images1973 was also the year in which Billie Jean King brought equality to women’s tennis. In June, she organized the Women’s Tennis Association. Soon thereafter, she threatened to lead a boycott of the US Open if the prize money for winning the finals was not the same for men and women: $25,000. And in September she played Bobby Riggs in “The Battle of the Sexes,” easily beating the former men’s champion to make her point.A 1976 protest by the Yale University rowing team — from left to right: Gloria Graz, Jackie Zoch, Nancy Storrs, Chris Ernst and Carol Brown — helped define Title IX.Stan Grossfeld/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesTwo-time Olympic rower Chris Ernst led 18 of her teammates in a dramatic protest against Yale University’s lack of athletic facilities for women. They marched into the office of the women’s athletic director, read a statement, then took off to their tops to reveal “Title IX” written in blue marker on their backs and sternums.Among the indignities they faced at Yale was having to wait on the bus at the boathouse while the less successful men’s team showered first — there was no hot water in the trailer showers they were given. After a story about the protest appeared in The New York Times, it was the Yale administration that got into hot water.President Jimmy Carter tells a group of about 150 U.S. Olympic athletes and officials that the United States will not go to the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Getty ImagesAthletes were dragged into a protest called by one man for an entire nation: On March 21, 1980, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would be boycotting the Olympics in Moscow. The Soviet Union had failed to heed Carter’s demand that it withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, so he refused to play their games. While Canada, Japan and West Germany joined the U.S., other allies such as Great Britain, France and Greece decided to go. American Olympians, who were threatened with the loss of their passports if they competed as individuals, weren’t the only ones left holding the bag. NBC took a financial bath.The inaugural Gay Olympic Games took place in San Francisco in 1982 in the form of a sports competition and arts festival.Federation of Gay Games RecordsAfter finishing sixth in the decathlon at the 1968 Mexico City Games, Tom Waddell became a physician and gay rights advocate in San Francisco. After joining a gay bowling league, Waddell decided to organize a gay Olympics in San Francisco that began on Aug. 28, 1982, with Tina Turner singing the national anthem. The International Olympic Committee sued to have Waddell remove the word “Olympics” from the event, but the competition, renamed the Gay Games, was a resounding success. Although Waddell would die of AIDS in 1987, his brainchild continues to thrive every four years.After a players strike significantly shortened the 1982 season, the New Orleans Saints offered a view of the 57-day work stoppage.Elliott Kamonitz/AP PhotoAfter three previous strikes ended in the preseason, the NFL players finally succeeded in causing the cancellation of actual games. They wanted a wage scale based upon 55 percent of gross revenues, and the owners would not budge. So, for seven weeks, the NFL went dark as the players staged a pair of “All-Star Games” and NBC picked up the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN. When the two sides reached agreement on a five-year deal, they mounted a nine-game schedule for each team that culminated in a Super Bowl “tournament” involving 16 teams. The Super Bowl champs were the Washington Redskins, with Joe Theismann at quarterback.Georgetown coach John Thompson (center) walked off the court before his Georgetown Hoyas were to play Boston College to protest Proposition 42.Suzy Mast/AP PhotoOn Jan. 14, 1989, Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson walked off the court before a home game against Boston College. He was protesting a new NCAA rule, Proposition 42, that denied scholarships to freshmen who were academically ineligible. “If these kids today don’t get that opportunity, who are they going to look to? I had to reassure myself I was doing the right thing. … I’m sure now I’m right.” Other influential coaches backed Thompson up, saying the rule targeted black athletes, and the NCAA later rescinded it.Craig Hodges twice led the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage, but the Chicago Bulls guard was released from the league after he wore a dashiki and took a letter for President George Bush to the White House.Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty ImagesCraig Hodges was a 3-point specialist who helped the Chicago Bulls win their first two titles in the ’90s. He was also a social activist and a Muslim, and when the Bulls were invited to the White House after winning the ’92 NBA title, he wore a dashiki. He also respectfully handed President George Bush a letter in which he expressed his concern about racism in America and his opposition to Operation Desert Storm. Shortly after the visit, he was released because, the Bulls said, he couldn’t play defense.Arthur Ashe was arrested and escorted away by a police officer at a rally sponsored by the NAACP and TransAfrica that protested President George Bush’s policy of returning Haitian refugees to Haiti.Ron Edmonds/AP PhotoArthur Ashe was suffering from AIDS. But he took up the cause of Haitian immigrants who were being denied entry into the United States because of America’s fear of the disease. On Sept. 10, 1992, he participated in a demonstration at the White House backed by a banner that read: “HAITIANS LOCKED OUT BECAUSE THEY’RE BLACK.” When the police came to break up the protest, they arrested the 1968 US Open champion and strapped his arms around his back.Ashe died five months later. Inspired by Ashe, the Detroit Pistons’ Haitian center, Olden Polynice, then took up the cause.After Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (center) refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner” before games, saying that the flag was a symbol of oppression and that the United States had a long history of tyranny, the NBA suspended him.Michael S. Green/AP PhotoDenver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf was having the best season of his career when he decided to stop standing for the national anthem. On March 12, 1996, NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Abdul-Rauf for his protest. They soon came to an agreement: He could close his eyes and look downward during the anthem. From then on, Abdul-Rauf did just that, saying a Muslin prayer to himself with his eyes closed.While he showed due respect, two Denver disc jockeys trespassed on a mosque to play the national anthem with their trumpets. Five years later, arsonists burned down Abdul-Rauf’s home in Gulfport, Mississippi.Toni Smith, a 21-year-old sociology major and basketball player at Manhattanville College, turned her back to the flag as the pregame anthem played in silent protest of America’s potential involvement in the Iraq War.Stuart Ramson/AP PhotoIn 2003, Toni Smith, a senior guard for the Manhattanville College women’s basketball team, turned her back to the U.S. flag during the anthem to protest the U.S. involvement in the war in Iraq. When word got out of her act of conscience, she became the focus of a national debate.Blue Jays first baseman Carlos Delgado quietly carried out a personal anti-war protest throughout the 2004 season, refusing to stand when “God Bless America” was played at ballparks across the majors.Frank Franklin II/AP PhotoDuring the Iraq War, baseball began a new tradition by playing “God Bless America” during the seventh-inning stretch.

Thomas/Getty ImagesMore than 30 members of the University of Missouri football team announced during a bye week on Nov. 8, 2015, that they would be boycotting practices and games until university president Tim Wolfe resigned. They, and Jonathan Butler, a 25-year-old African-American graduate student who had begun a hunger strike, believed that Wolfe’s response to a spate of racial incidents on campus had been inadequate. Wolfe did resign. (Seventy-five years earlier, Missouri officials had demanded that NYU not play black fullback Leonard Bates.)From left to right: Minnesota Lynx players Lindsay Whalen, Maya Moore, Rebekkah Brunson and Seimone Augustus wore shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement during warm-ups on July 9, 2016.David Sherman/NBAE/Getty ImagesIn July 2016, members of the Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty and Phoenix Mercury began wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts to WNBA games to protest recent police shootings. Police unions took offense, and the league fined both the teams and the players. But after Liberty center Tina Charles took to Twitter to say that she refused “to be silent,” WNBA president Lisa Borders rescinded the fines and began a dialogue, saying, “While we expect players to comply with league rules and uniform guidelines, we also understand their desire to use their platforms to address important social issues.”Marathon silver medalist Feyisa Lilesa made a gesture at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games that had been used by Oromo people in his home country of Ethiopia as a sign of protest.OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Feyisa Lilesa crossed the finish line second in the marathon at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games on Aug. 21, 2016, the Ethiopian runner crossed his arms above his head to protest the treatment of his Oromo people by his country’s government. He then went into exile. But Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo descent, recently invited him back to receive a hero’s welcome.San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest police shootings of African-American men and other social injustices faced by black people in the United States by sitting, then kneeling, during the national anthem before games in 2016 sparked controversy.Chris Carlson/AP Photo Raptors superfan Drake is the NBA’s biggest celebrity playoff antagonist — and he won’t stop anytime soon Read now WNBA Kicks proving female players are sneakerheads too Read now Raptors president Masai Ujiri got Toronto on the verge of NBA Finals while also focusing on Africa Read now On Aug. 26, 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before his preseason debut against the Green Bay Packers. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said after the game. “To me this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.”Home of the brave?

Athletes and activism: The long, defiant history of sports protests From Ali to Althea Gibson and Bill Russell to LeBron, players have used their platform to spotlight injustice and chosen ceremonial moments to take a standThe history of sports protests goes deep. Back, way back, on Jan. 13, 532 A.D., at the chariot races in Constantinople, rival drivers from the Blues and Greens teams asked the emperor Justinian to pardon two of their followers who had been condemned to die. His refusal led to the Nika Revolt, six weeks of rioting that resulted in the deaths of 30,000 people.So taking a knee during the national anthem isn’t exactly unprecedented, or nearly as calamitous. Athletes in modern times have often been moved to protest conditions, to demonstrate that they are citizens of conscience by speaking truth to power. The following timeline of sports protests begins in 1883 and ends with the crescendo of events leading up to Colin Kaepernick taking a knee in 2016.There have been all sorts of protests about race, gender, money and nationality in American and Olympic sports history, but they all have this in common: the constant struggle for justice, supported by the U.S. Constitution, which turns 230 on March 4.Moses Fleetwood Walker was the first African-American to play pro baseball, six decades before Jackie Robinson broke MLB’s color barrier in 1947.Baseball Hall of FameOn Aug. 10, 1883, Cap Anson, the owner-manager-first baseman of the Chicago White Sox, took his team to Toledo, Ohio, to play an exhibition game. He demanded that the Blue Stockings not play Moses Fleetwood Walker, the African-American catcher. Walker wasn’t going to play anyway because he was injured, but when informed of Anson’s demand, Toledo manager Charlie Morton took a stand and called his bluff, starting Walker in right field. Said Anson, “We’ll play this here game, but won’t play never no more with the n—–.” Toledo joined the American Association the next year, and on May 1, 1884, Walker became the first African-American major leaguer when he took the field against Louisville. Three years later, Anson finally got his way when owners enacted a rule barring black players from professional baseball.Baseball’s “reserve clause” infuriated Hall of Famer John Montgomery Ward, who was also a lawyer and believed that players should be allowed to ply their trade wherever someone was willing to pay them. So he started a rival league.Getty ImagesJohn Montgomery Ward is the only player in the Hall of Fame with 2,000 hits and 100 wins. He also later started a major department chain. But his impact on the business of baseball was huge as well. In the late 1880s, players bridled at the salaries they were being paid under the National League’s reserve clause. Led by Ward, they organized a new league for the 1890 season and got many of the most talented players to sign on. The Players League lasted only one year because it butted heads in the same cities as the National League, but it had far more future Hall of Famers. And it provided a road map that was still useful a century later.Ireland’s Peter O’Connor proved his prowess in the wide jump (now called the long jump) at the 1906 Olympics — then climbed a flagpole armed with an Irish flag in protest.OsmanPhotos.com / Alamy Stock PhotoPeter O’Connor, an Irish long jumper, finished second in the 1906 Games in Athens but first in the history of Olympic flag protests. He had gone to Greece believing he was representing Ireland, but when he got there, he was told there would be no Irish team, just one from Great Britain. So as the Union Jack was raised for him, he scaled the flagpole as teammate Con Leahy stood guard at the base. When he reached the top, he unfurled the green Irish flag he had smuggled onto the track. Emblazoned with a gold harp, shamrocks and the words “Erin Go Bragh,” the flag had an entirely different meaning.Paul Robeson was an All-American for Rutgers in 1917.AP PhotoLong before he became a famous actor, singer and firebrand, Paul Robeson was a student trying out for the Rutgers football team. He made the team after enduring a brutal initiation rite in intrasquad scrimmages, but there was still the matter of what other teams might do when faced with a 6-foot-2, 210-pound black man on the other side. For its Oct. 14, 1916, game at Rutgers, Washington and Lee asked coach Foster Sanford to bench him, and Sanford complied, even though the score ended in a 13-13 tie. Robeson later told a friend that the benching was “a wound that never healed.” But after his teammates voiced their objections, Sanford had a change of heart, and when West Virginia made the same request a month later, he refused. Robeson made a game-saving tackle to preserve a 0-0 tie and earned this accolade from Mountaineers coach Mont McIntire: “Guts! He had nothing else but. Why, that colored boy’s legs were so gashed and bruised that his skin peeled off when he was removing his stockings.”Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to successfully swim the English Channel.Getty ImagesOn Aug. 6, 1926, 19-year-old Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel. It took her 14 hours, 34 minutes and a change of coaches — the first one actually tried to sabotage her initial effort. In a decade in which female athletes emerged to challenge stereotypes, Ederle’s feat was the signal accomplishment. Legend has it that her hearing was affected by the Channel swim. She spent much of her long life — she died in 2014 at age 98 — teaching deaf children how to swim.Olympic broad jump medalists — bronze medalist Jajima of Japan (left), gold medalist Jesse Owens (center) of the United States and silver medalist Lutz Long (right) of Germany — saluted in different ways during the medal ceremony at the 1936 Berlin Games.AP PhotoThe 1936 Berlin Games forced American athletes to decide how best to object to Adolf Hitler’s Aryan agenda. Harvard track star Milton Green, fencer Albert Wolff of France and basketball players from Long Island University chose not to participate in protest of the virulent anti-Semitism in Germany. On the other hand, track stars Jesse Owens and Mack Robinson elected to compete to put a lie to Hitler’s precepts of a master race.Owens won four gold medals, of course, infuriating Hitler. Robinson, the older brother of future sports pioneer Jackie Robinson, finished second in the 200 meters behind Owens. What was the silver medal worth? Robinson found out it wasn’t worth much — the only job that he could find when he returned was as a street sweeper in his hometown of Pasadena, California.In a silent but eloquent protest, Robinson wore his Olympic jacket while working in a white neighborhood during the evenings. The response from residents also said a lot about America — they got the cops to make him take off the jacket.Twenty years after teaching the West Virginia football team a lesson, Robeson gave mainstream America a more profound one by singing “Ol’ Man River” in the movie Show Boat. The music was by Jerome Kern, the lyrics were by Oscar Hammerstein II and the film was directed by James Whale, but it’s the performance by Robeson that still strikes the chord of injustice.Leonard Bates, a star fullback for New York University, was not allowed to play in a 1940 game at the University of Missouri.Courtesy NYUThe University of Missouri asked that New York University not use African-American fullback Leonard Bates in a November 1940 football game, and NYU acceded to the request. After NYU players brought the matter up at a student council meeting, seven students decided to protest the university’s complicity in discrimination against black athletes … and were suspended for three months in 1941. Sixty years later, NYU honored them for their commitment to social justice.Jackie Robinson (right) — with fellow Brooklyn Dodgers infielders (from left) Spike Jorgensen, Pee Wee Reese and Eddie Stanky — broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947 to become the first African-American major leaguer.AP PhotoSome might argue that the Brooklyn Dodgers’ decision to integrate baseball wasn’t a protest. But in retrospect, this act of courage by Jackie Robinson and of defiance by general manager Branch Rickey may have been the single most successful demonstration for racial equality in American history. Robinson had to walk through a cauldron of hatred to show he belonged and to open the doors for African-Americans in every walk of life.Althea Gibson (left) took reigning Wimbledon champion Louise Brough (right) to three sets before Brough prevailed 6-1, 3-6, 9-7 in the 1950 national tennis championships in Forest Hills, New York.Getty ImagesNo African-American had ever competed in the US Open, but Florida A&M’s Althea Gibson was clearly worthy of an invitation. As the tennis world waited to see if the country club set at the United States Lawn Tennis Association would extend one, four-time national champion Alice Marble weighed in with a letter that appeared in the July 1950 issue of American Lawn Tennis magazine. Noting that a committee member had told her Gibson would be judged on her performance in invitational tournaments, to which she wasn’t being invited, Marble wrote:“Miss Gibson is over a very cunningly wrought barrel. … She is not being judged by the yardstick of ability, but by the fact that her pigmentation is somewhat different. She is a fellow tennis player, and, as such, deserving of the chance to prove herself.”The letter rocked the tennis world and opened the door for Gibson. At the US Open that September, she had to face Louise Brough, the reigning Wimbledon champion, as hecklers in the grandstand shouted, “Knock her out of there!” and “Beat the n—–!” Gibson kept her poise and might have won had a thunderstorm not given Brough a much-needed respite. After the match ended with Brough winning the third set 9-7, there was no denying that Gibson belonged.Jackie Robinson (left) was one of the marshals of the Youth March for Integrated Schools demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 25, 1958, along with dancer Julie Robinson (second from right), and her husband, singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte (far right).Abbie Rowe/Getty ImagesRobinson was not satisfied with opening the doors for Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Althea Gibson. Ignoring the advice of sportswriters who thought he should know his place, Robinson also became a civil rights leader, organizing the Youth March for Integrated Schools with Martin Luther King Jr. Their goal was to get a thousand students, black and white, to march on the Lincoln Memorial. The protest drew 10,000.After leading a boycott of a Boston Celtics exhibition game in Louisville, Kentucky, Bill Russell (center), shown at NAACP headquarters in 1964, used his platform as a professional athlete to speak out against discrimination.Hal Sweeney/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesWhile in Lexington, Kentucky, for an exhibition before the 1961-62 season, Bill Russell and the other black members of the Boston Celtics were refused service at a restaurant. They boycotted the game, a groundbreaking statement at a time when blacks were still expected not to complain publicly about discrimination. Russell became an outspoken advocate for integration — after the 1963 assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers in Jackson, Mississippi, he flew down to Jackson to conduct integrated basketball camps.Black players on the East (top photo) and West (bottom photo) teams at the 1965 American Football League All-Star Game answered the prejudice they faced in New Orleans by voting to boycott the game.Getty ImagesThe AFL All-Star Game was scheduled to be played in New Orleans at Tulane Stadium on Jan. 16, 1965. But when the 21 black players arrived in the city, they were met with hostility and denials of service — they couldn’t even get cab rides from the airport. With the support of white AFL stars such as Buffalo quarterback Jack Kemp, a future Republican candidate for vice president, and San Diego offensive tackle Ron Mix, the players told AFL commissioner Joe Foss that they would not play in New Orleans. So the game was moved to Houston.Despite a race official’s attempt to stop her, Kathrine Switzer (center) stayed the course and became the first woman to officially run the Boston Marathon.Paul Connell/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesNo women had been allowed to compete in the 70 years of the Boston Marathon. But after seeing no such restriction in the race rules and signing in as K.V. Switzer, seasoned runner Kathrine “Kathy” Switzer was issued an official number. Two miles into the race, Boston Marathon official Jock Semple jumped off the press bus to pull her off the course — but couldn’t because of her determination. Her time of 4 hours, 20 minutes wouldn’t have set a record … except that it did.Detroit Tigers outfielder Willie Horton tried to bring peace, while still in uniform, during the 1967 riots in Detroit.Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty ImagesOn July 23, 1967, Willie Horton hit a home run and single to lead the Detroit Tigers to a 7-3 victory over the New York Yankees. But out on the streets, the citizens of Detroit were rioting, and Horton, who grew up in the Motor City, believed he had to do something. So he walked out of the stadium in his uniform and headed to his old neighborhood at 12th Street and Clairmount Avenue to try to quell the riots.Hall of Fame running back Jim Brown presided over a meeting of top African-American athletes who supported boxer Muhammad Ali’s refusal to fight in Vietnam. Pictured: (front row, from left to right) Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali, Brown, Lew Alcindor; (back row from left to right) Carl Stokes, Walter Beach, Bobby Mitchell, Sid Williams, Curtis McClinton, Willie Davis, Jim Shorter and John Wooten.Tony Tomsic/AP PhotoOn June 4, Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Lew Alcindor and other prominent black athletes met in Cleveland in a show of support for Muhammad Ali, who had refused induction into the U.S. Army as a conscientious objector. Two weeks later, he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison and stripped of his heavyweight title.But Ali counter punched in the courts as others fought with him. Alcindor, in particular, emerged as a force for change. The NCAA basketball rules committee had just taken the dunk away from Alcindor and UCLA. The committee said it was to restore competitive balance, but the ban clearly had a target. “To me, the new no-dunk rule smacks a little of discrimination,” Alcindor told the Chicago Defender. “Most of the people who dunk are black athletes.”Americans Tommie Smith (center) and John Carlos (right) raise their gloved fists in a human rights protest during their medal ceremony at the Summer Olympics in Mexico City on Oct. 16, 1968.Rich Clarkson/Getty ImagesThe 200-meter final at the Mexico City Games became as fraught with significance as the 200 meters final at the 1936 Berlin Games. After Tommie Smith won gold and John Carlos silver, they stepped onto the podium shoeless but decked out in black socks and gloves. Then they raised their fists above their bowed heads to silently protest racial discrimination.A superlative center fielder on three pennant-winning St. Louis Cardinals teams, Curt Flood challenged baseball’s reserve clause in 1969 — and changed the sport forever.Getty ImagesIn 1889, John Montgomery Ward challenged baseball’s reserve clause. Eighty years later, when the Cardinals traded All-Star center fielder Curt Flood to the Philadelphia Phillies, Flood filed an antitrust suit against MLB, saying that being owned by a baseball team was akin to “being a slave 100 years ago.” He took the case all the way to the Supreme Court in 1972, sacrificing the last years of his career, and though he lost the case, he helped gain economic freedom for the next generation of players.A group of players who came to be called the “Syracuse 8″ sacrificed their college and future pro careers by speaking out against racial discrimination on the Syracuse football team.Courtesy Syracuse UniversityThey came to be known as the Syracuse 8, but there were actually nine African-Americans on the Syracuse football team who decided to sit out the 1970 season in an effort to bring racial equality to a program that had produced Pro Football Hall of Famers Jim Brown and John Mackey and 1961 Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis. Among their demands were better medical care and stronger academic support for all student-athletes, fair intrasquad competition and the integration of the coaching staff. Head coach Ben Schwartzwalder actually joked about finding a black assistant: “I looked for one on the way home, and I looked for one on the way back to coaching, and I couldn’t find any.”The nine players, some of whom could’ve played in the NFL, turned their focus to academics, and their protest galvanized the faculty and brought about grudging changes to the football program. In 2006, Syracuse gave the group the Chancellor’s Medal … and the letterman jackets they should have been given 36 years before.For the first time in U.S. sports history, players went on strike in 1972. Major League Baseball Players Association executive director Marvin Miller showed owners that they could not pressure players such as Boston’s Gary Peters, Los Angeles’ Wes Parker and St. Louis’ Joe Torre to turn against their union.AP PhotoEighty-two years after the first player revolt, Major League Baseball found itself in a pickle. The owners thought they had the upper hand, but the players had a new champion in Marvin Miller. All they really wanted was an increase in pension benefits to keep pace with inflation, but the owners wouldn’t budge. So, backed by a near-unanimous vote of the 48 player reps, they walked out, and baseball lost 86 games and a good portion of its fan base — who did the players think they were?The only beneficiaries were the Detroit Tigers, who nipped the Boston Red Sox by a half-game because the unbalanced schedule gave them one more.College basketball (and later NBA) star Bill Walton was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest on UCLA’s Westwood campus.Courtesy UCLAOn May 9, 1972, fresh from UCLA’s undefeated college basketball season, center Bill Walton took part in a large demonstration on the Westwood campus to protest President Richard Nixon’s decision to escalate the war in Vietnam. Backed by the Students for a Democratic Society, more than 1,000 demonstrators demanded that classes be shut down, cut down both California and U.S. colors from flagpoles and marched to the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran Avenue to stage a sit-in. Told by police that it would be an unlawful assembly, the crowd calmly dispersed. Walton was one of the last 50 students who sat at the intersection.While accepting an award in 1972 commemorating the 25th anniversary of his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Jackie Robinson (left) called out MLB for its lack of black managers.AP PhotoHonored before Game 2 of the World Series in Cincinnati, Jackie Robinson thanked the crowd, then took the opportunity to point out that something was missing in baseball: “I am going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I see a black face managing in baseball.” Robinson died nine days later, but two years to the day after he said those words, Frank Robinson was hired as the manager of the Cleveland Indians.The eight members of the all-black cheerleading squad for Brown refused to stand for the national anthem before a March 8, 1973, game with Providence College, saying the flag no longer represented them. The Providence City Council censured the women and denounced the university, but Brown’s president, Donald Hornig, defended them, citing their right to free expression.When Arthur Ashe (left) fought to play tennis in apartheid South Africa, he faced bitter criticism, but he said the trip was “an attempt to put a crack in the racist wall down there.”AP PhotoBecause of its apartheid policies, South Africa was boycotted by the international sports community. Tennis great Arthur Ashe decided to put a different spin on the resistance by offering to go to South Africa to play. In 1973, on his third attempt, he was finally granted a visa. Some labeled him an “Uncle Tom” for traveling there, but unbeknownst to his critics, Ashe negotiated with the government to integrate seating at Ellis Park in Johannesburg, where he was playing. The black fans who saw him win the doubles title there called him “Sipho,” which is Xhosa for “gift from God.”A social activist on and off the court, Bille Jean King (left) battled former tennis champion Bobby Riggs (right) before a sellout crowd of 30,000 at the Houston Astrodome and 50 million viewers on TV in September 1973.Getty Images1973 was also the year in which Billie Jean King brought equality to women’s tennis. In June, she organized the Women’s Tennis Association. Soon thereafter, she threatened to lead a boycott of the US Open if the prize money for winning the finals was not the same for men and women: $25,000. And in September she played Bobby Riggs in “The Battle of the Sexes,” easily beating the former men’s champion to make her point.A 1976 protest by the Yale University rowing team — from left to right: Gloria Graz, Jackie Zoch, Nancy Storrs, Chris Ernst and Carol Brown — helped define Title IX.Stan Grossfeld/The Boston Globe/Getty ImagesTwo-time Olympic rower Chris Ernst led 18 of her teammates in a dramatic protest against Yale University’s lack of athletic facilities for women. They marched into the office of the women’s athletic director, read a statement, then took off to their tops to reveal “Title IX” written in blue marker on their backs and sternums.Among the indignities they faced at Yale was having to wait on the bus at the boathouse while the less successful men’s team showered first — there was no hot water in the trailer showers they were given. After a story about the protest appeared in The New York Times, it was the Yale administration that got into hot water.President Jimmy Carter tells a group of about 150 U.S. Olympic athletes and officials that the United States will not go to the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Getty ImagesAthletes were dragged into a protest called by one man for an entire nation: On March 21, 1980, President Jimmy Carter announced that the United States would be boycotting the Olympics in Moscow. The Soviet Union had failed to heed Carter’s demand that it withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, so he refused to play their games. While Canada, Japan and West Germany joined the U.S., other allies such as Great Britain, France and Greece decided to go. American Olympians, who were threatened with the loss of their passports if they competed as individuals, weren’t the only ones left holding the bag. NBC took a financial bath.The inaugural Gay Olympic Games took place in San Francisco in 1982 in the form of a sports competition and arts festival.Federation of Gay Games RecordsAfter finishing sixth in the decathlon at the 1968 Mexico City Games, Tom Waddell became a physician and gay rights advocate in San Francisco. After joining a gay bowling league, Waddell decided to organize a gay Olympics in San Francisco that began on Aug. 28, 1982, with Tina Turner singing the national anthem. The International Olympic Committee sued to have Waddell remove the word “Olympics” from the event, but the competition, renamed the Gay Games, was a resounding success. Although Waddell would die of AIDS in 1987, his brainchild continues to thrive every four years.After a players strike significantly shortened the 1982 season, the New Orleans Saints offered a view of the 57-day work stoppage.Elliott Kamonitz/AP PhotoAfter three previous strikes ended in the preseason, the NFL players finally succeeded in causing the cancellation of actual games. They wanted a wage scale based upon 55 percent of gross revenues, and the owners would not budge. So, for seven weeks, the NFL went dark as the players staged a pair of “All-Star Games” and NBC picked up the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN. When the two sides reached agreement on a five-year deal, they mounted a nine-game schedule for each team that culminated in a Super Bowl “tournament” involving 16 teams. The Super Bowl champs were the Washington Redskins, with Joe Theismann at quarterback.Georgetown coach John Thompson (center) walked off the court before his Georgetown Hoyas were to play Boston College to protest Proposition 42.Suzy Mast/AP PhotoOn Jan. 14, 1989, Georgetown basketball coach John Thompson walked off the court before a home game against Boston College. He was protesting a new NCAA rule, Proposition 42, that denied scholarships to freshmen who were academically ineligible. “If these kids today don’t get that opportunity, who are they going to look to? I had to reassure myself I was doing the right thing. … I’m sure now I’m right.” Other influential coaches backed Thompson up, saying the rule targeted black athletes, and the NCAA later rescinded it.Craig Hodges twice led the NBA in 3-point field goal percentage, but the Chicago Bulls guard was released from the league after he wore a dashiki and took a letter for President George Bush to the White House.Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE/Getty ImagesCraig Hodges was a 3-point specialist who helped the Chicago Bulls win their first two titles in the ’90s. He was also a social activist and a Muslim, and when the Bulls were invited to the White House after winning the ’92 NBA title, he wore a dashiki. He also respectfully handed President George Bush a letter in which he expressed his concern about racism in America and his opposition to Operation Desert Storm. Shortly after the visit, he was released because, the Bulls said, he couldn’t play defense.Arthur Ashe was arrested and escorted away by a police officer at a rally sponsored by the NAACP and TransAfrica that protested President George Bush’s policy of returning Haitian refugees to Haiti.Ron Edmonds/AP PhotoArthur Ashe was suffering from AIDS. But he took up the cause of Haitian immigrants who were being denied entry into the United States because of America’s fear of the disease. On Sept. 10, 1992, he participated in a demonstration at the White House backed by a banner that read: “HAITIANS LOCKED OUT BECAUSE THEY’RE BLACK.” When the police came to break up the protest, they arrested the 1968 US Open champion and strapped his arms around his back.Ashe died five months later. Inspired by Ashe, the Detroit Pistons’ Haitian center, Olden Polynice, then took up the cause.After Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (center) refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner” before games, saying that the flag was a symbol of oppression and that the United States had a long history of tyranny, the NBA suspended him.Michael S. Green/AP PhotoDenver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf was having the best season of his career when he decided to stop standing for the national anthem. On March 12, 1996, NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Abdul-Rauf for his protest. They soon came to an agreement: He could close his eyes and look downward during the anthem. From then on, Abdul-Rauf did just that, saying a Muslin prayer to himself with his eyes closed.While he showed due respect, two Denver disc jockeys trespassed on a mosque to play the national anthem with their trumpets. Five years later, arsonists burned down Abdul-Rauf’s home in Gulfport, Mississippi.Toni Smith, a 21-year-old sociology major and basketball player at Manhattanville College, turned her back to the flag as the pregame anthem played in silent protest of America’s potential involvement in the Iraq War.Stuart Ramson/AP PhotoIn 2003, Toni Smith, a senior guard for the Manhattanville College women’s basketball team, turned her back to the U.S. flag during the anthem to protest the U.S. involvement in the war in Iraq.

The statement was criticized by the head of the Cleveland Police Union, who said the Browns owed police an apology.New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony (center) marched to Baltimore City Hall to protest the death of Freddie Gray.Patrick Semansky/AP PhotoNew York Knicks star and Baltimore resident Carmelo Anthony wore a “CASSIUS CLAY” T-shirt as he marched with demonstrators in his hometown on April 30, 2015, to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who had suffered fatal spinal injuries while in police custody 11 days earlier.When Missouri students staged a hunger strike on campus in protest of racial oppression, football players decided to cease football-related activities in solidarity.Michael B. Thomas/Getty ImagesMore than 30 members of the University of Missouri football team announced during a bye week on Nov. 8, 2015, that they would be boycotting practices and games until university president Tim Wolfe resigned. They, and Jonathan Butler, a 25-year-old African-American graduate student who had begun a hunger strike, believed that Wolfe’s response to a spate of racial incidents on campus had been inadequate. Wolfe did resign. (Seventy-five years earlier, Missouri officials had demanded that NYU not play black fullback Leonard Bates.)From left to right: Minnesota Lynx players Lindsay Whalen, Maya Moore, Rebekkah Brunson and Seimone Augustus wore shirts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement during warm-ups on July 9, 2016.David Sherman/NBAE/Getty ImagesIn July 2016, members of the Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty and Phoenix Mercury began wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts to WNBA games to protest recent police shootings. Police unions took offense, and the league fined both the teams and the players. But after Liberty center Tina Charles took to Twitter to say that she refused “to be silent,” WNBA president Lisa Borders rescinded the fines and began a dialogue, saying, “While we expect players to comply with league rules and uniform guidelines, we also understand their desire to use their platforms to address important social issues.”Marathon silver medalist Feyisa Lilesa made a gesture at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games that had been used by Oromo people in his home country of Ethiopia as a sign of protest.OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Feyisa Lilesa crossed the finish line second in the marathon at the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games on Aug. 21, 2016, the Ethiopian runner crossed his arms above his head to protest the treatment of his Oromo people by his country’s government. He then went into exile. But Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, who is of Oromo descent, recently invited him back to receive a hero’s welcome.San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest police shootings of African-American men and other social injustices faced by black people in the United States by sitting, then kneeling, during the national anthem before games in 2016 sparked controversy.Chris Carlson/AP Photo Raptors superfan Drake is the NBA’s biggest celebrity playoff antagonist — and he won’t stop anytime soon Read now WNBA Kicks proving female players are sneakerheads too Read now Raptors president Masai Ujiri got Toronto on the verge of NBA Finals while also focusing on Africa Read now On Aug. 26, 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before his preseason debut against the Green Bay Packers. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he said after the game. “To me this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way.”Home of the brave?

Couple that with the candy and fruity flavors, the ease in which an e-cigarette can be concealed (the most popular e-cigarette is the Juul, which looks like a flash drive and can be charged in a laptop’s USB port) and the fact that vaping doesn’t smell offensive or make a mess, and it’s easy to see why students might be drawn in.

13,Standardized Tests,Is the Use of Standardized Tests Improving Education in America?,1s13q1r,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2019/02/12/new-evidence-of-the-benefits-of-arts-education/,New evidence of the benefits of arts education,"Engaging with art is essential to the human experience. Almost as soon as motor skills are developed, children communicate through artistic expression. The arts challenge us with different points of view, compel us to empathize with “others,” and give us the opportunity to reflect on the human condition. Empirical evidence supports these claims: Among adults, arts participation is related to behaviors that contribute to the health of civil society, such as increased civic engagement, greater social tolerance, and reductions in other-regarding behavior. Yet, while we recognize art’s transformative impacts, its place in K-12 education has become increasingly tenuous.A critical challenge for arts education has been a lack of empirical evidence that demonstrates its educational value. Though few would deny that the arts confer intrinsic benefits, advocating “art for art’s sake” has been insufficient for preserving the arts in schools—despite national surveys showing an overwhelming majority of the public agrees that the arts are a necessary part of a well-rounded education.Over the last few decades, the proportion of students receiving arts education has shrunk drastically. This trend is primarily attributable to the expansion of standardized-test-based accountability, which has pressured schools to focus resources on tested subjects. As the saying goes, what gets measured gets done. These pressures have disproportionately affected access to the arts in a negative way for students from historically underserved communities. For example, a federal government report found that schools designated under No Child Left Behind as needing improvement and schools with higher percentages of minority students were more likely to experience decreases in time spent on arts education.We recently conducted the first ever large-scale, randomized controlled trial study of a city’s collective efforts to restore arts education through community partnerships and investments. Building on our previous investigations of the impacts of enriching arts field trip experiences, this study examines the effects of a sustained reinvigoration of schoolwide arts education. Specifically, our study focuses on the initial two years of Houston’s Arts Access Initiative and includes 42 elementary and middle schools with over 10,000 third- through eighth-grade students. Our study was made possible by generous support of the Houston Endowment, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Spencer Foundation.Due to the program’s gradual rollout and oversubscription, we implemented a lottery to randomly assign which schools initially participated. Half of these schools received substantial influxes of funding earmarked to provide students with a vast array of arts educational experiences throughout the school year. Participating schools were required to commit a monetary match to provide arts experiences. Including matched funds from the Houston Endowment, schools in the treatment group had an average of $14.67 annually per student to facilitate and enhance partnerships with arts organizations and institutions. In addition to arts education professional development for school leaders and teachers, students at the 21 treatment schools received, on average, 10 enriching arts educational experiences across dance, music, theater, and visual arts disciplines. Schools partnered with cultural organizations and institutions that provided these arts learning opportunities through before- and after-school programs, field trips, in-school performances from professional artists, and teaching-artist residencies. Principals worked with the Arts Access Initiative director and staff to help guide arts program selections that aligned with their schools’ goals.Our research efforts were part of a multisector collaboration that united district administrators, cultural organizations and institutions, philanthropists, government officials, and researchers. Collective efforts similar to Houston’s Arts Access Initiative have become increasingly common means for supplementing arts education opportunities through school-community partnerships. Other examples include Boston’s Arts Expansion Initiative, Chicago’s Creative Schools Initiative, and Seattle’s Creative Advantage.Through our partnership with the Houston Education Research Consortium, we obtained access to student-level demographics, attendance and disciplinary records, and test score achievement, as well as the ability to collect original survey data from all 42 schools on students’ school engagement and social and emotional-related outcomes.We find that a substantial increase in arts educational experiences has remarkable impacts on students’ academic, social, and emotional outcomes. Relative to students assigned to the control group, treatment school students experienced a 3.6 percentage point reduction in disciplinary infractions, an improvement of 13 percent of a standard deviation in standardized writing scores, and an increase of 8 percent of a standard deviation in their compassion for others. In terms of our measure of compassion for others, students who received more arts education experiences are more interested in how other people feel and more likely to want to help people who are treated badly.When we restrict our analysis to elementary schools, which comprised 86 percent of the sample and were the primary target of the program, we also find that increases in arts learning positively and significantly affect students’ school engagement, college aspirations, and their inclinations to draw upon works of art as a means for empathizing with others. In terms of school engagement, students in the treatment group were more likely to agree that school work is enjoyable, makes them think about things in new ways, and that their school offers programs, classes, and activities that keep them interested in school. We generally did not find evidence to suggest significant impacts on students’ math, reading, or science achievement, attendance, or our other survey outcomes, which we discuss in our full report.As education policymakers increasingly rely on empirical evidence to guide and justify decisions, advocates struggle to make the case for the preservation and restoration of K-12 arts education. To date, there is a remarkable lack of large-scale experimental studies that investigate the educational impacts of the arts. One problem is that U.S. school systems rarely collect and report basic data that researchers could use to assess students’ access and participation in arts educational programs. Moreover, the most promising outcomes associated with arts education learning objectives extend beyond commonly reported outcomes such as math and reading test scores. There are strong reasons to suspect that engagement in arts education can improve school climate, empower students with a sense of purpose and ownership, and enhance mutual respect for their teachers and peers. Yet, as educators and policymakers have come to recognize the importance of expanding the measures we use to assess educational effectiveness, data measuring social and emotional benefits are not widely collected. Future efforts should continue to expand on the types of measures used to assess educational program and policy effectiveness.These findings provide strong evidence that arts educational experiences can produce significant positive impacts on academic and social development. Because schools play a pivotal role in cultivating the next generation of citizens and leaders, it is imperative that we reflect on the fundamental purpose of a well-rounded education. This mission is critical in a time of heightened intolerance and pressing threats to our core democratic values. As policymakers begin to collect and value outcome measures beyond test scores, we are likely to further recognize the value of the arts in the fundamental mission of education.

16,Teacher Tenure,Should Teachers Get Tenure?,2s16q8r,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/02/20/dr-yelena-yesha-pushing-technology-boundaries-to-solve-the-worlds-biggest-problems-part-ii/,Dr. Yelena Yesha: Pushing Technology Boundaries To Solve The World's Biggest Problems (Part II),"Dr. Yelena Yesha, UMBCDr. Yelena Yesha enhanced by CogWorldDr. Yelena Yesha is a Distinguished University Professor in the Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Her curriculum vitae stretches over a mile, detailing her accomplishments in technology in the last 25 years. Her triumphs with NASA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS), IBM, her leadership in the recent launch of the NSF Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA) at UMBC, plus her personal pursuits in developing solutions in healthcare, and now the recent launch of her blockchain company Softhread, are glimpses into the life of a leader intent on changing the world. I met with Dr. Yelena Yesha to learn about the woman and her journey that chronicles the events that have led to her influence today.This is a Part II of a two-part series. Part I  follows Dr. Yelena Yesha’s journey as a youngster in Ukraine to her life and academic pursuits in Canada and the US.Dr. Yesha realized that university wouldn’t be sufficient to realize her dreams. She wanted to build products. She remembers her early passion to pursue innovations in computer-based diagnosis. She would soon be invited to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the U.S. Department of Commerce and NASA to give lectures. I started to consult for NIST and was one of the first people involved in electronic commerce. We were working there on the concept of global marketplaces for small and medium enterprises. Our division was creating an environment where small businesses in the U.S. would be able to compete effectively with large corporations. My role was to look at the architecture and database issues and determine the opportunities.Dr. Yesha was offered and accepted the directorship of the Center for Applied Information Technology (CAIT) at NIST in charge of the procurement design for electronic commerce systems across all federal agencies. She was only 31 years old.At that time, Dr. Yesha was still an assistant professor, with a road to tenure. Her intent was to return to secure her tenure.I was just offered this position in the federal government with the highest technical grade. I wanted to go on leave to do this. It was unusual to leave while you were on tenure track. However, I was adamant I’d get tenure and I promised to bring back more prestige and new opportunities to the university.Dr. Yesha was granted leave, and assumed her role as the director of CAIT, designing architecture for all the federal agencies to procure products and services through e-commerce.Dr. Yesha’s meaningful contribution to electronic commerce at a time when it was transformative put her in a position of influence. She represented the U.S. at the G7 Summit, leading the development of resources and co-authored books on Electronic Commerce to train the next generation of scientists, and to determine the impacts on policy, governance, and compliance. Dr. Yesha received funding from the European Union and NSF to build a Master of Science in Electronic Commerce Program across Europe. The electronic commerce courses were run online through IBM, Rutgers, Dalhousie, Toronto and 12 business schools in Europe, and became an important component of the electronic commerce curriculums during the internet boom, 1997-2001. She simultaneously led the development of programs to re-educate the American workforce and train K-12 teachers in the use of internet technology. At this time Dr. Yesha was 32 and received early tenure at UMBC.Sometime later, Yelena was offered and accepted the directorship of the NASA Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences (CESDIS):The candidates I competed with were all men – and were much more well known at the time. I was gaining increased prominence for my work at NIST and NASA, however my contenders were already shining stars. I was eventually selected for the position and this was, by far, my most demanding role, and the male-dominated environment at NASA during this time made it even more challenging. At the center, I inherited approximately 28 active projects, and managed a large number of Ph.D. level scientists including astrophysicists. We were equipped with the fourth most powerful supercomputer in the world, attached to the largest unclassified data archive in the world.In 5 years at NASA, Dr. Yesha was able to build successes overseeing:Jacob Slonim was the founder of the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) at IBM Toronto Lab. He learned of Dr. Yesha’s work on electronic commerce and invited her to come to IBM, coaxing her to participate in research on electronic commerce and database. Dr. Yesha began to make her mark at IBM by participating in the development of DB2, a scalable relational database system able to run on a number of authoritative operating systems like Linux, Windows, etc. Dr. Yesha’s influence prompted commercial adoption by NASA. She also contributed to other notable projects like Eclipse, an IT integrated development environment (IDE), which is now the most widely used Java IDE; In 2000 Dr. Yesha co-edited (with Weidong Kou) the very first IBM Press book, “Electronic Commerce Technology Trends: Challenges and Opportunities”.The Multicore revolution began in 2007. Rod Adkins, Senior Vice President of IBM at the time, gave UMBC the mandate of benchmarking and evangelizing the technology, with Dr. Yesha as the Principal Investigator. By 2009, through UMBC, Dr. Yesha and Dr. Milt Halem together founded the National Science Foundation Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR), a 15-year award that promoted a consortium including universities, industry, and government to work on programs of national significance that have commercial value.Some of CHMPR accomplishments Dr. Yesha oversaw include:Dr. Yesha recounts her passion when she first came to Canada: using information technology to address major healthcare challenges.I had a significant role in designing the operating room of the future, building surgical simulations to train the next generation of surgeons. Funding that I received from several agencies enabled me to do this work. This is what I wanted to do all my life... Now I can.Dr. Yesha, not one to limit her opportunities, was asked by a colleague to bridge the gap between computer science and medical research in a way that hadn’t yet been achieved. In 2004, Dr. Yesha began working on personalized medicine to determine new ways the clinical decision support systems could enable more patient-centric solutions. Using machine learning, Dr. Yesha and her collaborators were able to tease out specific features pertinent to individual diseases while mitigating any confusion of interactions among several diseases, and, in the process, improve the accuracy of diagnosis.Once this was completed, the team focused on relevant treatment for patient-specific indications. By combining the patient’s clinical records and diagnosis with his/her genomic information, the team used machine learning to bring an internet feed directly to the physician, which included search results for the most recent and relevant clinical findings and articles from publications in medical journals and CAS, etc.,The importance of AI for medical innovation is on the rise… We started working on the ability to combine clinical and genetic records.  By combining computer science and medicine, we will be able to build a clinical decision support system that produces a holistic view of the patient, fusing clinical and genetic information and using the power of real-time computing to empower the physician at the point of care… This would free up the doctor to focus on quality patient care from better information.Dr. Yesha realized what the industry wanted:Big Data is too broad a term. So I proposed the development of a new center to capture more actionable knowledge from Big Data in real time: the Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA). The current Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research is now in year 10. I decided to phase it out it and start CARTA.In early 2018, CARTA competed for and won a 15-year NSF funding. Its vision is to enable real-time analytics leveraged by smart data. The real value to the industry will be the “automated ingestion and simultaneous analytics” of Big Datasets, in particular for cyberspace, healthcare, IoT and self-learning. Dr. Yelena’s belief is that the future society will be enabled by 3 technologies:Three transformative technologies will revolutionize the way we use, teach, consume and enable computing capabilities: 1) Quantum Computing 2) AI and 3) Blockchain. These technologies are here to stay and will enable significant changes to society. Quantum computing as a platform will change the way developers program computers, while undoubtedly dramatically improving performance. This will require new training for programmers and effective users of the platform. For industry, the leap forward will be evident. As well, AI, at a mass market level, will make its biggest impact in robotics. Blockchain will have an influence in reforming many aspects of computing. And the prime ROI will be achieved in the supply chain, Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity. Most blockchain solutions will require customization based on domain expertise.

Dr. Yelena Yesha: Pushing Technology Boundaries To Solve The World's Biggest Problems (Part II) Dr. Yelena Yesha, UMBCDr. Yelena Yesha enhanced by CogWorldDr. Yelena Yesha is a Distinguished University Professor in the Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Her curriculum vitae stretches over a mile, detailing her accomplishments in technology in the last 25 years. Her triumphs with NASA, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS), IBM, her leadership in the recent launch of the NSF Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA) at UMBC, plus her personal pursuits in developing solutions in healthcare, and now the recent launch of her blockchain company Softhread, are glimpses into the life of a leader intent on changing the world. I met with Dr. Yelena Yesha to learn about the woman and her journey that chronicles the events that have led to her influence today.This is a Part II of a two-part series. Part I  follows Dr. Yelena Yesha’s journey as a youngster in Ukraine to her life and academic pursuits in Canada and the US.Dr. Yesha realized that university wouldn’t be sufficient to realize her dreams. She wanted to build products. She remembers her early passion to pursue innovations in computer-based diagnosis. She would soon be invited to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) at the U.S. Department of Commerce and NASA to give lectures. I started to consult for NIST and was one of the first people involved in electronic commerce. We were working there on the concept of global marketplaces for small and medium enterprises. Our division was creating an environment where small businesses in the U.S. would be able to compete effectively with large corporations. My role was to look at the architecture and database issues and determine the opportunities.Dr. Yesha was offered and accepted the directorship of the Center for Applied Information Technology (CAIT) at NIST in charge of the procurement design for electronic commerce systems across all federal agencies. She was only 31 years old.At that time, Dr. Yesha was still an assistant professor, with a road to tenure. Her intent was to return to secure her tenure.I was just offered this position in the federal government with the highest technical grade. I wanted to go on leave to do this. It was unusual to leave while you were on tenure track. However, I was adamant I’d get tenure and I promised to bring back more prestige and new opportunities to the university.Dr. Yesha was granted leave, and assumed her role as the director of CAIT, designing architecture for all the federal agencies to procure products and services through e-commerce.Dr. Yesha’s meaningful contribution to electronic commerce at a time when it was transformative put her in a position of influence. She represented the U.S. at the G7 Summit, leading the development of resources and co-authored books on Electronic Commerce to train the next generation of scientists, and to determine the impacts on policy, governance, and compliance. Dr. Yesha received funding from the European Union and NSF to build a Master of Science in Electronic Commerce Program across Europe. The electronic commerce courses were run online through IBM, Rutgers, Dalhousie, Toronto and 12 business schools in Europe, and became an important component of the electronic commerce curriculums during the internet boom, 1997-2001. She simultaneously led the development of programs to re-educate the American workforce and train K-12 teachers in the use of internet technology. At this time Dr. Yesha was 32 and received early tenure at UMBC.Sometime later, Yelena was offered and accepted the directorship of the NASA Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences (CESDIS):The candidates I competed with were all men – and were much more well known at the time. I was gaining increased prominence for my work at NIST and NASA, however my contenders were already shining stars. I was eventually selected for the position and this was, by far, my most demanding role, and the male-dominated environment at NASA during this time made it even more challenging. At the center, I inherited approximately 28 active projects, and managed a large number of Ph.D. level scientists including astrophysicists. We were equipped with the fourth most powerful supercomputer in the world, attached to the largest unclassified data archive in the world.In 5 years at NASA, Dr. Yesha was able to build successes overseeing:Jacob Slonim was the founder of the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) at IBM Toronto Lab. He learned of Dr. Yesha’s work on electronic commerce and invited her to come to IBM, coaxing her to participate in research on electronic commerce and database. Dr. Yesha began to make her mark at IBM by participating in the development of DB2, a scalable relational database system able to run on a number of authoritative operating systems like Linux, Windows, etc. Dr. Yesha’s influence prompted commercial adoption by NASA. She also contributed to other notable projects like Eclipse, an IT integrated development environment (IDE), which is now the most widely used Java IDE; In 2000 Dr. Yesha co-edited (with Weidong Kou) the very first IBM Press book, “Electronic Commerce Technology Trends: Challenges and Opportunities”.The Multicore revolution began in 2007. Rod Adkins, Senior Vice President of IBM at the time, gave UMBC the mandate of benchmarking and evangelizing the technology, with Dr. Yesha as the Principal Investigator. By 2009, through UMBC, Dr. Yesha and Dr. Milt Halem together founded the National Science Foundation Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR), a 15-year award that promoted a consortium including universities, industry, and government to work on programs of national significance that have commercial value.Some of CHMPR accomplishments Dr. Yesha oversaw include:Dr. Yesha recounts her passion when she first came to Canada: using information technology to address major healthcare challenges.I had a significant role in designing the operating room of the future, building surgical simulations to train the next generation of surgeons. Funding that I received from several agencies enabled me to do this work. This is what I wanted to do all my life... Now I can.Dr. Yesha, not one to limit her opportunities, was asked by a colleague to bridge the gap between computer science and medical research in a way that hadn’t yet been achieved. In 2004, Dr. Yesha began working on personalized medicine to determine new ways the clinical decision support systems could enable more patient-centric solutions. Using machine learning, Dr. Yesha and her collaborators were able to tease out specific features pertinent to individual diseases while mitigating any confusion of interactions among several diseases, and, in the process, improve the accuracy of diagnosis.Once this was completed, the team focused on relevant treatment for patient-specific indications. By combining the patient’s clinical records and diagnosis with his/her genomic information, the team used machine learning to bring an internet feed directly to the physician, which included search results for the most recent and relevant clinical findings and articles from publications in medical journals and CAS, etc.,The importance of AI for medical innovation is on the rise… We started working on the ability to combine clinical and genetic records.  By combining computer science and medicine, we will be able to build a clinical decision support system that produces a holistic view of the patient, fusing clinical and genetic information and using the power of real-time computing to empower the physician at the point of care… This would free up the doctor to focus on quality patient care from better information.Dr. Yesha realized what the industry wanted:Big Data is too broad a term. So I proposed the development of a new center to capture more actionable knowledge from Big Data in real time: the Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA). The current Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research is now in year 10. I decided to phase it out it and start CARTA.In early 2018, CARTA competed for and won a 15-year NSF funding. Its vision is to enable real-time analytics leveraged by smart data. The real value to the industry will be the “automated ingestion and simultaneous analytics” of Big Datasets, in particular for cyberspace, healthcare, IoT and self-learning. Dr. Yelena’s belief is that the future society will be enabled by 3 technologies:Three transformative technologies will revolutionize the way we use, teach, consume and enable computing capabilities: 1) Quantum Computing 2) AI and 3) Blockchain. These technologies are here to stay and will enable significant changes to society. Quantum computing as a platform will change the way developers program computers, while undoubtedly dramatically improving performance. This will require new training for programmers and effective users of the platform. For industry, the leap forward will be evident. As well, AI, at a mass market level, will make its biggest impact in robotics. Blockchain will have an influence in reforming many aspects of computing. And the prime ROI will be achieved in the supply chain, Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity. Most blockchain solutions will require customization based on domain expertise. This gap has motivated us to come up with a unique solution.Spearheading new technologies through commercialization is a natural passage that Dr. Yesha has undertaken with vigor. In June 2018, Dr. Yesha launched her new startup called SofThread, commercializing a permissioned blockchain technology with the purpose of solving some of its challenges today.There is enormous demand for blockchain tech for the supply chain.

Stick Around, Because We’re About to Find out","Barack Obama predicted it: Universal basic income (UBI) is under debate. In a UBI system, all citizens are given a flat income regardless of their employment situation — essentially, they will receive money just for being born. The concept is being explored as a potential solution to the problems that will soon arise from artificial intelligence (AI) and job automation.Though simple in concept, the idea has sparked lively debate.Proponents of UBI see it benefitting society on a number of levels. In February, Nobel laureate Sir Christopher Pissarides made his argument at the World Economic Forum:[We] need to develop a new system of redistributions, new policies that will redistribute inevitably from those that the market would have rewarded in favor of those that the market would have left behind. Now, having a universal minimum income is one of those ways, in fact, it is one I am very much in favor of, as long as we know how to apply it without taking away incentive to work at the lower end of the market.Y Combinator president Sam Altman is also in favor of UBI, and his company plans to launch a pilot run in Oakland. Altman explains:[We] think of basic income as providing a floor, and we believe people should be able to work and earn as much as they want. We hope a minimum level of economic security will give people the freedom to pursue further education or training, find or create a better job, and plan for the future.The sentiment is echoed by fellow tech executive Elon Musk, who thinks that there’s a good chance we’ll end up with UBI, and Arvind Subramanian, India’s top economist, who has said, “[The] safety net provided by the government should be quite wide, and that is why this [basic income] has some merit.”The jobless folk can be supported using UBI, and the world won’t be shaken so much by AI and automation. Perfect, right? Not according to those opposed to UBI.“If you pay people to do nothing, they will do nothing,” Charles Wyplosz, economics professor at the Geneva Graduate Institute, told The Guardian after Switzerland voters rejected a UBI project earlier this year. Luzi Stamm, a member of the Swiss parliament, warned that a UBI system would have wreaked havoc on the country’s immigration: “If you would offer every individual a Swiss amount of money, you would have billions of people who would try to move into Switzerland.”Meanwhile, Robert Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, warned that implementing a UBI would mean taking money away from the people who really need it, those at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. His logic is hard to dispute. If you give any money to those at the top, those at the bottom are bound to get less.Regardless of which side of the debate you land on, at the end of the day, data weighs more than opinions. Some data is available on UBI — one study even shows how it can improve your health and not just your finances — but implementing and analyzing a modern pilot UBI program would be the best way to determine if it is the appropriate solution to modern problems.2017 is poised to be the year we do just that as various governments and institutions across the globe are ready to give UBI a shot. Plans to implement programs by early next year are in place in Canada, Finland, and Uganda. Those trial runs are very likely to tip the scales in this debate one way or the other. After that, it’ll be a matter of either refining UBI to best meet the demands of modern life or looking for an entirely new solution to the problems caused by automation and AI.",1,5,Neutral,Against,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Against', 'Neutral']","Is Universal Basic Income a Good Idea?

57,Penny - Keep It,Should the Penny Stay in Circulation?,1s57q5r,http://www.triplepundit.com/story/2016/why-do-we-still-bother-penny/26436,Why Do We Still Bother with the Penny?,"They say, “a penny for your thoughts,” but most of us can’t be bothered to even think for that low of a price. The same goes for bending over to pick one up from the ground: Even a former director of the U.S. Mint advises not to waste your time as “you’re getting paid less than minimum wage for your trouble.”It makes little economic sense to mint pennies. In recent years, the cost to mint a single penny, which are made almost entirely with zinc, has varied from its current 1.4 cents to 2.4 cents five years ago; the collapse in global commodities prices is largely behind its recent decrease in price.It also costs far more to make a nickel than its actual worth, but unlike pennies, nickels stay in circulation for years. Most of us find pennies annoying, so they sit in a jar somewhere, out of circulation. Try getting rid of them, like I do when I buy a few things at the supermarket across the corner and watch the dirty looks pile on, as if I were holding up the checkout line by writing an old-fashioned check. Nevertheless, retailers need them to make change, which in turn leads banks to request more pennies, so the U.S. Mint keeps churning them out — at a cost of $144 million in 2014, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.So, despite the fact that more transactions are processed electronically — 75 percent, reports CNBC — pennies are still accumulating in our mason jars, old ashtrays and between sofa cushions. Much of this is because of the phantom organization Americans for Common Cents (ACC), which makes the claim that pennies have the support of the majority of Americans — as in, yes, the same ones who hoard them because they don’t know what to do with them.Claiming that pennies are critical to everything from memorizing Abraham Lincoln to raising funds for leukemia patients, ACC insists that 68 percent of us want the penny, according to a poll conducted, rather conveniently, by the ACC. The organization's mailing address alone is telling: K Street in Washington, D.C., ground zero for American lobbying organizations.The Center for Public Integrity has been on the ACC’s case, and is calling the organization and its public-relations shills out. The ACC's executive director, Mark Weller, has long represented Jardin Zinc Products, a company that has provided many coin blanks to the U.S. Mint. Among his many shrill statements about this one-cent piece, Weller has testified that “working families benefit from the penny.”Opponents are quick to point out that the elimination of the penny will spur merchants to raise prices by rounding up. But that is an absurd argument considering that, again, most transactions are done electronically. While President Barack Obama has mused publicly that something needs to be done for the penny, as it is a metaphor for how government can be dysfunctional, plenty of organizations have responded that keeping the penny is in the best financial interests of Weller and his client.Most likely the penny will stick around for a while. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has mused about eliminating the one-cent piece, but now the Treasury is far more occupied redesigning paper currency that will cheer some but still leave many citizens unsatisfied. And as the Huffington Post points out, the penny is not a money-loser for the U.S. Mint itself, as coins minted for special collections more than offset the losses from making pennies (which is like a business saying, 'We’re losing money making land line phones, but, hey we’re making bank on smartphones').So, the fact that pennies go largely unused should be enough of an excuse to stop minting them, but look for well-connected interests to get their way. After all, any suggestion that the U.S. shift to dollar coins and phase out the $1 note, which is commonplace in most industrialized countries, has also come with a “sky will fall” response.Image credit: Reza/FlickrLeon Kaye, Executive Editor, has written for Triple Pundit since 2010.

Among his many shrill statements about this one-cent piece, Weller has testified that “working families benefit from the penny.”Opponents are quick to point out that the elimination of the penny will spur merchants to raise prices by rounding up. But that is an absurd argument considering that, again, most transactions are done electronically. While President Barack Obama has mused publicly that something needs to be done for the penny, as it is a metaphor for how government can be dysfunctional, plenty of organizations have responded that keeping the penny is in the best financial interests of Weller and his client.Most likely the penny will stick around for a while. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has mused about eliminating the one-cent piece, but now the Treasury is far more occupied redesigning paper currency that will cheer some but still leave many citizens unsatisfied. And as the Huffington Post points out, the penny is not a money-loser for the U.S. Mint itself, as coins minted for special collections more than offset the losses from making pennies (which is like a business saying, 'We’re losing money making land line phones, but, hey we’re making bank on smartphones').So, the fact that pennies go largely unused should be enough of an excuse to stop minting them, but look for well-connected interests to get their way. After all, any suggestion that the U.S. shift to dollar coins and phase out the $1 note, which is commonplace in most industrialized countries, has also come with a “sky will fall” response.Image credit: Reza/FlickrLeon Kaye, Executive Editor, has written for Triple Pundit since 2010.

20,Banned Books,Should Parents or Other Adults Be Able to Ban Books from Schools and Libraries?,1s20q1r,https://www.centralmaine.com/2019/02/20/liz-soares-the-problem-with-censorship-is-that-it-knows-no-bounds/,Liz Soares: The problem with censorship is that it knows no bounds - CentralMaine.com,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers While freedom isn’t always comfortable, it’s always worth protecting, writes Liz Soares. The American Library Association promotes Banned Books Week every October. I’m a school librarian, and last fall I created a presentation and an activity for middle and high school students to explore the issue of censorship.The library staff put a variety of books on the library tables, and students — in small groups — examined them. They identified the books they thought had been challenged in some way, and then reported back to the rest of the class.But we had been sneaky. At some time, all of the books on the tables had been denounced as obscene, violent, unpatriotic or one of dozens of other forms of condemnation.That’s the problem with censorship. It knows no bounds.The Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee of the Maine Legislature recently quashed a proposed censorship bill. As the ACLU of Maine described it, the bill “would ban ‘obscene’ books from Maine public schools by removing the exception that allows the use of ‘obscene’ materials for educational purposes in public schools.” In its original form, the proposal would have allowed teachers and school administrators to be charged with a felony if they exposed students to violent or sexually explicit literature, art or films.Note the quotation marks. Obscenity is a fluid concept. It’s a matter of opinion. It is defined in the eye of the beholder. As Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously wrote in an obscenity ruling in 1964, “I know it when I see it, and the motion picture in this case is not that.”In my presentation to the students, I showed a YouTube video of author and illustrator Dav Pilkey. He starts by saying his “Captain Underpants” series was the “most complained about book” in 2012 and 2013. The target audience for this series is 8- to 10-year-olds. What’s the fuss over “Captain Underpants”? Some adults don’t like toilet humor. Or they think the books encourage children to be disobedient. One of the books mentions that one of the protagonists is gay.Pilkey responds to attempted censorship with humor, but spot-on common sense: “Everybody doesn’t always like the same things.” He draws censorious adult cartoon characters who say things like, “I don’t want children to read this book.” By making what Pilkey calls “a simple change” to “I don’t want my children to read this book,” the character is free to make his own choice, without affecting the rights of others to make theirs.Too many people want to make this issue complicated. More than 300 book challenges were reported to the ALA in 2017, but there probably were many more. A challenge occurs when somebody wants a library, school or bookstore to remove a book from its shelves.Most libraries have policies to deal with challenges. Several stakeholders (librarians, teachers, parents, administrators, community members) read the book and then meet to decide whether it should stay or go. Patrons have a voice, but not a right to have a book removed simply because they don’t like it.The Wikipedia article on the most commonly challenged books in the U.S. lists too many to count — more than 200. Ernest Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls” has been decried for its “pro-Communist views.” Interestingly, it was an important book to the late Republican Sen. John McCain, a true American hero.This is how nonsensical attempts at censorship can be. Would the censors have preferred that Hemingway took the side of the fascists in the Spanish Civil War?The book “George,” by Alex Geno, has been criticized for including a transgender child as a character. The Harry Potter series features witchcraft and magic. Shel Silverstein’s poetry anthology, “A Light in the Attic,” is violent and encourages disobedience. My favorite: The Bible should be yanked from shelves because it has “a religious viewpoint”!I read “Go Ask Alice” as a teenager and was totally shocked by it. But it ensured that I’d never run away from home. “In Cold Blood,” by Truman Capote, is violent. It’s the story of four brutal murders and their aftermath. Reading it as a teen, I worried that I’d be murdered in my sleep. I wasn’t, and it remains one of my favorite books to this day.I would never question the right of parents to control what their children read or view. But no one has the right to impose their personal beliefs about what is right and what is wrong on others.Children sometimes do read and see things that disturb or confuse them. When they do, parents can step in, to discuss and explain. And to teach them that, while freedom isn’t always comfortable, it’s always worth protecting.

17,Student Loan Debt,Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy?,1s17q2r,https://abovethelaw.com/2016/01/the-tetzlaff-aftermath-discharging-student-loans-in-bankruptcy-might-be-easier-than-we-thought/,The Tetzlaff Aftermath: Discharging Student Loans In Bankruptcy Might Be Easier Than We Thought | Above the Law,"the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the Tetzlaff case. Many will interpret this decision as a nod to the status quo’s high difficulty in discharging student loans in bankruptcy. While I am disappointed with the high court’s decision not to decide, I found that all may not be lost. As I was doing research for my last two articles (here and here), I came across some useful findings which I will share with you today. Specifically, discharging student loan debts through bankruptcy may not be as difficult as it appears to be.A few years ago, Elie Mystal argued that the hopeless and financially destitute with large student loan debt should seriously consider filing bankruptcy. He cites to a study showing that 40% of filers received some form of discharge from the bankruptcy court. That study was conducted by Jason Iuliano, a Harvard Law graduate and a Ph. D. candidate at Princeton.Iuliano’s study is worth reading. He reviewed every bankruptcy case involving student loans in 2007. He found that of the 169,774 student loan debtors filing bankruptcy, only 213 filed adversary proceedings, a necessary step to discharge student loans. And of that 213, 51 received full discharges, 30 received partial discharges and 25 received an administrative remedy. In other words, 0.1% of bankruptcy filers even tried to discharge their student loans. And of those who tried, 50% of them received some kind of relief from the court and 25% received a full discharge of their student loans.Why do so few people attempt to discharge their student loans when they have already started bankruptcy proceedings? Iuliano believes that many eligible people do not try because they do not think they will succeed. This belief comes from many in the media stating that student loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy. Some have even erroneously stated that student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy under any circumstances.Of course, people love to read about judges denying bankruptcy relief to blind, triple-amputee senior citizens with pancreatic cancer because they didn’t buy the cheaper, generic drugs from Canada. But many writers and experts stress the difficulty of discharging student loan debts in bankruptcy in order to encourage students to borrow as little as possible and to show the consequences of borrowing excessively.Some have even talked to bankruptcy attorneys who declined their case. I suspect that many of these attorneys stick with simple Chapter 7 and 13 cases and do not take adversarial cases. And those who do charge large up-front fees due to the amount of work involved and the lenders’ strong likelihood of appealing a bad decision.Promoted Sponsored Content Beyond the Trash Bin: Proper Disposal of Electronic Data Beyond the Trash Bin: Proper Disposal of Electronic Data Above the Law readers are offered 1 free CLE course each month, thanks to Lawline.

LAWLINE All of this appears to have the unintended consequence of dissuading potentially eligible people from even trying to discharge their loans.However, there are stories of people who were able to successfully discharge their student loans, although with great difficulty. In In re Walker, in an eloquently written opinion, the court found that the debtor established undue hardship using the totality of the circumstances test because she was able to prove that the student loan payments would prevent her from adequately providing for her children. This case was particularly interesting because the lenders argued that the debtor should not be granted a discharge because she had too many children.Perhaps those with large student loan debts should be encouraged to seriously consider filing bankruptcy. Does this mean that one should file hoping to be one of the 50% that get partial discharge or the 25% that get full discharge? Of course not. But there are steps people can take to maximize their chances of negotiating down their debt through bankruptcy or otherwise.First, try to hire an attorney, but don’t be afraid to negotiate or go to bankruptcy court alone if you have to. Iuliano states that debtors not represented by an attorney are just as successful as those who are represented by an attorney. However, hiring a competent attorney (even on a limited-scope basis) can make the process quicker and easier.Promoted Sponsored Content Are You Interested In The Field Of Litigation Finance?

You may have to trade in your luxury car for a used Toyota Corolla. If the thought of downgrading your lifestyle bothers you, then bankruptcy may not be for you.Third, try to negotiate with the lender before filing bankruptcy. The Department of Education recently issued guidance as to when student loan servicers should not contest a debtor’s claim of undue hardship in bankruptcy. However, the letter also states that the servicers’ decisions are subject to audit and not following the guidelines will result in denial of claim payments to the servicer. So it is safe to say that servicers will contest any claim of undue hardship except for the most extreme.Finally, if you decide to file bankruptcy, expect a long, invasive, and contentious fight. You will be questioned about every purchase you made. You will be criticized not only for lavish spending but also for things normal people do, like saving for retirement, having cable TV, and shopping at Macy’s instead of Walmart. You may have to argue before an unsympathetic judge. Finally, if a bankruptcy judge grants an undue hardship discharge, expect multiple appeals.In the end, bankruptcy is one of several options a debtor has to resolve their debts.

39,Cuba Embargo,Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?,1s39q4r,http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2009-03-19/article/32486,The United States and Cuba After Fidel. Category: Public Comment from The Berkeley Daily Planet,"Recently Raúl Casto reshuffled Cuba’s government, replacing or moving 12 cabinet members a year after assuming the presidency from his brother Fidel. Supposedly, Fidel approved the reshuffle. It would seem that Raúl is now the undisputed Cuban leader, although the shadow of Fidel will linger over Cuba long after his demise. Who will succeed the 77-year old Raúl? And will the U.S. keep its hands off?  The 82-year old Fidel is reportedly in very poor health. He hasn’t written a newspaper column since December 15 and he failed to appear live or on television on Jan. 1 to mark Cuba’s 50 years of communism.   I have mixed feelings about Fidel’s legacy. Many Cubans would probably agree, albeit covertly, that Fidel was a welcome guest for dinner, but overstayed his welcome. The revolutionary became a dictator for life. It might have been different. In April 1959, shortly after taking power, Fidel traveled to the U.S. The Eisenhower administration could have embraced Fidel, offering him economic assistance. But remember this was during the Cold War and Castro smacked of socialism/communism. Eisenhower snubbed him. He met instead with Vice President Nixon for a few hours. No economic assistance was offered. The next year Castro turned to Russia for economic assistance and the rest is history.  Under Raúl’s leadership, we may see a more pragmatic, less doctrinaire Cuba. With new Cuban leadership and with a Barack Obama presidency, perhaps it is time to take a fresh look at the 46-year old economic, trade, and financial sanctions the U.S. imposed on Cuba following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles. The rest of the world wants the embargo ended as seen by the October 2008, UN General Assembly overwhelming vote—for the 17th year in a row—in favor of lifting the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. Some 185 of the assembly’s 192 members approved a resolution, which reiterated a “call upon all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures (such as those in the U.S. embargo) in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law.” The U.S., Israel and Palau voted against the resolution, while Micronesia and the Marshall Islands abstained.  A modest beginning is passage of the “Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act”—included in the $410 billion omnibus spending bill recently signed by President Obama—which lifted the Cuba travel restrictions enacted five years ago by former President George W. Bush. This means Cuban-Americans can now visit their relatives on the island once a year for as long as they like. The Act does not change other existing restrictions, but prohibits spending on enforcement.  My wife and I traveled “legally” to Cuba in November 2003 on one of the last so-called “People-to-People” tours, visiting Havana, Viñales, and Santiago de Cuba. Shortly thereafter, the U.S. Treasury Department stopped issuing “people-to people” licenses. As the remaining licenses expired — most in November or December 2003— so did those trips. Hopefully, sometime soon, my wife and I will again be able to visit Cuba legally.  Finally, Obama signed executive orders directing the CIA to shut down the Guantánamo Bay detention camp within a year. After Guantánamo is closed why not give Guantánamo Bay back to Cuba, its rightful owners. Why should we continue to have a base in Cuba? The U.S. occupation of Guantánamo dates back to the passage of the Platt amendment to a U.S. Army Appropriations Bill of 1901, which gave the U.S. the right to intervene militarily in Cuban affairs whenever the U.S. decided such intervention was warranted. Cubans were given the choice of accepting the Platt Amendment or remaining under U.S. military occupation indefinitely. The U.S. has intervened militarily in Cuban affairs at least three times. U.S. intervention endowed Cuba with a series of weak, corrupt, dependent governments until the triumph of the Cuban revolution in 1959. In 1903, the U.S. used it to obtain a perpetual lease of Guantánamo Bay, a blatant example of U.S. gunboat diplomacy.

The United States and Cuba After Fidel. Category: Public Comment from The Berkeley Daily Planet Recently Raúl Casto reshuffled Cuba’s government, replacing or moving 12 cabinet members a year after assuming the presidency from his brother Fidel. Supposedly, Fidel approved the reshuffle. It would seem that Raúl is now the undisputed Cuban leader, although the shadow of Fidel will linger over Cuba long after his demise. Who will succeed the 77-year old Raúl? And will the U.S. keep its hands off?  The 82-year old Fidel is reportedly in very poor health. He hasn’t written a newspaper column since December 15 and he failed to appear live or on television on Jan. 1 to mark Cuba’s 50 years of communism.   I have mixed feelings about Fidel’s legacy. Many Cubans would probably agree, albeit covertly, that Fidel was a welcome guest for dinner, but overstayed his welcome. The revolutionary became a dictator for life. It might have been different. In April 1959, shortly after taking power, Fidel traveled to the U.S. The Eisenhower administration could have embraced Fidel, offering him economic assistance. But remember this was during the Cold War and Castro smacked of socialism/communism. Eisenhower snubbed him. He met instead with Vice President Nixon for a few hours. No economic assistance was offered. The next year Castro turned to Russia for economic assistance and the rest is history.  Under Raúl’s leadership, we may see a more pragmatic, less doctrinaire Cuba. With new Cuban leadership and with a Barack Obama presidency, perhaps it is time to take a fresh look at the 46-year old economic, trade, and financial sanctions the U.S. imposed on Cuba following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed Cuban exiles.

21,Drinking Age - Lower It,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?,2s21q2r,https://www.michigandaily.com/section/columns/miles-stephenson-what-america-gets-right-and-wrong-about-our-drinking-attitudes,Miles Stephenson: Solve dangerous drinking | The Michigan Daily,"It’s a Friday night in Ann Arbor and the promise of the weekend has students flocking to Main Street bars and clubs to engage in the great American pastime of intoxication. But with an undergraduate population of more than 29,000, some of these revelers are bound to be underage. In line, Zach, aged 18, fumbles for something in his pocket when he reaches the bouncer. Thirty minutes later, Zach is at the bar ordering his fifth shot of tequila before stumbling home. This scenario is made possible by a simple invention: the fake ID. Couple this technology with a tendency for underage binge-drinking and you have a potentially dangerous cocktail for the social landscape of American college towns. As a freshman new to the social scene of Ann Arbor, I set off across campus to talk to students. First, I wanted to learn more about fake IDs and how they texture the experiences of students at the University of Michigan. Second, I wanted to examine the particularly American brand of binge-drinking that these fake IDs afford to underage drinkers and the alternative drinking cultures found around the world. I was convinced these trends were two symptoms of the same disease, and that by finding the heart of the issue, young Americans could begin to develop a culture with more safe and responsible drinking habits. The fake ID is an expanding American personality (touted in popular songs and joked about in blockbuster movies) with an entire underground economy. The Northwestern Business Review writes, “The quality of the product varies due to minute changes in the polyvinyl chloride, spectrophotometer matched ink and luminescent holograms. Up-front costs including the printer and templates can run up to $2000 alone.” I spoke to some students on campus to see if these popular anecdotes were consistent with their experiences. First, I interviewed a student who had just ordered their first fake ID ever: MILES: How did you get in contact with the maker? STUDENT 1: My friend asked me if I needed one and I said, ""Yes, I do."" MILES: How much did you pay? STUDENT 1: $80. I estimate there are about 30 people in my order, which makes it cheaper. MILES: Why are you getting it now? STUDENT 1: In high school, the local liquor store would sell us alcohol even if we didn't have a fake. In Ann Arbor, you need one to go out with friends to bars. MILES: Are you nervous about purchasing it and using it? STUDENT 1: Normally I would be, but the guy who I’m buying it from does them very routinely and I know people who have gotten fakes from him before. Using it, yeah … it seems kind of sketch. Next, I spoke to a student from the undergraduate class of 2020 who told me a story about purchasing a fake ID: ""When we were in high school, you couldn't get IDs online. You had to get them from people. We had a car to go get it and we texted this shady-ass dude all our personal info. It was $150 an ID. We brought $300 cash and met this dude at midnight in an abandoned warehouse parking lot near (San Francisco Bay Area). Dude rolls up in a black Suburban, pulls in behind us, blocks us in and gets out of the car with a pit bull."" After an initial frightening episode, the high schoolers gave him an envelope with money and drove home. Phony Tony, the maker of the IDs, remains a local legend in the Bay Area, but this story articulates the potentially dangerous situations students are involving themselves in to bypass 21+ American drinking laws. Finally, I spoke to not a supplier of fake IDs, but a liaison between customers and makers. This person characterized their position as “organizing orders (of fake IDs)” and said that they had about 10 customers in Ann Arbor at one point. Most of their fake IDs were modeled off of real East Coast IDs. So, what’s the solution to this potentially dangerous scheme? An article in the U.S. National Library of Medicine titled, “Will Increasing Alcohol Availability By Lowering the Minimum Legal Drinking Age Decrease Drinking and Related Consequences Among Youths?” questions the theory that drinking laws should be made more lenient to cultivate responsible drinking culture. Proponents of this idea argue that the 21-and-over drinking age stigmatizes alcohol consumption to such a degree that young Americans are learning to drink in unsupervised spaces and that more permissive legislation would allow these underage drinkers to learn from more responsible, societally-normalized sources. After all, Europe has a safer drinking culture with its younger age drinking laws, right? In the popular imagination, French 12-year-olds are sipping wine with their parents at dinner and are learning to drink responsibly — it’s America that’s obsessed with taking shots and “blacking out.” This, however, is not the case. “If you look at the data, there's no evidence to support the idea that Europe, in general, has a safer drinking culture than the US … European teens ages 15 to 19 tend to report greater levels of binge drinking than American teens,” writes German Lopez of Vox. When looking at the percent of 15 and 16-year-olds who report being drunk in the last month, Denmark, the U.K. and Austria are the most severe with 49, 33 and 31 percent respectively. The U.S. by contrast, is on par with Latvia at 18 percent. Furthermore, nearly all available evidence suggests that stricter alcohol policies can reduce deaths, and another article by the U.S. National Library of Medicine titled “Case closed: research evidence on the positive public health impact of the age 21 minimum legal drinking age in the United States” puts this misconception to rest. So it seems that a 21-and-over drinking age is safer, but maybe it’s less about the actual age and more about the cultural attitudes and behaviors toward drinking. There’s an unspoken acceptance that underage drinking will happen, especially in colleges, and yet the legal angle doesn’t reflect this. “Drinking alcohol has become a rite of passage for some young people in this country, and many students come to college having learned to drink during their high school years,” says the University Health Service. And yet, besides special cases of medical amnesty, the looming threat of receiving a Minor in Possession violation, which entails a $250 fine to the 15th District Court, often disincentivizes underage drinkers to seek help from authorities. Here, perhaps, is where the opportunity to learn from international practices truly lies. Canadian universities have begun to implement “drunk tanks,” or spaces for intoxicated underage drinkers to recover safely and without the threat of punishment. The University of Guelph’s campus alcohol recovery room and the University of Calgary’s post-alcohol support space solve the stigma issue and potentially save lives. CARR is a “six-bed space equipped with buckets that opened last year inside a campus residence building,” while PASS is “staffed by both volunteers and a registered nurse.” A coupling of America’s safer, 21-and-over drinking laws and Canada’s more lenient enforcement could decrease avoidable underage drinking accidents and save the lives of young college students. As for the prevalence of fake IDs, it’s likely that an underground industry like this will continue to thrive, especially as new technology develops that further blurs the line between real and fake for alcohol-serving establishments. And their readiness proves dangerous, as it enables students to more easily engage in binge drinking. If something’s to be done, it’s to ensure young Americans are protected by the safest laws and they have the proper resources to reach out when someone pushes them too far.",2,2,Against,Against,Against,0,Against,"['Against', 'Against', 'Against']","Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?

For about five hours, in the ceremonial courtroom of the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse, in front of D.C. Circuit Judges Millett, Williams, and Wilkins, attorneys for Petitioners, for the FCC, and for intervenors on both sides got a grilling in a court that has become a regular forum for disputes over the status of broadband and the lawfulness of net neutrality rules.The sheer length of the arguments presented on Friday -- where each individual arguing attorney was given at least double their allotted time to make their arguments and respond to voluminous questioning -- shows that this is not an open-and-shut case. There are many complex legal and factual arguments and claims to deal with. Both sides got hard questions, but on balance it appears that the FCC bore the brunt of skeptical questioning from the bench, and despite Judge William's occasional softballs, it appeared unable to cope with a number of very tough but basic questions from Judge Millett in particular.Petitioners and intervenors supporting them made many arguments as to why the FCC’s action was unlawful, of course, and those who are truly interested in the case should read the briefs, and the transcript of the argument when it is available. To highlight some of them:As for the FCC's arguments, it hoped to start and end with the Supreme Court precedent in Brand X. Under Brand X, under some circumstances and with the right factual findings, the FCC can classify broadband as an information service. No one disputes this much. But the Petitioners’ lead argument explained how the FCC here departed from, rather than followed, Brand X, in effect deleting Title II and the definition of telecommunications out of the statute. Fortunately for Petitioners, questions regarding the FCC’s adherence to Brand X came from the bench as well. Judge Millett in particular pushed back on the FCC, noting that Brand X dealt with the ambiguity of the word ""offer,"" while the FCC's new argument -- one designed to make it so that broadband must be considered an information service -- centers on the word “capability.” The FCC's current theory is that because broadband offers the capability of accessing information services (websites, etc.), it is itself an information service. But as Judge Millett noted, this seems to make it so that there cannot be any telecommunications services at all, since any telecommunications service is capable of accessing an information service. Under her questioning, FCC General Counsel Thomas Johnson failed to distinguish broadband from something that was concededly a telecommunications service, telephony. His various attempts simply lacked any grounding in the statute or the logic of the FCC's reasoning.Judge Millett’s questioning also revealed another absurdity in the FCC's position. If simply providing a communications conduit constitutes a “capability” under the information services definition, and since information services, again under the definition, are offered “via telecommunications,” the FCC's current statutory construction seems to amount to defining an information service as “telecommunications ... offered via telecommunications.” Although agencies have wide latitude to adopt readings of statutes that they prefer, those interpretations must be reasonable, and must not be absurd or contradictory. Further, under the Administrative Procedure Act, agencies are required to grapple with the consequences of their interpretations. Failing to meaningfully distinguish broadband from telephone service could well be held by the court to be a failure of reasoned decision-making.Oral argument might be the most visible part of an appellate case, but it’s not necessarily the most important. Both sides have laid out their arguments with more precision and detail in the actual briefs, and as the judges (and their clerks) dig into this over the next few weeks and months they will undoubtedly clarify their thinking. It is not surprising that Judge Williams was sympathetic to the FCC here, as he dissented from past decisions upholding net neutrality and the classification of broadband as telecommunications, and appears convinced of the policy merits of the FCC's position -- though even he appeared receptive to certain technical and procedural arguments put forth on the other side. Judge Millett put forth a surprising barrage of tough questions to the FCC, and though less vocal, Judge Wilkins also appeared skeptical of the breadth of the FCC's actions.On balance, I come away from the argument fairly confident of a victory for Petitioners, though as to how sweeping of a victory, and on what precise grounds, it is as difficult as ever to say.Image credit: VimeoJoin us on 6/5 at 5:30pm for a viewing of the new film “When Rules Don’t Apply” - a documentary detailing the 2013… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…Join us on 6/5 at 5:30pm for a viewing of the new film “When Rules Don’t Apply” - a documentary detailing the 2013… twitter.com/i/web/status/1…Tell Congress to Fix the DMCA Public Knowledge promotes freedom of expression, an open internet, and access to affordable communications tools and creative works.

Bangladeshi authorities have blocked almost 20,000 websites as part of an anti-pornography ""war"", a minister said on Tuesday.Internet providers in the conservative Muslim-majority nation took down pornography and gambling websites in the past week under orders from the telecommunications regulator.""I want to create a safe and secure internet for all Bangladeshis, including children.

In an effort to attract more teachers, the U.S. Department of Education established the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant in 2008.The TEACH grant is a federal grant that can be worth up to $4,000 per year for qualified students. Students must agree to teach for four years at a public school that serves low-income families. There are some other stipulations as well, such as taking required coursework and making sure the college participates in the program.If the requirements for the grant are not fulfilled, the terms state that it will be converted to an unsubsidized Stafford loan, meaning students who thought they were getting money that would cover tuition will now owe the amount in full on top of accrued interest.Thousands of teachers have reportedly had their grants taken away and converted to student loans, sometimes for minor errors in paperwork, even though they were on track to meeting the program's teaching requirements.Because of this, the Department of Education has updated its terms as of Jan. 31, 2019, and is offering teachers a chance to apply for reconsideration of their loans.Read: Here's what teachers with student loans from the TEACH grant need to know to apply for reconsideration:Teachers can request reconsideration if they met or are on track to meet the grant requirements. In order to meet the requirements, a participant must serve as a full-time teacher for a total of at least four academic years within eight years after finishing – or leaving – the eligible program for which the TEACH grant funds were received.Teaching must be done at a school or educational service agency that serves low-income students and must be in a high-need field. The Department of Education defines high-need fields as bilingual education and English language acquisition, foreign language, mathematics, reading specialist, science, special education and any other field included in the annual Teacher Shortage Area Nationwide Listing (Nationwide List). Teachers who had their grants converted to loans because they did not submit documentation of their progress toward completing the service obligation are eligible to request reconsideration.Read: Those who are eligible to request TEACH grant reconsideration will be notified by email. The Department of Education will email individuals who are eligible to request reconsideration the week of Feb. 4, 2019. If you have proof that you completed your required four years of qualifying teaching within eight years or are on track to do so, your loans may qualify.If you do not receive an email notification but still feel you are eligible for reconsideration, contact ED's TEACH grant servicer, FedLoan Servicing, by phone at 855-499-9543 between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern time, Monday-Friday. Be ready to answer questions and provide more information as needed for them to determine your eligibility status. If you are unable to call, you may email FedLoan Serving at TEACHgrantconversions@myfedloan.org. Be sure to include your request for reconsideration and a phone number where they can reach you for more information. Annual certifications will now be due Oct. 31. As part of the TEACH grant program, each year participants are expected to provide FedLoan Servicing with documentation showing completion of a full school year of qualifying teaching service, or a certification of the intention to satisfy the service obligation.Read: While the annual certification date previously varied among grant recipients, the Department of Education has now designated Oct. 31 as the standardized deadline for teachers to submit this annual certification. Beginning in 2019, each year at the beginning of October, FedLoan Servicing will notify grant participants on how to submit their documentation of progress.If a teacher does not submit documentation by Oct. 31, all TEACH grants will be converted to direct unsubsidized loans.

In an effort to attract more teachers, the U.S. Department of Education established the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant in 2008.The TEACH grant is a federal grant that can be worth up to $4,000 per year for qualified students. Students must agree to teach for four years at a public school that serves low-income families. There are some other stipulations as well, such as taking required coursework and making sure the college participates in the program.If the requirements for the grant are not fulfilled, the terms state that it will be converted to an unsubsidized Stafford loan, meaning students who thought they were getting money that would cover tuition will now owe the amount in full on top of accrued interest.Thousands of teachers have reportedly had their grants taken away and converted to student loans, sometimes for minor errors in paperwork, even though they were on track to meeting the program's teaching requirements.Because of this, the Department of Education has updated its terms as of Jan. 31, 2019, and is offering teachers a chance to apply for reconsideration of their loans.Read: Here's what teachers with student loans from the TEACH grant need to know to apply for reconsideration:Teachers can request reconsideration if they met or are on track to meet the grant requirements. In order to meet the requirements, a participant must serve as a full-time teacher for a total of at least four academic years within eight years after finishing – or leaving – the eligible program for which the TEACH grant funds were received.Teaching must be done at a school or educational service agency that serves low-income students and must be in a high-need field. The Department of Education defines high-need fields as bilingual education and English language acquisition, foreign language, mathematics, reading specialist, science, special education and any other field included in the annual Teacher Shortage Area Nationwide Listing (Nationwide List). Teachers who had their grants converted to loans because they did not submit documentation of their progress toward completing the service obligation are eligible to request reconsideration.Read: Those who are eligible to request TEACH grant reconsideration will be notified by email. The Department of Education will email individuals who are eligible to request reconsideration the week of Feb. 4, 2019. If you have proof that you completed your required four years of qualifying teaching within eight years or are on track to do so, your loans may qualify.If you do not receive an email notification but still feel you are eligible for reconsideration, contact ED's TEACH grant servicer, FedLoan Servicing, by phone at 855-499-9543 between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern time, Monday-Friday. Be ready to answer questions and provide more information as needed for them to determine your eligibility status. If you are unable to call, you may email FedLoan Serving at TEACHgrantconversions@myfedloan.org. Be sure to include your request for reconsideration and a phone number where they can reach you for more information. Annual certifications will now be due Oct. 31. As part of the TEACH grant program, each year participants are expected to provide FedLoan Servicing with documentation showing completion of a full school year of qualifying teaching service, or a certification of the intention to satisfy the service obligation.Read: While the annual certification date previously varied among grant recipients, the Department of Education has now designated Oct. 31 as the standardized deadline for teachers to submit this annual certification. Beginning in 2019, each year at the beginning of October, FedLoan Servicing will notify grant participants on how to submit their documentation of progress.If a teacher does not submit documentation by Oct. 31, all TEACH grants will be converted to direct unsubsidized loans. The borrower will then be required to repay these loans with interest charges from the date the TEACH grants were disbursed. The servicer will notify the participant if the grants are converted to loans.Keep in mind that this annual certification date is separate from the initial 120-day certification requirement. Teachers are still expected to confirm in writing within 120 days of the day of completion or withdrawal from the school where the TEACH grant was received if they are employed as a full-time teacher or not yet employed but intend to meet the requirements.Courtney Nagle, ContributorCourtney Nagle is the associate marketing manager for the National Foundation for Credit Counse...

16,Teacher Tenure,Should Teachers Get Tenure?,2s16q7r,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/02/19/striking-teachers-gather-chant-at-west-virginia-capitol-ahead-of-house-vote/,WV MetroNews House votes to table omnibus education bill indefinitely - WV MetroNews,"Share Article By Brad McElhinny in News | February 19, 2019 at 12:35PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. — The House of Delegates approved a motion that postponed an omnibus education bill indefinitely, essentially killing the bill.The motion to table the bill passed 53 to 45 with two absences. That elicited an eruption of cheers from teachers who gathered outside the House of Delegates.Debate over what to do with the bill lasted more than an hour.Delegate Mike Caputo, D-Marion, offered the motion to table it indefinitely.“The bill needs to die, and it needs to die today,” Caputo said.But first delegates had to decide what to do with a separate motion by Majority Leader Amy Summers, R-Taylor, to table the bill until 4 p.m. Delegates wound up voting down the Summers motion, 45-53-2.There are 59 Republicans in the House and 41 Democrats. Two Republicans, Moore Capito of Kanawha County and Larry Kump of Berkeley County, were absent today.A couple of Republican delegates spoke up with criticism of the bill.Delegate Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, objected to the constitutionality of the many aspects of law addressed by the bill. He also expressed concern about the estimated $200 million cost.Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a main advocate for the big education bill, expressed disappointment but said he would continue to fight for educational policy changes.“Unfortunately today the champions of the status quo won,” said Carmichael, R-Jackson. “But that will not stop progress. They’re on the wrong side of history.”The Republican-led Senate voted Monday to restore up to seven charter schools and 1,000 education savings accounts, which are for students leaving public school for private education.Carmichael said yesterday the House had indicated there were 52 votes to pass those changes.“They had a caucus and committed to 52 votes, and I said ‘OK, we’re going to run it,” Carmichael recounted.But somewhere, somehow that number changed.“We had an agreement. They had a commitment of 52 votes. If they hadn’t committed, we wouldn’t have run the amendment,” Carmichael said.“What I’ll say is one’s word is all you have in this building. So you need to honor your word.”Carmichael also addressed comments by Gov.

WV MetroNews House votes to table omnibus education bill indefinitely - WV MetroNews Share Article By Brad McElhinny in News | February 19, 2019 at 12:35PMCHARLESTON, W.Va. — The House of Delegates approved a motion that postponed an omnibus education bill indefinitely, essentially killing the bill.The motion to table the bill passed 53 to 45 with two absences. That elicited an eruption of cheers from teachers who gathered outside the House of Delegates.Debate over what to do with the bill lasted more than an hour.Delegate Mike Caputo, D-Marion, offered the motion to table it indefinitely.“The bill needs to die, and it needs to die today,” Caputo said.But first delegates had to decide what to do with a separate motion by Majority Leader Amy Summers, R-Taylor, to table the bill until 4 p.m. Delegates wound up voting down the Summers motion, 45-53-2.There are 59 Republicans in the House and 41 Democrats. Two Republicans, Moore Capito of Kanawha County and Larry Kump of Berkeley County, were absent today.A couple of Republican delegates spoke up with criticism of the bill.Delegate Pat McGeehan, R-Hancock, objected to the constitutionality of the many aspects of law addressed by the bill. He also expressed concern about the estimated $200 million cost.Senate President Mitch Carmichael, a main advocate for the big education bill, expressed disappointment but said he would continue to fight for educational policy changes.“Unfortunately today the champions of the status quo won,” said Carmichael, R-Jackson. “But that will not stop progress. They’re on the wrong side of history.”The Republican-led Senate voted Monday to restore up to seven charter schools and 1,000 education savings accounts, which are for students leaving public school for private education.Carmichael said yesterday the House had indicated there were 52 votes to pass those changes.“They had a caucus and committed to 52 votes, and I said ‘OK, we’re going to run it,” Carmichael recounted.But somewhere, somehow that number changed.“We had an agreement. They had a commitment of 52 votes. If they hadn’t committed, we wouldn’t have run the amendment,” Carmichael said.“What I’ll say is one’s word is all you have in this building. So you need to honor your word.”Carmichael also addressed comments by Gov. Jim Justice, a fellow Republican, on the opposite side of the proposed education changes.“That’s just the way things go with him,” Carmichael said. “He comes out and said, ‘Just pass a clean bill. Just give them a pay raise.’ People don’t want that.

Corporal punishment and harsh verbal abuse may cause a child to be fearful in the short term but does not improve behavior over the long term and may cause more aggressive behaviors. Image: Clipart.com Corporal punishment – or the use of spanking as a disciplinary tool –increases aggression in young children in the long run and is ineffective in teaching a child responsibility and self-control, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) . In fact, new evidence suggests that it may cause harm to the child by affecting normal brain development. Other methods that teach children right from wrong are safer and more effective.According to a press release issued last week by the AAP, corporal punishment and harsh verbal abuse may cause a child to be fearful in the short term but does not improve behavior over the long term and may cause more aggressive behaviors. In one study, young children who were spanked more than twice a month at age 3 were more aggressive at age 5. Those same children at age 9 still exhibited negative behaviors and lower receptive vocabulary scores, according to AAP research.Research has shown that striking a child, yelling at or shaming them can elevate stress hormones and lead to changes in the brain’s architecture. Harsh verbal abuse is also linked to mental health problems in preteens and adolescents.AAP will be strengthening its call to ban corporal punishment within an updated policy statement, “Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children,” which will be presented during the group’s 2018 National Conference & Exhibition in Orlando.The policy statement, to be published in the December 2018 issue of Pediatrics,  also addresses the harm associated with verbal punishment, such as shaming or humiliation. The AAP supports educating parents on more effective discipline strategies that teach appropriate behavior and protect the child and others from harm.“The good news is, fewer parents support the use of spanking than they did in the past,” said Robert D. Sege, MD, PhD, and a past member of AAP Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, an author of the policy statement. “Yet corporal punishment remains legal in many states, despite evidence that it harms kids – not only physically and mentally, but in how they perform at school and how they interact with other children.”Experts hope to help families devise more effective disciplinary plans that help them to maintain a calm and controlled demeanor.“It’s best to begin with the premise of rewarding positive behavior,” said Benjamin S. Siegel, MD, FAAP, co-author of the policy statement. “Parents can set up rules and expectations in advance. The key is to be consistent in following through with them.”AAP recommends that pediatricians use their influence in office visits to help parents with age-appropriate strategies for handling their child’s discipline. They also may refer families to community resources for more intensive or targeted help.The policy statement provides educational resources where physicians and parents can learn healthy forms of discipline, such as limit setting, redirecting and setting expectations.AAP also opposes corporal punishment in schools, which is addressed in a separate policy statement published in 2000.“There’s no benefit to spanking,” Dr. Sege said. “We know that children grow and develop better with positive role modeling and by setting healthy limits. We can do better.”Campus Safety magazine is another great resource for public safety, security and emergency management professionals.

The topic of gay marriage has been an important issue since the 1970s. According to according to Ralph Wedgewood , the topic brings up many questions: What is marriage? What would same-sex marriages mean for us? Is it something really worth fighting for? Many people think gay marriage should be legalized in all 50 states. Other, more moderate people believe that gay marriage should not be legalized, but that gay unions should be allowed. There is a third and final group of conservatives that think no form of gay union should be legalized. I tend to agree more with the first group. Gay marriage should be legalized in all 50 states because if not, this would be a violation of their constitutional rights. Many people think that the only reason gay and lesbian couples want legal recognition for there marriages is to ruin the institution of marriage between a man and a woman. This is completely false. Many gay and lesbian couples only want a legally recognized marriage so that they can share the same rights, obligations and benefits as heterosexual couples. Gays and lesbians should share equal rights with everyone else. It is unfair to discriminate against someone just because of sexual orientation. California was the first state to allow gay marriage but then it was taken back through Proposition 8. Many people think the right of marriage is fundamental to our society, and that you should not be excluded just because of your sexual preference. People say that marriage is used mainly for procreation, and that since gay couples can’t share this that there is no need for them to marry. Paul Evdokimov, a religious scholar, said that marriage is the act of giving oneself wholly to another. Just because gay couples can’t procreate doesn’t mean they can’t give themselves to one another and have any less of a loving relationship then a heterosexual couple. Heather George was quoted as saying, “If marriage is redefined out of existence, our entire society will be harmed.” Many people have been fighting very hard to end even the discussion of gay marriage in our legislature. In California, they were very successful in overturning the gay marriage law through Proposition 8. This was the most monetarily supported campaign on the ballot that year except for the presidential campaign. Through this, you can obviously see that this is a very important topic to many people on both sides. Both groups make very good arguments in their favor. Many people view gay and lesbian relationships as immoral and an abomination to begin with, and to add the thought of legalizing their marriages rocks people’s religious beliefs to the core. Religion is used as a main argument against gay marriage. Religious scholars attest to the fact that the Bible specifically states that homosexual relationships are an abomination and should not be encouraged by legalizing gay marriages. They also believe that this would not only affect the individuals, but that growing up in a homosexual home would also affect any children they might have. Rick Santorum argues that it is not necessarily about making the argument as to why they want to be married as much as it is about why their marriages would be beneficial to society as a whole. Gay marriage is a very serious topic effecting our conservations in today’s world. If it is not dealt with, it will just grow into a bigger and bigger deal. Many people are heavily involved in the process to legalize gay marriage. Jeff Young is heavily involved in the process to legalize gay marriage. He shares viewpoints very similar to mine.

Bob Latta (R-Ohio), Cathy Anne McMorris Rodgers (R-Washington)  and Greg Walden (R-Oregon) announced at a Subcommittee on Communications & Technology hearing that they would introduce separate pieces of legislation they falsely claim will protect the open internet. Full text for all of these bills was not immediately available or public when Republican members referenced them at the hearing. If passed in reported form, these bills would legalize numerous harmful and discriminatory practices while preventing the Federal Communications Commission from adopting and enforcing rules to protect internet users going forward. These pieces of legislation all would open the door to new ways for ISPs to discriminate and leave the FCC without sufficient authority to prevent any abuses. Free Press Action Vice President of Policy and General Counsel Matt Wood made the following statement: “If you want a few unregulated companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon to control the future of communications, these bills are for you. But fortunately, most internet users — no matter their political affiliation or walk in life — don’t want these bills at all. They want real protections for internet openness, competition and affordability, and they know that essential communications networks deserve these basic protections. “Despite what the new House minority claims, none of these bills would safeguard Net Neutrality or internet users’ rights. They would instead undermine the FCC’s ability to protect people online by removing broadband and wireless companies from nearly all agency oversight. “The cable industry wants rules that wouldn’t have stopped the streaming-video slowdowns of 2014. These bills wouldn’t address or let the FCC address new dirty tricks that cable operators might dream up. They wouldn’t give the FCC the authority to look into unreasonable data caps or other unjust practices, such as refusing to serve a customer unless they pass a strict credit check. These bills would enable ISPs to exercise their gatekeeper power with almost no restraint. “What Representatives Latta, McMorris Rodgers and Walden are actually trying to do is permanently declaw the FCC, the one agency responsible for protecting the public interest in communications. Having lost their fight against Net Neutrality in the court of public opinion, and at risk of losing again soon in the court of law, companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are trying to use fake Net Neutrality bills to end all effective oversight of their anti-competitive, anti-consumer practices. “These industry-written pieces of legislation shouldn’t be taken seriously by any legislator who claims to support Net Neutrality. Lawmakers need to reject fake compromises. The public overwhelmingly supports real Net Neutrality and wants to see decisive action to restore all of the essential protections the Pai FCC took away. “The solution is simple: Title II is in no way, shape or form a burdensome law for broadband. It’s the law that a bipartisan Congress wrote for all telecom networks, including internet access. Returning to it would restore the FCC’s critical authority to prevent harmful discrimination, and also to promote competition, universal service and access, interconnection, public safety and general consumer protections in an increasingly concentrated market. “We need real Net Neutrality rules and strong laws to ensure that the internet remains a space where people can fight for racial and social justice, pursue economic opportunities and engage in political speech without risk of ISP interference. “That’s what the people in America want. If Representatives Latta, Walden, McMorris Rodgers and their fellow Republicans really want to honor their constituents’ wishes, they should restore the real thing rather than backing industry wish lists and pretending that’s good enough.” Free Press Action urges lawmakers to support new legislation that reflects the will of the people and to reject phony GOP Net Neutrality bills.Absent from the governor’s list of priorities for the upcoming fiscal year was his prior commitment to fully fund the Civic Information Consortium.An administrative-law judge issued a strong rebuke to Sinclair over its dishonest representations to the FCC.We respect your privacyThanks for signing up!Your PrivacyStrictly Necessary CookiesPerformance CookiesFunctional CookiesTargeting CookiesMore InformationActiveAlways ActiveWe use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, analyze site traffic and personalize content.

But fortunately, most internet users — no matter their political affiliation or walk in life — don’t want these bills at all. They want real protections for internet openness, competition and affordability, and they know that essential communications networks deserve these basic protections. “Despite what the new House minority claims, none of these bills would safeguard Net Neutrality or internet users’ rights. They would instead undermine the FCC’s ability to protect people online by removing broadband and wireless companies from nearly all agency oversight. “The cable industry wants rules that wouldn’t have stopped the streaming-video slowdowns of 2014. These bills wouldn’t address or let the FCC address new dirty tricks that cable operators might dream up. They wouldn’t give the FCC the authority to look into unreasonable data caps or other unjust practices, such as refusing to serve a customer unless they pass a strict credit check. These bills would enable ISPs to exercise their gatekeeper power with almost no restraint. “What Representatives Latta, McMorris Rodgers and Walden are actually trying to do is permanently declaw the FCC, the one agency responsible for protecting the public interest in communications. Having lost their fight against Net Neutrality in the court of public opinion, and at risk of losing again soon in the court of law, companies like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon are trying to use fake Net Neutrality bills to end all effective oversight of their anti-competitive, anti-consumer practices. “These industry-written pieces of legislation shouldn’t be taken seriously by any legislator who claims to support Net Neutrality. Lawmakers need to reject fake compromises. The public overwhelmingly supports real Net Neutrality and wants to see decisive action to restore all of the essential protections the Pai FCC took away. “The solution is simple: Title II is in no way, shape or form a burdensome law for broadband. It’s the law that a bipartisan Congress wrote for all telecom networks, including internet access. Returning to it would restore the FCC’s critical authority to prevent harmful discrimination, and also to promote competition, universal service and access, interconnection, public safety and general consumer protections in an increasingly concentrated market. “We need real Net Neutrality rules and strong laws to ensure that the internet remains a space where people can fight for racial and social justice, pursue economic opportunities and engage in political speech without risk of ISP interference. “That’s what the people in America want. If Representatives Latta, Walden, McMorris Rodgers and their fellow Republicans really want to honor their constituents’ wishes, they should restore the real thing rather than backing industry wish lists and pretending that’s good enough.” Free Press Action urges lawmakers to support new legislation that reflects the will of the people and to reject phony GOP Net Neutrality bills.Absent from the governor’s list of priorities for the upcoming fiscal year was his prior commitment to fully fund the Civic Information Consortium.An administrative-law judge issued a strong rebuke to Sinclair over its dishonest representations to the FCC.We respect your privacyThanks for signing up!Your PrivacyStrictly Necessary CookiesPerformance CookiesFunctional CookiesTargeting CookiesMore InformationActiveAlways ActiveWe use cookies to offer you a better browsing experience, analyze site traffic and personalize content.

2,Euthanasia & Assisted Suicide,Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?,2s2q2r,https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/assisted-suicide-threatens-the-entire-medical-profession-maryland-doctor-warns-85212,"Assisted suicide threatens the entire medical profession, Maryland doctor warns","Baltimore, Md., Feb 19, 2019 / 01:14 pm ().- Assisted suicide contradicts the foundations of medical ethics, violates the basic standards of medical care, and threatens people who most need the assistance of the medical profession, warned a doctor who is opposing Maryland’s proposal to legalize the practice.“If we allow this form of euthanasia into our health care system, it will inevitably corrode and destroy the values that define the health professions and lead to public trust in them,” said Dr. Joseph Marine, a Maryland cardiologist. “No one will be immune to its long-term corrosive and destructive effects on the health care system.”Marine is a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who has practiced medicine for close to 20 years. He is also a member of the coalition Maryland Against Physician Assisted Suicide.His Feb. 18 essay in the Baltimore Sun made a case against a proposal in the state legislature to legalize assisted suicide.“Physician-assisted suicide is not medical care,” Marine said. “It has no basis in medical science or medical tradition. It is not taught in medical schools or residency training programs.” The drug combinations used to end patients’ lives “come from the euthanasia movement and not from the medical profession or medical research.”The doctor warned that “patients will not trust physicians who prescribe death.”Laws permitting assisted suicide create a new class of “human beings denied the protection of the law” and hinders the work of medical professionals who are “committed to preserving rather than taking life,” he said.Marine’s commentary followed the introduction of the “End-of-Life Option Act” in both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly earlier this year, listed as House Bill 399 and Senate Bill 311. If passed, the bill would permit doctors to prescribe lethal medications to patients with a terminal illness and an estimated six months left to live, while protecting prescribing doctors from prosecution. The bill would supersede a 1999 ban on assisted suicide.The proposal is supported by Compassion and Choices, an Oregon-based group formerly known as the Hemlock Society, which advocates for assisted suicide.Delegate Shane Pendergrass, a Democrat from Howard County who chairs the Health and Government Operations Committee is again sponsoring the bill after previous years’ versions were withdrawn before being voted down.“Every person is one bad death away from supporting this bill,” she said. “Many of us have been there and many of us are on the way to another one of those.”Pendergrass said she believes the bill can pass this year, the Baltimore Sun reported. The legislation has a new co-sponsor, Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee vice-chairman Sen. Will Smith, a Montgomery County Democrat.For Marine, physician-assisted suicide is a dangerous practice, with promised safeguards “an illusion.”“Suicidal impulses of everyone else in society are treated with crisis intervention,” said Marine, who argued that patients who qualify for legal assisted suicide are denied such intervention and are “tacitly or explicitly encouraged to take their own lives.”He objected to the lack of required formal psychiatric evaluation and minimal informed consent for a patient seeking assisted suicide. No witnesses are required for the consumption of the lethal drugs, and legal assisted suicide proposal lacks routine audits and impartial third-party oversight.“In addition, physicians and other participants are given broad legal immunity and records are excluded from legal discovery or subpoena. There is no accountability,” Marine said in his Baltimore Sun essay.In practice, assisted suicide means prescribing a non-FDA-approved lethal overdose of a drug or drugs to a person “believed to have a terminal illness.”In Washington state, doctors experimenting with new physician-assisted suicide drug cocktails caused some patients to scream in pain before dying, said Marine, who cited a Kaiser Health News report published Feb. 16, 2017 in USA Today.The lack of medical witnesses for 80 percent of patient deaths in assisted suicide means it is unknown whether complications took place.Marine said assisted suicide advocates make false assumptions about the reliability of a terminal medical prognosis. Some patients who received a prescription for assisted suicide drugs, but did not use it, continued living for several years. In practice, doctors are unable to determine whether a patient considered “terminal” has six months to live with “sufficient reliability,” Marine said. This means some patients would die needlessly.The “vast majority” of doctors will not take part in assisted suicide, he added. Where it is legalized, almost all prescriptions are “written by a small handful of doctors who may know little about the patients requesting it.”After the District of Columbia legalized doctor-assisted suicide in 2017, only two of the 11,000 licensed physicians signed up to prescribe the relevant drugs, Marine reported.Marine cited opposition to physician-assisted suicide from the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the American Nurses Association, the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization and the World Medical Association. Almost all disability rights organizations also oppose the practice.Doctor-assisted suicide has led to wider forms of euthanasia in every country that has legalized it, he said.Marine praised Maryland’s palliative and hospice care, saying its programs are recognized as among the best in the country. He said support for these programs should be the primary focus of the state legislature, and not assisted suicide.Maryland’s latest assisted suicide bill is the fourth proposal in five years. Similar bills were introduced in 2015, 2016 and 2017 but were withdrawn before they could be voted down.The legislation has also drawn opposition from the Maryland Catholic Conference, the Maryland Psychiatric Society and Baltimore City Medical Society.“As Catholics we stand firm with our partners across the state to strongly oppose this legislation,” Jennifer Briemann, executive director of the Maryland Catholic Conference, said Feb. 1.“Our state has repeatedly rejected this group’s agenda and with good reason: assisted-suicide threatens Maryland’s most vulnerable, putting those with disabilities, the elderly, our veterans, and those battling prescription drug addiction at grave risk,” she said.Assisted suicide is legal in seven U.S. states and the District of Columbia.Our mission is the truth.

12,School Uniforms,Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?,1s12q4r,http://articles.mcall.com/2013-01-11/news/mc-allentown-school-uniforms-20130111_1_uniform-policy-uniforms-next-school-year-uniform-issue,Allentown students to wear uniforms next school year - tribunedigital-mcall,"Goodbye jeans and T-shirts, plunging necklines and pants that hang so low on the posterior that you have to avert your eyes.Starting next school year, all Allentown School District students will be required to wear uniforms under a plan the school board Education Committee approved Thursday.The committee voted 8-1 after hearing a presentation from Superintendent Russ Mayo, staff and students. The board will formalize the committee's decision at its Jan. 24 meeting.The colors and styles of the shirts, pants, belts and shoes have not been decided. Nor has the administration worked out the consequences for students who do not comply.Those rules will be presented to the committee Feb. 14, with a board vote to follow later that month.But the decision to require uniforms — after nearly a decade of off-and-on-debate — was praised by students, staff and most directors. They said uniforms will reduce bullying, teasing and disruption while also being a cheaper alternative for poor parents who struggle every year to afford new school clothes for their children.Allen High teacher Kim Burke, who served on a steering committee that studied the uniform issue for eight months, said uniforms could cut down on violence. Earlier this school year, a large fight broke out after a student was teased for supposedly wearing knockoff jeans, she said.Whatever style of clothing is chosen, Burke said, students should be forbidden from wearing coats in class. Coats can hide contraband or weapons. On Tuesday, an Allen student was caught with a loaded handgun tucked into his waistband.""Parents wanted [the uniform policy] five to six years ago and they do not want it to start in high school,"" Burke said. ""They want it in all grades.""Dieruff High School Assistant Principal Patrick McNulty said a majority of freshmen and sophomores he surveyed wants uniforms.Dieruff senior Christina Milburn agreed. Milburn, who is the school's student body representative to the committee, said uniforms will be cheaper for students and parents to buy. Uniforms also will put all students on the same financial and stylish playing field, she said.""Last year, I saw a kid picking on another kid for wearing shoes from Payless,"" Milburn said.Mayo said uniforms won't solve school safety or academic problems. He said volumes of research praise or criticize the impact school uniforms have.But he said a school is a workplace for learning, and uniforms will help foster that workplace mentality for students and the community.A uniform policy is different from a dress code. A dress code outlines the do's and don'ts of daily dress. A uniform policy dictates students wear the same style and color shirts and pants or skirts.Since the 1980s, federal courts have given schools more power to restrict student dress, speech and actions both on and off campus. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never tackled the issue of whether a public school district can implement a uniform policy.That has not stopped a growing number of school districts from requiring uniforms and dress codes for certain or all grades.In 2009-10, about 19 percent of public school principals reported that their schools required students to wear uniforms, an increase from 12 percent in 1999-2000, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.In Pennsylvania, districts including Reading, Stroudsburg Area, Pottstown, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh require student uniforms.Allentown would be the first district in the Lehigh Valley to require uniforms. It may not be the last.Basilio Bonilla, a member of the Bethlehem Area School Board, on Monday publicly broached the idea of school uniforms for many of the same reasons cited by Allentown staff, students and parents.In the late 1990s, Allentown implemented a voluntary school uniform policy at the elementary level.

Allentown students to wear uniforms next school year - tribunedigital-mcall Goodbye jeans and T-shirts, plunging necklines and pants that hang so low on the posterior that you have to avert your eyes.Starting next school year, all Allentown School District students will be required to wear uniforms under a plan the school board Education Committee approved Thursday.The committee voted 8-1 after hearing a presentation from Superintendent Russ Mayo, staff and students. The board will formalize the committee's decision at its Jan. 24 meeting.The colors and styles of the shirts, pants, belts and shoes have not been decided. Nor has the administration worked out the consequences for students who do not comply.Those rules will be presented to the committee Feb. 14, with a board vote to follow later that month.But the decision to require uniforms — after nearly a decade of off-and-on-debate — was praised by students, staff and most directors. They said uniforms will reduce bullying, teasing and disruption while also being a cheaper alternative for poor parents who struggle every year to afford new school clothes for their children.Allen High teacher Kim Burke, who served on a steering committee that studied the uniform issue for eight months, said uniforms could cut down on violence. Earlier this school year, a large fight broke out after a student was teased for supposedly wearing knockoff jeans, she said.Whatever style of clothing is chosen, Burke said, students should be forbidden from wearing coats in class. Coats can hide contraband or weapons. On Tuesday, an Allen student was caught with a loaded handgun tucked into his waistband.""Parents wanted [the uniform policy] five to six years ago and they do not want it to start in high school,"" Burke said. ""They want it in all grades.""Dieruff High School Assistant Principal Patrick McNulty said a majority of freshmen and sophomores he surveyed wants uniforms.Dieruff senior Christina Milburn agreed. Milburn, who is the school's student body representative to the committee, said uniforms will be cheaper for students and parents to buy. Uniforms also will put all students on the same financial and stylish playing field, she said.""Last year, I saw a kid picking on another kid for wearing shoes from Payless,"" Milburn said.Mayo said uniforms won't solve school safety or academic problems. He said volumes of research praise or criticize the impact school uniforms have.But he said a school is a workplace for learning, and uniforms will help foster that workplace mentality for students and the community.A uniform policy is different from a dress code. A dress code outlines the do's and don'ts of daily dress. A uniform policy dictates students wear the same style and color shirts and pants or skirts.Since the 1980s, federal courts have given schools more power to restrict student dress, speech and actions both on and off campus. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never tackled the issue of whether a public school district can implement a uniform policy.That has not stopped a growing number of school districts from requiring uniforms and dress codes for certain or all grades.In 2009-10, about 19 percent of public school principals reported that their schools required students to wear uniforms, an increase from 12 percent in 1999-2000, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.In Pennsylvania, districts including Reading, Stroudsburg Area, Pottstown, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh require student uniforms.Allentown would be the first district in the Lehigh Valley to require uniforms. It may not be the last.Basilio Bonilla, a member of the Bethlehem Area School Board, on Monday publicly broached the idea of school uniforms for many of the same reasons cited by Allentown staff, students and parents.In the late 1990s, Allentown implemented a voluntary school uniform policy at the elementary level. But that quickly petered out.The district's Safety Task Force, a panel of parents, administrators and teachers, voted for uniforms in 2008 and 2009. The board did not act.While Allentown school officials have debated the topic, publicly funded charter schools have embraced uniforms, which they use as selling points for parents worried about safety.As the debate continued, Allentown staff increasingly have complained about how difficult and awkward it is trying to get students to adhere to the district's dress code.When female teachers ask boys to pull up their pants, they get responses like ""why are you looking,"" Burke said.

But Arizona has the right to set such a problematic standard, despite such evidence as the recent study by a Stanford economist demonstrating that right-to-carry laws do not decrease the overall level of crime and perhaps even increase it.What Arizonans should not have the right to do is force such laissez-faire gun control standards on Maryland; nor should those who live in Alabama, Tennessee, Florida or any of the other states where concealed-handgun permits are much more easily acquired. Yet that's exactly what some in Congress would like to see happen.Under the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, sponsored by Florida Republican Rep. Cliff Stearns, every state except for Illinois (which bans concealed handguns entirely) would be required to honor concealed-carry permits issued by any other state. Thus, the lowest possible gun standards would prevail even in jurisdictions that have worked more diligently to keeps guns out of the hands of dangerous people.Think there's no way that Republicans, who customarily trumpet states' rights at the drop of a health care reform act, would allow the federal government to so blatantly ignore local prerogatives?

The reality is that local standards for permits vary wildly, and states with outrageously lax permit requirements have issued hundreds of thousands of them without much oversight.

I personally do not think it is an essential part of an adult’s diet as there are many other forms of food that people can get their nutrition intake from.

Moreover, these days cow’s milk has a number of replacements, which could be a reason as to why people don’t make cow’s milk an essential part of their diet.

Humans have genetically adapted to consume dairy, so much so that it comes naturally to them. As they evolved, they developed a better gut and enzymes to digest milk.

Where the candidate stands on 9 issues | PBS NewsHour,"Listen to our new podcast, 'The Last Continent'Listen to our new podcast, ‘The Last Continent’ Brooklyn-born Bernie Sanders is an Independent and nearly 30-year veteran of Congress who considers himself a democratic socialist. He marched on Washington in 1963, moved to Vermont the next year, and ultimately ran seven statewide races there (losing four, winning three). In 2016, the Vermont senator became the first Jewish candidate (and first non-Christian) to win a presidential primary. He tells high school students to argue with their parents and teachers, and is an ardent anti-war activist and advocate for military veterans. Sanders has been a popular mayor, a Senate committee chairman, an early social media and filibuster phenomenon, and once recorded a folk album in the style of William Shatner.Here is where he stands on nine key issues.In 2016, Sanders refused corporate donations and relied on small donors to fund his White House campaign. He has proposed a constitutional amendment that would effectively reverse the Supreme Court’s Citizen United ruling and ban corporations and nonprofits from unlimited campaign expenditures. The independent senator would also require any organization to disclose election-related campaign expenditures of $10,000 or more.Sanders would institute a carbon tax and aim to slash U.S. emissions by 40 percent by the year 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. He would end all federal subsidies for the gas, oil and coal industries. In addition, he would investigate corporations he sees as “climate deniers” that have spent money raising doubts about climate change. He is a co-sponsor of a resolution calling for a “Green New Deal”.The Vermont senator would make preschool free for all 4-year-olds, funding the plan by increasing taxes on the wealthy and some Wall Street transactions. In higher education, Sanders’ “College for All Act” would make tuition at four-year public colleges free for most Americans; two-thirds of the program would be paid for with federal funds, and one-third with state funds. Sanders would pay for the federal portion with what he calls a Wall Street speculation fee of 0.5 percent on stock trades.Sanders would divide large banks — those with assets worth more than 3 percent of the nation’s GDP — into smaller entities and charge a new fee for high-risk investment practices, including credit default swaps. He would also ban financial industry executives from serving on the central bank’s 12 regional boards of directors.A gun-control advocate, Sanders would ban assault weapons as well as high-capacity magazines or equipment that allow more than ten rounds to be fired at once. He supports universal background checks and voted for the Manchin-Toomey legislation expanding federal background checks.In early 2016, Sanders changed his position on a gun law that protects some gun manufacturers and sellers from civil lawsuits. Sanders supported the measure in 2005 while he was serving in the House of Representatives. In 2016, he co-sponsored a bill to repeal that law. In the House, Sanders also voted against the pro-gun-control Brady Bill, writing that he believes states, not the federal government, can handle waiting periods for handguns. He told student reporters from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that he voted no on the Brady Bill because his state preferred “automatic background checks” and not waiting periods.Sanders proposes a government-run health care system for all Americans. He was the lead Senate sponsor of the 2017 “Medicare For All” bill, which would launch universal health care and end employer-provided health insurance. Sanders’ team in the past has estimated the plan will cost $1.38 trillion a year. Others estimate the program would cost more than twice that amount. Sanders would fund the plan through multiple sources: a 6.2 percent charge on employers, a 2.2 percent fee on most families, increased marginal tax rates for incomes $250,000 and higher, increased taxes on capital gains, and a larger estate tax for the wealthiest. Under the plan, the top individual income tax rate would be 52 percent.Most undocumented immigrants who are in the country now would receive a path to citizenship under Sanders’ immigration plan. He voted for the 2013 Senate immigration bill that proposed a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, doubling the number of border patrol officers, and providing an additional 350 miles of border fencing. (That bill did not become law.)Sanders would like to restructure ICE. But he has not given details and has not gone so far as to say that he thinks the agency should be “abolished,” a position some of his 2020 Democratic rivals have taken. Sanders is a supporter of abortion rights and voted against a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks. When asked in 2016 if he would place any limits on abortions, Sanders did not give a specific answer but repeatedly said he was “very strongly pro-choice” and believed the decision was between a woman and her doctor.On LGBTQ rights, Sanders has touted his early moves in support of the gay rights movement. In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he approved a resolution declaring “Gay Rights Day;” in 1993, he opposed the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy; and in 2000 he supported gay civil unions in Vermont. He opposes President Donald Trump’s push to ban transgender people from the military, and laws that would block transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice.Sanders would pull U.S. troops from Syria, but said he would do it in a different, less “erratic” way than Trump recently announced. He believes diplomacy with Russia and Iran can turn things around in Syria. He also believes the president did not have the right to launch airstrikes against the Assad regime and that war powers must get more rigorous oversight and/or approval from Congress. A longtime anti-war activist, Sanders voted against the Iraq war resolution in 2002. He regularly called for the U.S. to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. In both Afghanistan and Syria, Sanders has said that he believes the U.S. should remain involved, though with no ground troop presence.Sanders would end all U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, and was a main co-sponsor of the bipartisan bill passed by the Senate to force the Pentagon to end its involvement there. In a tweet, Sanders wrote that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman has murdered activists, heads a despotic regime and should be held accountable.",2,3,Against,Neutral,Not-about,0,No majority,"['Against', 'Neutral', 'Not-about']","Should the Government Allow Immigrants Who Are Here Illegally to Become US Citizens?

15,College Education Worth It,Is a College Education Worth It?,2s15q5r,https://diverseeducation.com/article/139028/,How to Get More Money for College - Higher Education,"As a journalist who has covered college admission for many years, I’ve seen firsthand how students and families struggle to make sense of the financial aid award letters they get from colleges.At a charter school in New Orleans, for example, I saw a student who didn’t initially understand that even though she was being offered $32,000 in scholarship aid from her dream school – a private liberal arts college – she still would have been in major debt upon graduation since that amount only covered one year of tuition.In another case, I saw an immigrant father ask why his son couldn’t enroll in his first-choice college – even though the family didn’t have enough to cover all four years – and then just try to hustle up the rest of the money they needed to cover sophomore year. And he would have taken that route had a financial aid adviser not discouraged him by warning him that sophomore year comes quicker than you think – and how it would be better to settle on a second-choice school that was offering a better financial aid package.I can’t help but wonder if these situations – and the many others just like them that play out every year – might have turned out differently if these students and their parents had known something about the art of appeal.At least that’s what I’ve been thinking since I read a new book from financial aid guru Mark Kantrowitz, titled How to Appeal for More College Financial Aid: The Secrets to Negotiating a Better Financial Aid Offer … and Getting More Financial Aid in the First Place!“The more you know, the better position you are in to negotiate,” Kantrowitz writes. “So, do your research in advance.”Indeed, the book is chock-full with both simple and sophisticated insights for anyone interested in learning more about how to squeeze as much money out of a college as possible within the framework of the law. That would include students, parents and financial aid advisers.I myself am finding tremendous value in the book as I try to help my 19-year-old stepson from a former marriage secure a good financial aid offer. His mother passed away recently and his father was disabled after being shot. He also spent some time in foster care.According to Kantrowitz’s book, these circumstances all represent the kinds of things that the college financial aid administrator should know.“Generally, college financial aid administrators are more likely to make an adjustment when a special circumstance is due to factors beyond the family’s control, such as job loss or disability related expenses, as opposed to discretionary choices,” Kantrowitz writes.The book goes into great detail about just what constitutes a “special circumstance.” It involves things such as furloughs or paycheck reductions, but not lifestyle decisions like going to the casino or cable TV. The book also stresses the importance of being able to document that the circumstance is real – preferably through an independent third party. So instead of just talking about having an unusually high child care bill, for instance, it would be better to have a copy of the actual bill.The book also mentions a variety of other circumstances that students – including adult students – can try to use to get a better offer. For example, if your spouse has abused you or been sent to jail or prison but you’re still legally married, you can seek to have your status changed from married to unmarried for purposes of financial aid, the book states.The book is not only for those facing hard times – far from it. There’s plenty of nuggets of wisdom, tips and tricks for those who are more well o or who run their own business – things such as changing a business’s tax status or taking a voluntary salary reduction to lower your income for financial aid purposes.Not everyone is happy with the book. For instance, Charlie, the first person to review the book on Amazon.com – and who gave it just one star – lamented how disappointed he was to learn that the book concedes that “successful appeals are rare.”“The bulk of this book is how to position yourself in advance — not an appeal — to get more need-based aid and charts on which schools give more aid,” Charlie complains. “Very, very little is on how to get more aid after receiving a disappointing awards letter.”But if you think about it, Charlie’s complaint is actually a compliment of sorts.The main complaint I have is that the book doesn’t have footnotes. It does have a rather lengthy set of appendixes – 90 pages worth, in fact – and I’m not convinced people will bother reading them.Shortcomings aside, I would still give the book five stars.Many people will only apply for college once in their lives.

38,Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?,2s38q9r,https://forward.com/scribe/409555/what-palestinians-mean-when-they-talk-about-a-two-state-solution/,What Palestinians Mean When They Say Two-State Solution – The Forward,"Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas (C) talks to the media during his visit to the Pilgrims City, in the West Bank town of Jericho on August 6, 2018.At a recent campaign-style rally, President Donald Trump said that Israel is going to have to pay a “higher price” in future negotiations for his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The Palestinians, he added, “will get something very good, because it’s their turn next. Let’s see what happens.” Whether this was an off-the-cuff remark or preparation before his long-anticipated grand strategy to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, this or a future administration will again be pressuring the parties to accept its version of a two state solution.To American ears, the meaning of “two states” is unambiguously straightforward. The struggle between Israel and the Palestinians, to them, is a struggle between two indigenous peoples fighting over the same space of land in which they share a history. A fair solution, then, would be one in which Israel is the state of the Jewish people, and alongside it will exist a separate Palestinian State.But in the Middle East, nothing is easily understood or obviously clear. American negotiators, many American supporters of Israel and Israelis themselves use the term “two states” believing its definition is self-explanatory and accepted by all parties — but this is far from the case.To Palestinians on both sides of the green line, “two states” is a capitulation that would leave one small state, Palestine, for indigenous people, and one state, Israel, would be given to the oppressive foreign colonialists.Shlomo Avineri, a well-respected Professor Emeritus of Political Science at the Hebrew University, outlined this view in a 2015 column for Haaretz:“According to the Palestinians’ view, this is not a conflict between two national movements but a conflict between one national movement (the Palestinian) and a colonial and imperialistic [sic] entity (Israel). According to this view, Israel will end like all colonial phenomena — it will perish and disappear. Moreover, according to the Palestinian view, the Jews are not a nation but a religious community, and as such not entitled to national self-determination which is, after all, a universal imperative.”Of course, the natural conclusion of this view is that the American conception of “two states for two peoples” is not a fair or an acceptable solution. From my extensive experience speaking with Palestinian leaders and laymen alike, I have come to learn that the Palestinian version of the two state solution leaves no room for a Jewish state.This year, I lead an in-depth seminar in Israel trying to understand what Palestinian citizens of Israel want in the 21st century.To almost all Palestinian citizens of Israel I spoke with, from Arab mayors to teachers, a state of the Jewish people is illegitimate in their eyes; Zionism is a colonizing enterprise of Jews stealing Arab land. Judaism, to them, is exclusively a religion, without a legitimate civilizational or national aspirational component. They view the Jewish historical claim to the land as fictional and Zionism as racism.Their idea of a fair “two state solution” is one completely Arab state in the West Bank and one democratic binational State of Israel that allows the right of return for descendants of Palestinian refugees. It is a “two state solution,” but not the one American Jews would recognize or Israel could survive.I asked these Palestinian citizens of Israel if, were they to have every economic advantage Jewish Israelis have, even without performing any compulsory civil service, would they then consider Israel a legitimate democracy. Almost all said no: not until the Jewish star is removed from the flag, Hatikvah is no longer the national anthem and the right of return for Diaspora Jews to Israel is rescinded.In 2011, Fatah Foreign Relations Chief Nabil Shaath was very clear: . He said, “the story of ‘two-states for two peoples’ means that there will be a Jewish people over there and a Palestinian people here. We will never accept this… we will never agree to a clause preventing the Palestinian refugees from returning to their country.”Today in American politics, some candidates have abandoned any façade of a fair two state solution. The first Muslim American Congresswomen from Michigan, Rashida Tlaib, told Britain’s Channel 4 that she would “absolutely” vote against U.S. military aid to Israel, and declared that she believes in the ”one state” solution, i.e. the demographic destruction of Israel.There is little doubt that future American administrations will re-attempt negotiations with the Israelis and Palestinians in hopes of achieving some form of a two-state solution. But it would be wise, before proceeding, to have both parties sign an agreement that at the end of the negotiations, one of those states must be the State of the Jewish people, with the final resolution including a signed end-of-conflict agreement that unambiguously states that 100% of all Palestinian claims to that state are settled.The security of Israel, and the future of a Jewish state in the Middle East, depends on it.This story ""What Palestinians Mean When They Say Two-State Solution"" was written by Eric R.

16,Teacher Tenure,Should Teachers Get Tenure?,2s16q3r,https://www.kstatecollegian.com/2019/02/19/opinion-trumps-tenure-in-office-is-worth-frustration-not-panic/,"OPINION: Trump’s tenure in office is worth frustration, not panic | The Collegian","President Donald Trump. I remember the first time I heard it. He wasn’t in the role yet, someone just mentioned the concept to me. I laughed; it always seemed like a joke.When was I younger (single digits, I think), I asked my dad who Trump was after hearing his name on TV.“He’s one of the richest men in the world” was all he said.Unlike many young minds today, my mind didn’t immediately jump to “wealthy equals evil,” but I did think, “Well, he probably likes himself just a bit.”As years went by, I would hear about him sometimes and just started to think that he was very arrogant — and yes, stupid — but not necessarily in a way that put other people down.Read Now I’ve known people like this in my own life. They put others down for no reason, but they love to pull themselves up as high as they can. If you like them, they might take you on the ride up — as long as you do the same to them. However, if you dislike them, they will throw you down as hard as they can.These people don’t have a real set agenda or value system that makes them like or dislike others. They like those who like them and hate those who don’t like them. The current president falls into this category.This is why I was confused when Trump started being accused of racism, transphobia, Islamophobia and all the types of prejudice on the typical hate-trait list.It’s not hard to crank out this terminology. In fact, it’s lazy.It’s a lot easier to slander someone’s personal character and motivations with one of these common labels than to factually explain why they may be incorrect. President Trump does not fit into a small, hateful box; he’s more complicated than that. He’s not out to hurt people — honestly, I’m not sure he’s that calculated. There are valid reasons to be frustrated with him, but panic isn’t called for.All of this went through my head as my first election approached.In 2015, I was a senior in high school and had no idea what was happening with politics, but the polarization that was occurring forced all of us to learn. My friends and I laughed about the idea of “President Trump,” and we still do.I knew the presidential election was coming, and felt the burden to vote. I saw it as such an amazing opportunity. One of our teachers told us, “For those of you that are voting for the first time, I am sorry.”Read Now On the day of the Kansas caucus, I was traveling to see me brother. I was really disappointed to not vote and show where I stood. I didn’t want Trump (and those tweets) to represent the Republican Party; however, time with my brother mattered more to me. Family should always have priority over politics.The primary results came in. Looking back, I wonder why we expected anything different. Trump was a direct product of our selfish culture, no matter what side of politics you’re on. We like people who compliment us and are rude to those who put us down. Don’t be surprised by him.Why was he always placed right in the center of the debates? Why did the moderators ask the other candidates questions about him? It’s because he puts on such a good show and knows how to appeal to crowds. The political right wanted someone like this at the time: someone who packed a punch.The primary left me with two options: Trump or Hillary Clinton. On one hand, Clinton wasn’t trustworthy. It was difficult for me to side with someone who said “Vote for me because I’m a woman.” Seeing a female president would be incredible, but I’m not going to vote for someone just because of their sex.Other issues continued to turn me away from Clinton. The Benghazi incident was scary. I couldn’t stand her position on abortion, which she’s continued to promote. She defended her husband’s conduct while in office after he had an affair. She flipped her view on gay marriage when it became socially accepted. She always seemed hungry for power, and Trump seemed to just want the status of the office. Fall came and I was starting college. I wasn’t sure who to support, but I did know that some issues would guide my vote.One was the issue of abortion. Whoever won the election was going to appoint the next Supreme Court justice — a decision that would be pivotal, as the justices were on the bench for life. I knew the Democratic Party was creeping toward making abortion limits later and later, and Clinton would likely appoint a justice who shared those ideals. Despite this, I was still afraid of what Trump would do to the Republican Party.In 2016, at the Republican National Convention, Senator Ted Cruz didn’t endorse Trump. Although he was ridiculed for not giving his support then, how could he after what Trump said about Cruz’s father and wife? He had told the crowd to vote with their conscience. I thought it was such an honorable thing to do.Read Now In the midst of my indecision, Evan McMullin from Utah started a large write-in campaign literally saying, “It’s never too late to do the right thing.”This was an appealing option to me, as it seemed to be a way to “vote with my conscience.” If I could “vote with my conscience,” maybe my voice could be heard — instead of just submitting to “the system,” whatever that may be.While voting for a third party felt like a righteous thing to do, a small, nagging part of me kept saying it would just help Clinton. Call it a flip-flop, but about a week before election day, Senator Cruz was back on TV, saying someone should vote for Trump if they didn’t want to see a Clinton presidency. I knew he was right. Trump being Trump, Cruz went from being “lying Ted” to a “brilliant opponent,” and most recently, “beautiful Ted.” Cruz supported Trump, and then the praises came.The choice was difficult. Neither Trump nor Clinton offered good character, but I think America gave up on that a long time ago in favor of policy and party. With a focus on policy, and just over 48 hours to go before election day, I decided to put Trump at the top of my ballot. I felt conflicted about it even on the way home from my polling location.The day after the election wasn’t a celebration. My friends and I didn’t know what would come next. I’ve watched carefully since Nov. 8, 2016. Trump’s policy choices have been controversial. But neither his policy nor his conduct has been evidence of the prejudiced terminology listed above.Trump has celebrated low black unemployment. He wore a rainbow flag on his back at a rally. He works with many Hispanic people and women, many of whom he appointed and praises.It’s easy to criticize a man by just cranking out hasty generalizations. While the simple diagnosis of these criticisms is compelling, they miss the nature of the president and fuel political polarization.While the political left loves to criticize Trump because he’s “the next Hitler,” he “colluded with Russia” or he’s a “liar,” I believe there are so many other, more productive ways to analyze him.First, President Trump is not a uniquely wise man. This is why I never believed in the Trump-Russia collusion narrative — not because I think highly of him, but because I don’t think he’s smart enough to pull that off and hide it.Second, he lies, but when he lies, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “Mexico will pay for the wall” was never going to happen. He thought it sounded good in the moment, so he said it.When someone runs their mouth, they are often asked what they were thinking. This is not a great question, because they weren’t. It’s a characteristic of the biblical fool; Proverbs 18:2 states, “A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion.”Read Now As a side note, this is a different type of lie than the fully-aware lies that former president Barack Obama would tell. Obama’s lies would result in policy. “’If you like your health care plan, you can keep it’” was PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year in 2013.Third, Trump likes to please whoever is in the room. After the horrendous school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year (almost to the date), Trump talked about gun control and began moves toward banning bump stocks. Why? Simply because there were Democrats in the room smiling at him! He will please anyone as long as it makes them like him.This is why I don’t get it when someone says that Trump is like Hitler. This is false. Here’s the key difference between Trump and Hitler: Hitler had a set ideology from the start. Trump is there pleasing whoever is around him at the time.Quick, lazy generalizations need to end. The country is so polarized right now, and that’s because both sides are driving people into the arms of the other with their insane rhetoric.The media says stupid, untrue things, and the Republicans run to Trump. Trump says something absurd, and the Democrats run to the media. Everything is so reactionary these days, and it’s our collective fault.You may not like him, but in order to solve any issue, we should get rid of the idea that there’s an evil, old, rich, greedy man out there who wants to hurt people. It’s not real. The reality is that Trump wants supporters who make him feel good. Do you think you can solve your own problems? Is some evil man far away going to ruin that for you? Are you angry, but willing to do your work every day? Are you thrilled because the great leader is here to end the tyranny of the eight years before him? Are you terrified because the new Hitler is here? I voted for Trump because of his policy, not his personality, and those who fall into this category are often some of his greatest critics.You won’t hear us walk around saying who we voted for, or even our political affiliations. That’s because it doesn’t really concern us. We know that Trump, or any other president, is ultimately not responsible for the state of our lives. That’s on us. We work, do our best and vote. Whether you like him, don’t like him, love him, hate him, are indifferent or don’t care, one thing is clear: President Trump has revealed the hearts of everyone in the country.

OPINION: Trump’s tenure in office is worth frustration, not panic | The Collegian President Donald Trump. I remember the first time I heard it. He wasn’t in the role yet, someone just mentioned the concept to me. I laughed; it always seemed like a joke.When was I younger (single digits, I think), I asked my dad who Trump was after hearing his name on TV.“He’s one of the richest men in the world” was all he said.Unlike many young minds today, my mind didn’t immediately jump to “wealthy equals evil,” but I did think, “Well, he probably likes himself just a bit.”As years went by, I would hear about him sometimes and just started to think that he was very arrogant — and yes, stupid — but not necessarily in a way that put other people down.Read Now I’ve known people like this in my own life. They put others down for no reason, but they love to pull themselves up as high as they can. If you like them, they might take you on the ride up — as long as you do the same to them. However, if you dislike them, they will throw you down as hard as they can.These people don’t have a real set agenda or value system that makes them like or dislike others. They like those who like them and hate those who don’t like them. The current president falls into this category.This is why I was confused when Trump started being accused of racism, transphobia, Islamophobia and all the types of prejudice on the typical hate-trait list.It’s not hard to crank out this terminology. In fact, it’s lazy.It’s a lot easier to slander someone’s personal character and motivations with one of these common labels than to factually explain why they may be incorrect. President Trump does not fit into a small, hateful box; he’s more complicated than that. He’s not out to hurt people — honestly, I’m not sure he’s that calculated. There are valid reasons to be frustrated with him, but panic isn’t called for.All of this went through my head as my first election approached.In 2015, I was a senior in high school and had no idea what was happening with politics, but the polarization that was occurring forced all of us to learn. My friends and I laughed about the idea of “President Trump,” and we still do.I knew the presidential election was coming, and felt the burden to vote. I saw it as such an amazing opportunity. One of our teachers told us, “For those of you that are voting for the first time, I am sorry.”Read Now On the day of the Kansas caucus, I was traveling to see me brother. I was really disappointed to not vote and show where I stood. I didn’t want Trump (and those tweets) to represent the Republican Party; however, time with my brother mattered more to me. Family should always have priority over politics.The primary results came in. Looking back, I wonder why we expected anything different. Trump was a direct product of our selfish culture, no matter what side of politics you’re on. We like people who compliment us and are rude to those who put us down. Don’t be surprised by him.Why was he always placed right in the center of the debates? Why did the moderators ask the other candidates questions about him? It’s because he puts on such a good show and knows how to appeal to crowds. The political right wanted someone like this at the time: someone who packed a punch.The primary left me with two options: Trump or Hillary Clinton. On one hand, Clinton wasn’t trustworthy. It was difficult for me to side with someone who said “Vote for me because I’m a woman.” Seeing a female president would be incredible, but I’m not going to vote for someone just because of their sex.Other issues continued to turn me away from Clinton. The Benghazi incident was scary. I couldn’t stand her position on abortion, which she’s continued to promote. She defended her husband’s conduct while in office after he had an affair. She flipped her view on gay marriage when it became socially accepted. She always seemed hungry for power, and Trump seemed to just want the status of the office. Fall came and I was starting college. I wasn’t sure who to support, but I did know that some issues would guide my vote.One was the issue of abortion. Whoever won the election was going to appoint the next Supreme Court justice — a decision that would be pivotal, as the justices were on the bench for life. I knew the Democratic Party was creeping toward making abortion limits later and later, and Clinton would likely appoint a justice who shared those ideals. Despite this, I was still afraid of what Trump would do to the Republican Party.In 2016, at the Republican National Convention, Senator Ted Cruz didn’t endorse Trump. Although he was ridiculed for not giving his support then, how could he after what Trump said about Cruz’s father and wife? He had told the crowd to vote with their conscience. I thought it was such an honorable thing to do.Read Now In the midst of my indecision, Evan McMullin from Utah started a large write-in campaign literally saying, “It’s never too late to do the right thing.”This was an appealing option to me, as it seemed to be a way to “vote with my conscience.” If I could “vote with my conscience,” maybe my voice could be heard — instead of just submitting to “the system,” whatever that may be.While voting for a third party felt like a righteous thing to do, a small, nagging part of me kept saying it would just help Clinton. Call it a flip-flop, but about a week before election day, Senator Cruz was back on TV, saying someone should vote for Trump if they didn’t want to see a Clinton presidency. I knew he was right. Trump being Trump, Cruz went from being “lying Ted” to a “brilliant opponent,” and most recently, “beautiful Ted.” Cruz supported Trump, and then the praises came.The choice was difficult. Neither Trump nor Clinton offered good character, but I think America gave up on that a long time ago in favor of policy and party. With a focus on policy, and just over 48 hours to go before election day, I decided to put Trump at the top of my ballot. I felt conflicted about it even on the way home from my polling location.The day after the election wasn’t a celebration. My friends and I didn’t know what would come next. I’ve watched carefully since Nov. 8, 2016. Trump’s policy choices have been controversial. But neither his policy nor his conduct has been evidence of the prejudiced terminology listed above.Trump has celebrated low black unemployment. He wore a rainbow flag on his back at a rally. He works with many Hispanic people and women, many of whom he appointed and praises.It’s easy to criticize a man by just cranking out hasty generalizations. While the simple diagnosis of these criticisms is compelling, they miss the nature of the president and fuel political polarization.While the political left loves to criticize Trump because he’s “the next Hitler,” he “colluded with Russia” or he’s a “liar,” I believe there are so many other, more productive ways to analyze him.First, President Trump is not a uniquely wise man. This is why I never believed in the Trump-Russia collusion narrative — not because I think highly of him, but because I don’t think he’s smart enough to pull that off and hide it.Second, he lies, but when he lies, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. “Mexico will pay for the wall” was never going to happen. He thought it sounded good in the moment, so he said it.When someone runs their mouth, they are often asked what they were thinking. This is not a great question, because they weren’t.

I hope every tournament becomes hard to watch and ratings plummet until the USGA does something to start enforcing pace-of-play rules. Slow play in golf has been a problem for quite some time, but it has gotten much worse in recent years.Players such as Holmes, Bryson DeChambeau and many others on the PGA Tour seem to be in no hurry to hit the ball, and as a result rounds are creeping toward six hours to complete. That’s absurd, especially when you consider many country clubs have pace-of-play rules that essentially force groups to be done in somewhere between four and four and a half hours.In other words, foursomes full of hackers are expected to play faster than the best golfers in the world. The USGA and PGA Tour could speed these things up but refuse to do so. There have been exactly two penalties handed out for slow play in the last 23 years.Holmes may be the worst on tour right now, but there are plenty of others. It is a problem and one the late Arnold Palmer feared and made one of his talking points in the later years of his life. Palmer said slow golf is killing golf both at the recreational level and the PGA Tour. He said the USGA should be searching for ways to speed up rounds and that golf is dying in part because people don’t have the time to play it any more.A number of modern players feel the same way about it. Adam Scott was the latest golfer to say that until the TV executives and sponsors step in, there is no incentive for players to speed up. Brooks Koepka blasted slow play and said it was not necessary.“I just don’t understand how it takes a minute and 20 seconds, a minute and 15 seconds to hit a golf ball. It’s not that hard,” Koepka told the Golf Channel. “It’s always between two clubs. There’s a miss short, there’s a miss long. It really drives me nuts, especially when it’s a long hitter because you know you’ve got two other guys, or at least one guy that’s hitting before you, so you can do all your calculations. You should have your numbers.”Koepka added, “If it’s a calm day, there’s no excuse. Guys are already so slow, it’s kind of embarrassing. I just don’t get why you enforce some things and don’t enforce others.”Like many others, Koepka doesn’t blame the players; he blames the USGA for not enforcing rules that already exist. There is a warning to speed up, and players are then put on the clock. The next time the player takes too long to hit the ball there should be a one-stroke penalty. And every subsequent time there should be a penalty as well.That is how the USGA could make the game a little quicker and more enjoyable and also make the competition a little purer.One of the worst things allowed to happen is players essentially icing their playing partners by stalling and playing slowly. The most egregious example of this was Jordan Spieth in the 2017 British Open.Spieth was losing in the final round and the wheels were coming off a bit, and Matt Kuchar was playing a very smooth, steady round. On the 13th hole, Spieth hit an errant shot and took nearly 20 minutes to hit while Kuchar actually sat down and waited to hit in the middle of the fairway.Spieth used the time to regain his composure, and it clearly took Kuchar out of rhythm. Spieth came from behind to win. He was celebrated, but he should have been ripped, and that stalling act should have netted at least a two-stroke penalty.Penalty strokes can and would be the difference between making a cut and missing a cut, finishing in the top 10 or outside the top 10 and in some cases winning and losing.The USGA is obsessive when it comes to enforcing many other rules. The fact it won’t enforce this one is frustrating. This needs to change, or golf participation and interest will continue to decline.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is set to read George Washington’s Farewell Address aloud on the floor when the Senate returns to session next Monday afternoon. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) CAPITOL HILL – Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., will follow an annual tradition when the Senate meets again next week.The Senate returns to session next Monday afternoon. The first order of business is for Fischer to read George Washington’s Farewell Address aloud on the floor.The annual oration stands as one of the Senate’s most enduring customs.A senator has read the address every year since 1896.In recent years, the spectacle comes around Presidents’ Day.Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., had the honor last year. The list of readers includes the late Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., John McCain, R-Ariz., Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,  Hubert Humphrey, D.-Minn., and former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn.But this year, Washington’s 32-page valedictory screed bears more weight than in years past. Washington was retiring to Mount Vernon when he wrote the speech to “friends and fellow-citizens.” He used the manifest to warn Americans of the dangers of partisanship and politics if they were to maintain values in the fledgling United States.“It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another,” wrote Washington. “The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.”One wonders how many people will tune in to C-SPAN2 or digest Fischer’s recitation of Washington’s counsel next week.Most senators will be jetting back to the Beltway after the Presidents’ Day recess, not yet on the ground to hear Fischer’s presentation. That’s ironic considering the debate which now simmers over whether President Trump overstepped presidential authority to redistribute money for his border wall. This is especially prescient considering how lawmakers guard Congressional prerogatives. Ceding power of the purse to the executive establishes a new precedent in American government. This is precisely the concern Washington raised when he spoke of “encroachment” and limiting power within “constitutional spheres.”TRUMP NEEDS A TRANSFER, MAY HAVE TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAULPolicymakers always have exercised a healthy tension between the legislative branch and the executive branch. But none other than Alexander Hamilton called for what he characterized as “energy” in the executive when writing Federalist #70, the precursor set of documents which helped form the Constitution.Hamilton demanded an active executive to curb legislative overreaches and to pose as a bulwark against Congress. In this instance, Trump asserts there’s an emergency at the border. So he needs the wall. Maybe. Maybe not. But this is why the founders formed a system of checks and balances. There’s a question about just how much latitude the president has when it comes to repurposing funds Congress designated for something else. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse. All presidents can do is either sign or veto bills after lawmakers decide to spend money. Trump’s plan to rejigger billions of dollars of already appropriated spending by Congress could be a problem.Presidents long have tested the parameters of executive authority. President Woodrow Wilson declared a “national emergency” in 1917 because of an “insufficiency of maritime tonnage” to carry U.S. agricultural and manufacturing commodities. Congress approved the National Emergencies Act of 1976, granting presidents the ability to act on any number of priorities they may deem an emergency. Presidents have declared 58 national emergencies since 1976. Thirty-one are renewed each year.From a parliamentary perspective, Fox News is told that the National Emergencies Act is a legislative mess. It lacks focus, specificity and is inherently vague.“It is not the gold standard for writing legislation,” confided one source.That said, Congress can terminate declarations of national emergencies with the adoption of a joint resolution by both bodies of Congress. It needs a simple majority and must earn a presidential signature. If the president vetoes a House/Senate joint resolution, those bodies can move to override the veto with a two-thirds vote.The House likely would seek action to revoke the national emergency as it pertains to the wall. But this process is far thornier in the Senate. The statute contains imprecise verbiage as to how the Senate may consider the legislation and whether certain, special procedural motions fly in the face of debating the statute. For instance, the law requires the Senate to vote on overturning the national emergency after “three days.” But what constitutes “three days?” Three full days of debate?

Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is set to read George Washington’s Farewell Address aloud on the floor when the Senate returns to session next Monday afternoon. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) CAPITOL HILL – Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., will follow an annual tradition when the Senate meets again next week.The Senate returns to session next Monday afternoon. The first order of business is for Fischer to read George Washington’s Farewell Address aloud on the floor.The annual oration stands as one of the Senate’s most enduring customs.A senator has read the address every year since 1896.In recent years, the spectacle comes around Presidents’ Day.Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., had the honor last year. The list of readers includes the late Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., John McCain, R-Ariz., Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,  Hubert Humphrey, D.-Minn., and former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn.But this year, Washington’s 32-page valedictory screed bears more weight than in years past. Washington was retiring to Mount Vernon when he wrote the speech to “friends and fellow-citizens.” He used the manifest to warn Americans of the dangers of partisanship and politics if they were to maintain values in the fledgling United States.“It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another,” wrote Washington. “The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.”One wonders how many people will tune in to C-SPAN2 or digest Fischer’s recitation of Washington’s counsel next week.Most senators will be jetting back to the Beltway after the Presidents’ Day recess, not yet on the ground to hear Fischer’s presentation. That’s ironic considering the debate which now simmers over whether President Trump overstepped presidential authority to redistribute money for his border wall. This is especially prescient considering how lawmakers guard Congressional prerogatives. Ceding power of the purse to the executive establishes a new precedent in American government. This is precisely the concern Washington raised when he spoke of “encroachment” and limiting power within “constitutional spheres.”TRUMP NEEDS A TRANSFER, MAY HAVE TO ROB PETER TO PAY PAULPolicymakers always have exercised a healthy tension between the legislative branch and the executive branch. But none other than Alexander Hamilton called for what he characterized as “energy” in the executive when writing Federalist #70, the precursor set of documents which helped form the Constitution.Hamilton demanded an active executive to curb legislative overreaches and to pose as a bulwark against Congress. In this instance, Trump asserts there’s an emergency at the border. So he needs the wall. Maybe. Maybe not. But this is why the founders formed a system of checks and balances. There’s a question about just how much latitude the president has when it comes to repurposing funds Congress designated for something else. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power of the purse. All presidents can do is either sign or veto bills after lawmakers decide to spend money. Trump’s plan to rejigger billions of dollars of already appropriated spending by Congress could be a problem.Presidents long have tested the parameters of executive authority. President Woodrow Wilson declared a “national emergency” in 1917 because of an “insufficiency of maritime tonnage” to carry U.S. agricultural and manufacturing commodities. Congress approved the National Emergencies Act of 1976, granting presidents the ability to act on any number of priorities they may deem an emergency. Presidents have declared 58 national emergencies since 1976. Thirty-one are renewed each year.From a parliamentary perspective, Fox News is told that the National Emergencies Act is a legislative mess. It lacks focus, specificity and is inherently vague.“It is not the gold standard for writing legislation,” confided one source.That said, Congress can terminate declarations of national emergencies with the adoption of a joint resolution by both bodies of Congress. It needs a simple majority and must earn a presidential signature. If the president vetoes a House/Senate joint resolution, those bodies can move to override the veto with a two-thirds vote.The House likely would seek action to revoke the national emergency as it pertains to the wall. But this process is far thornier in the Senate. The statute contains imprecise verbiage as to how the Senate may consider the legislation and whether certain, special procedural motions fly in the face of debating the statute. For instance, the law requires the Senate to vote on overturning the national emergency after “three days.” But what constitutes “three days?” Three full days of debate? A motion to adjourn is one of the most-privileged motions in the Senate.

Addiction and mental illness pose a particularly acute problem in jails.By Steve CollFebruary 25, 2019The Pueblo County, Colorado, Sheriff’s Office. Addiction and mental illness pose a particularly acute problem in jails.As a child growing up in Pueblo, Colorado, Jeremy Laintz travelled widely with his father, an aeronautics engineer at Lockheed Martin, who sometimes took his four kids along on business trips. Family vacations included tours of aerospace facilities and, on one occasion, a trip to watch a space-shuttle launch at Cape Canaveral. Laintz’s mother managed a bakery, and Laintz, the youngest child in the family, recalled enjoying a warm home life. He played soccer and football, and spent summers hunting and fishing on a ranch that his family owned in North Dakota. As a teen-ager, though, he slipped into trouble—he was arrested first for driving under the influence, and then, in his late teens, for felony car theft. He spent a year in prison, where he learned to weld, and a few more years in halfway houses. Then, in 2003, he moved to Alaska, where he joined a Christian fellowship and took seasonal jobs welding, repairing roofs, and working in a fish-processing plant. He often made good money, and his life seemed back on track.Six years later, though, when he was thirty, he returned to Colorado and, while working in a warehouse, tore a tendon in his wrist. A doctor prescribed opioids for the pain, and Laintz immediately started abusing them. Then a friend persuaded him to try heroin, and soon he was addicted. He was arrested on a charge of possession and, while out on bond, in early October of 2016, failed to show up for a court-ordered drug test. He was arrested again and booked into the Pueblo County jail.As part of the standard booking procedure, medical personnel at the jail evaluated him. Pueblo County had a contract with Correctional Health Partners, a doctor-owned, for-profit company based in Denver, to provide health services; there was a medical facility on site, supplied with basic equipment. Laintz told company nurses on duty that he used heroin and suffered from hepatitis C, an affliction common among intravenous drug users. Correctional Health staff prescribed loperamide (for diarrhea) and meclizine (for nausea and vomiting) to ease his withdrawal while he awaited sentencing, a lawyer representing Laintz said.A week later, though, according to filings in a recent lawsuit, Laintz submitted a written request for medical help, noting that he was experiencing a level of pain “so bad I don’t know what is going on,” and that he could “hardly breathe” and “hardly move.” A Correctional Health E.M.T. gave him over-the-counter medication for “possible chest pain or anxiety/panic attack.” On October 15th, a Saturday, when his mother visited, Laintz complained to her, too, of severe pain. The following Thursday, he was sentenced to ninety days in jail. When his mother returned, a week later, he told her that he was still in “rough shape,” so she called the Correctional Health unit. His father also went to speak to the county sheriff, who oversaw the jail.A physician’s assistant examined Laintz again, and found that he had low blood pressure and an elevated pulse. According to court documents, she told him to try “relaxation and breath control.” After he told deputies that he was too weak to walk to the dining hall, they allowed other inmates to bring him food in his cell. On November 1st, an administrator at Correctional Health left a voice-mail message for Laintz’s mother reporting that, according to the medical staff, “everything is pretty much normal.” He suggested that Laintz had been deliberately hyperventilating to produce his symptoms, in an attempt to be sent to the hospital. “There is no medical reason for him to go,” the administrator said, and asked her to tell her son “to quit hyperventilating and to coöperate with us.”That evening, however, a sheriff’s deputy noticed that Laintz looked pale and was having difficulty breathing. The deputy declared an emergency, but, rather than send him to a hospital, a Correctional Health physician’s assistant ordered treatment with intravenous fluids in the jail’s medical facility. When Laintz insisted on being taken to the hospital, a sergeant at the jail overruled the assistant and sent Laintz in a police car to the St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center. There, according to his lawyer, doctors diagnosed dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and acute renal and respiratory failure. They put him in a medically induced coma and intubated him, then had him airlifted to a hospital near Denver, where he spent a month undergoing multiple procedures, including the partial removal of a lung. He also lost part of six toes to gangrene.Laintz is suing the county and Correctional Health Partners for “deliberately indifferent policies.” The county declined to comment on pending litigation. In a court filing on February 12th, Correctional Health disputed Laintz’s account, saying that “at no time” did its personnel fail to “address and treat his medical needs.” Madison Barr, a spokeswoman for the company, had previously told me that she also could not comment on the lawsuit, but she pointed out that increasing numbers of people are entering jails with medical problems related to chronic conditions, such as addiction, and that, at the time of their booking, “these conditions don’t necessarily show symptoms.”There are more than three thousand jails in the United States, usually run by sheriffs and county offices, which house some seven hundred thousand people. They are typically waiting to make bail—or, if they can’t, to go to trial or enter a plea—or are serving short sentences. Barr is right about the crisis of chronic health conditions among them. According to a study released in 2017 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly half the people held in jails suffer from some kind of mental illness, and more than a quarter have a severe condition, such as bipolar disorder. The same year, the bureau reported that about two-thirds of sentenced jail inmates suffer from drug addiction or dependency; that number was based on data from 2007-09, so it does not take into account the recent catastrophic rise of opioid addiction. That epidemic and other public-health emergencies, in jails across the country, are being aggravated by failings in the criminal-justice system.Jails have a much higher turnover rate than prisons, where inmates generally serve long sentences. Prison wardens face their own problems, serving populations that suffer from chronic diseases and conditions related to aging, in addition to high rates of addiction and mental illness. Yet the crisis is particularly acute in jails, because large numbers of people booked into custody are in a state of distress or, like Laintz, will suffer withdrawal, which can require close monitoring and specialized treatment that jail wardens are not equipped to provide. Many jails are in rural or poor counties, where administrators complain that they have neither the resources nor the expertise to hire, train, and supervise doctors and nurses in the particular demands that their facilities require. Increasingly, they have turned to for-profit companies operating in the field known as “correctional health care,” which pledge to deliver quality care while containing costs.The growth of for-profit firms providing medical services to the incarcerated is part of a trend that started in the nineteen-eighties, during the Reagan Administration, toward privatization in the general management of correctional facilities. The trend accelerated after the passage of tough sentencing laws in the nineties—notably the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994—which caused the number of people held in jails and prisons to jump from about three hundred thousand, in 1980, to more than two million today. More than a third of that population is African-American. According to a 2018 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than half the states hire private companies to provide at least some of their prison health care. There are no comprehensive statistics about the prevalence of private health-care companies in jails. But, according to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which accredits programs in correctional facilities around the country, about seventy per cent of the jails that it inspects outsource their medical services, and for-profit companies have a sizable share of those contracts.People held in correctional facilities are entitled to a judicially mandated standard of care, but no large-scale studies have been conducted to compare the quality of treatment provided by private companies with that provided by government-run services. The evidence available from lawsuits filed against the companies is troubling, however. With the help of Gabrialle Landsverk and Alejandra Ibarra Chaoul, postgraduate researchers at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, I reviewed complaints, depositions, and affidavits in lawsuits filed against jail operators and correctional-health-care companies.We focussed on two of the largest nationwide providers, Corizon Health, which is based in Brentwood, Tennessee, and Wellpath, which is headquartered in Nashville. The two companies have been sued about fifteen hundred times during the past five years—according to the federal and state court records that we collected—over matters including alleged neglect, malpractice, and, in dozens of cases, wrongful injury or death. (Corizon was the defendant in more than a thousand of the cases.) Most of the suits were filed pro se, or without the help of a lawyer; petitioners had legal counsel in only about a quarter of them. More than a hundred ended in settlements, but, owing to confidentiality agreements, it is often not clear whether the company or the local government made a payment, or, if so, for how much.Corizon reports that it is responsible for the care of about a hundred and eighty thousand people on a day-to-day basis. Wellpath, which until last November was known as Correct Care Solutions (the company changed its name after merging with a competitor), says that it is responsible for about two hundred and fifty thousand people on any given day. Executives from both companies told me that the lawsuits shouldn’t be seen as indicative of over-all problems with how they treat patients. Many cases involve flimsy or inconclusive evidence and don’t result in findings of liability. Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a prison-health-care consultant based in San Francisco, who advises state and local governments on providing medical services to prisoners, said that, for the companies, managing suits alleging poor treatment is “just a cost of doing business in this industry.”Patrick Cummiskey, Wellpath’s chief strategy officer, told me that the company is concerned, above all, with maintaining good health among inmates, and that it believes that providing quality care will reduce its financial risks in the long run. He also pointed out that Wellpath routinely indemnifies state and local governments from all legal costs in cases involving alleged medical mistakes. “We bear the risk of malpractice,” he said, so “we’re incentivized to provide quality care.”In some states, though, public-interest lawyers have brought class-action suits alleging inadequate health care against the entire system. In Arizona, civil-rights groups filed a class-action suit in 2012. A year later, after the state passed legislation privatizing prison health care, it signed a contract with Corizon to provide medical services in its prisons. In 2015, a federal district court, seeking to resolve the suit, approved a settlement in which the state pledged to overhaul care. But, last June, Judge David Duncan found that “widespread and systemic failures remain,” and held the state in contempt, issuing it fines of more than a million dollars. Martha Harbin, who has served as Corizon’s director of external relations, said in an e-mail that the company does “not agree with the judge’s description” of its performance in Arizona. Last month, the state, which has also disputed the judge’s finding, announced that, as of July, it is awarding the contract to another company.In December, in a case in which a federal judge is supervising a settlement designed to improve medical services at Baltimore’s city jail, the State of Maryland, which oversees the facility, said in court documents that Wexford Health Sources, the company it hired to provide the services, had failed to respond to directions to improve its performance. It had allegedly provided “unreliable” reports, and operated while “critically short of care providers and clerical staff,” leaving “key clinical and leadership positions vacant for lengthy periods.” Wexford lost the contract, though it is not a party to the litigation, and a spokesperson for the company said that it and the state “had a difference in opinion” about how to best provide health care to inmates.Taken as a whole, evidence from cases across the country suggests that four decades of policy failures in both health-care and criminal-justice reform have left a largely neglected population vulnerable and, at times, at risk, and that for-profit companies, which were promoted as a solution, have instead become an integral part of a troubled system.The standard of care that incarcerated people have a right to receive was established in the landmark case of Estelle v. Gamble, in 1976. J. W. Gamble was an inmate in the Huntsville Unit of the Texas prison system. On November 9, 1973, a six-hundred-pound bale of cotton fell on him while he was on work assignment in a textile mill. He complained repeatedly of severe back pain, and prison doctors gave him pain relievers, but they did not take any X-rays. After refusing to work, he was moved to solitary confinement. He filed a pro-se lawsuit, in the form of a twenty-four-page handwritten complaint, objecting to the quality of medical care he had received.A federal judge dismissed the suit, but Gamble appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which appointed Daniel K. Hedges, a corporate litigator in Houston, to represent him. Hedges never met his client, but he argued that Gamble’s treatment was unconstitutional, because of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, where Hedges again argued it. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for an eight-to-one majority, found that “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” was indeed inconsistent with Eighth Amendment guarantees, and ordered that Gamble’s care be reëvaluated.Gamble himself did not benefit from the ruling: after his case was returned to the Fifth Circuit, the appellate court found that his care had not been sufficiently poor to justify compensation. (A few years later, he was killed by a fellow-prisoner.) Still, practitioners of prison medicine today like to point out that, thanks to Gamble’s suit and Marshall’s opinion, the incarcerated are the only people in America with a constitutional right to health care.The Estelle decision was handed down just as the American Medical Association was leading a drive to reform health care for the incarcerated. It conducted a survey of conditions in hundreds of jails, in which operators reported dilapidated and ill-equipped facilities. Many lacked emergency medical equipment. Some didn’t even have first-aid kits. The standard of care set by Estelle was modest, calling only for an absence of “deliberate indifference.” But, building on the decision, the A.M.A. sought to establish uniform standards, which, in turn, led to the creation, in 1983, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.Estelle also spawned a wave of civil-rights litigation seeking to enforce the Eighth Amendment protection; this gradually led to improvements in the judiciary’s definition of a required standard. Today, prisoners are typically entitled to what a judge for the First Circuit Court of Appeals defined, in 1987, as “adequate” care at a level “reasonably commensurate with modern medical science.” (The irony remains that inmates’ rights to health care have expanded, while citizens on the outside still have no universal right to care.)Litigation, though, is not always the best way to improve public policy. David Cloud, who works on prison-health-care issues for the Vera Institute, a nonprofit research group that focusses on criminal justice, told me, “I definitely don’t want to discount the importance of litigation, because it’s so critical.” Still, he added, correctional health care is more than an arena that requires legal accountability when failures occur. Its troubles affect many people beyond those who are incarcerated. Jails may hire private companies in the interest of saving taxpayer dollars. But, if people suffering from addiction or chronic illness are released back into communities without having received adequate treatment, “they’re still going to draw on taxpayers—just somewhere else.”Companies that contract to provide health care to the incarcerated are tapping into an enormous business opportunity—annual spending now exceeds ten billion dollars—and they are obligated to their owners to seek profit. David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project, at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me that companies therefore have compelling incentives to cut costs and staff, which can result in “denying care in what is literally a captive market.” He added, “I don’t mean to suggest that government-run prison health care is perfect. It’s often appallingly deficient. But, at least when a government is providing the service, there is some measure of oversight. There is some measure of democratic control.” Apart from the court-enforced standards that have evolved since Estelle, “you don’t have that with the private companies.”Day to day, correctional-care companies treat people on site for complaints like headaches and minor injuries. Nurses wheel carts through cellblocks to dispense over-the-counter and prescription medications; people who are sick can either call out for help or submit written requests. Nurses, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and administrators typically staff jail infirmaries around the clock. In larger, urban jails, doctors, psychiatrists, and social workers may also work on site. In rural counties, they appear perhaps once or twice a week for consultations. When no doctor is present, one is usually on call to consult by telephone in emergencies. In situations requiring surgery or other complex procedures, correctional-care companies are supposed to send patients to a hospital.The companies negotiate multiyear contracts with each jail and prison that they serve. Medical staff, prescription drugs, and outside services such as hospital stays constitute the major costs. Often, the companies receive a per-diem, per-individual rate, so profits depend on holding costs below that amount. Sometimes contracts include provisions that increase a company’s potential profit if it holds down transfers to hospitals or to other outside providers. Medicare and private health-insurance companies follow similar incentives to contain costs, prioritize preventive care, and avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. But a distinct feature of correctional health care is that, if incarcerated people believe that their health—or their life—is in jeopardy, they can’t just drive themselves to an emergency room. As Fathi put it, “Market forces don’t operate in the prison context for the reason that prisoners have absolutely no consumer choice.”The potential effects that contract incentives might have on health care have featured in a number of lawsuits in recent years. One case involved a forty-four-year-old man named Kenneth McGill, who was booked into the jail in Jefferson County, Colorado, after violating probation for a D.U.I. conviction. He had been there two months when, in September of 2012, he began to experience facial drooping and dizziness—symptoms, he thought, of a stroke. He and other inmates reported his symptoms to the deputies on duty and to a nurse with Correctional Healthcare Companies, which had a contract to provide medical services at the jail. (The company has no connection to Correctional Health Partners; in 2014, it was acquired by Correct Care Solutions, the company that became Wellpath.) According to court documents, company staff waited more than twelve hours before sending McGill to a hospital. Doctors there determined that he had had a stroke—he says that he still suffers from vertigo and from a loss of mobility in his right arm—and he sued the company.Anna Holland Edwards, one of McGill’s attorneys, told me that, at the trial, she and her colleagues pointed to a provision in Correctional Healthcare’s contract which stipulated that the company had to pay the first fifty thousand dollars in costs when an inmate went to the hospital. “There’s nothing wrong with being a for-profit company,” she said in her closing argument. “But the intersection of profit and health care has its problems.” She continued, “The company gets to decide whether the care is provided and know that they’re the ones that have to pay for it when it is.” (A spokesperson for the county later disputed that its contract with Correctional Healthcare discouraged hospitalization.) The jury awarded McGill eleven million dollars, including more than seven million in punitive damages against Correctional Healthcare. The parties then settled for an undisclosed amount.David Perry, Wellpath’s chief legal officer, said that Correctional Healthcare’s “way of doing things was different in some respects from ours.” But he also argued that provisions requiring companies to pay for off-site costs, though common, don’t encourage cost-cutting, because, if a company fails to provide quality services, “eventually your clients will hold you accountable for it.”Martha Harbin, of Corizon Health, told me that maximizing on-site care “respects the taxpayer dollars used to pay for correctional health care,” and reduces the risk of people escaping from hospitals. (Escapes from hospitals are, in fact, a recurring problem.) But, she said, “we don’t hesitate to send people off site if the evidence points to that need. If they have to go, they have to go.”Many of the nurses and doctors I spoke with who work in jails described their careers as a moral calling. They serve people on the margins of society: it is not unusual for them to encounter patients who haven’t visited a doctor in years. Ned Higgins, a psychiatrist in South Carolina who has worked on contract for Wellpath, told me that he finds working in county jails inspirational. “We’re helping the seriously mentally ill,” he said. “The vast majority of inmates, patients, that I see were off their medicine when they got arrested. I see our mission as to get them back on their medicine and get them off street drugs. I think we do that very well.” Specialists in the field agree. “People really are trying to provide high-quality health care, and jail environments are really tough,” Brent Gibson, a physician who is the chief health officer of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said. “Nobody wants a bad health-care outcome.”MORE FROM THIS ISSUEMarch 4, 2019Letter from the U.K.The Psychiatrist Who Believed People Could Tell the FutureBy Sam KnightThe TheatreStephen Sondheim and Lynn Nottage Revivals Time-Travel Through Artists’ LivesBy Sarah LarsonFeedback Dept.Is the Strand a Landmark?By Micah HauserShouts & MurmursCongratulations on Your New DebtBy Kate SidleyFiction“The Starlet Apartments”By Jonathan LethemGoings On About TownThe Temptations Get a Broadway Jukebox MusicalStill, a significant amount of the serious neglect documented in lawsuits arises from the fact that jails have become a primary provider of medical care for the severely mentally ill. Rhonda Levand was confronted with the sometimes harsh consequences of that reality in the case of her daughter, Raynbow Gignilliat. In 1992, when Gignilliat was seventeen and in her junior year of high school, in Marietta, Georgia, she was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Eventually, she graduated from college, got married, had three sons, and worked as a paralegal, a substitute teacher, and a freelance writer. She didn’t always take her medications, Levand told me, and “every year she would go through a little cycle where she was a little bit manic.” But then she would right herself.In 2013, Gignilliat and her husband divorced, which seemed to trigger a new crisis for her and led to a number of short hospital stays. Levand by then was living near Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she now works as a paraprofessional special-education teacher and a receptionist. That October, she invited her daughter to stay with her. Gignilliat had never been violent with her before, Levand said, but on October 27th she started “pushing and shoving” her, and upending furniture and breaking things in the house. Levand called the police, and Gignilliat was arrested for aggravated battery and property damage, and was taken to the Sandoval County Detention Center.The health services at the jail were provided by Correctional Healthcare, the company that was later acquired by Wellpath. Medical staff noted that Gignilliat had mental-health needs, but she refused to take medication. “If they don’t consent to take the medicine, they don’t force them,” Levand told me. In fact, neither the company nor the jail had legal authority to do so; in New Mexico, such action requires state-court approval. Medical or jail staff could have petitioned a judge to name a “treatment guardian” for Gignilliat, but did not. Levand could have petitioned, too, but says she didn’t know that this was an option.After a social worker referred Gignilliat to a physician’s assistant for psychiatric evaluation, corrections officers placed her in a segregated cell, according to a legal complaint. She was allowed to leave it only to take a shower or to consult with a social worker or with medical staff; some days, she refused a shower and did not leave her cell at all. By mid-December, she had become deeply delusional, and the warden finally transferred her to the emergency room at the University of New Mexico Hospital. A doctor there diagnosed bipolar disorder and psychosis, treated her with anti-anxiety medication, and persuaded her to eat—according to Levand, she had lost about twenty pounds. She was then sent back to jail, where she again went unmedicated.Two weeks later, Gignilliat was transferred to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute. Staff there obtained a court-appointed treatment guardianship, and, in late January of 2014, she was administered medication, and her condition stabilized. At the end of March, the district attorney dropped the criminal charges against her, and she went back to Georgia. Photographs taken there show her smiling as she embraces her children. Yet, on June 12th, she swallowed a fatal dose of pills; she died two days later, at the age of thirty-nine.The next month, Levand filed suit on behalf of Gignilliat’s children. Sandoval County and Wellpath, which inherited the liabilities in the case from Correctional Healthcare, said that, since Gignilliat’s suicide took place more than two months after she was released, they bore no responsibility. However, court papers filed by Levand describe starkly the daily suffering that her daughter endured while in segregation. Ultimately, the county and the company agreed to a confidential financial settlement. David Perry said that Wellpath rarely pursues jury trials, because “it is very expensive to litigate cases, notwithstanding how justified you believe your position to be.”The situation that Gignilliat encountered is not uncommon: few local jails have dedicated mental-health facilities, and operators often resort to managing people by placing them in segregation. Yet even in jails that do provide dedicated care the quality can be poor. In the summer of 2013, Bradley Ballard was detained in New York City’s jail on Rikers Island for a parole violation. He was thirty-nine years old and suffered from diabetes, but he had previously received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and was assigned to the mental-health unit. Under a contract signed with the city in 2001, Corizon Health shared responsibility for medical services at Rikers and oversaw the mental-health facility.In September, according to a legal complaint, Ballard was moved to solitary confinement, after dancing provocatively in front of a female corrections officer. For six days, medical personnel and jail guards looked in on him, but did not offer him any assistance. He was then discovered lying naked and covered in his own waste. He had mutilated his genitals, and died hours after being found, from sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis.In 2014, civil-rights lawyers filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ballard’s mother and his estate. The New York State Commission of Correction, in reviewing the case, said that the performance of the company and of the city’s Department of Corrections was so “incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.” The city paid nearly six million dollars, reportedly the largest settlement involving the death of an inmate in the city’s custody. (Corizon did not contribute any of the funds, because, according to Martha Harbin, the contract stipulated that the city would bear financial responsibility for all malpractice claims.) Corizon’s contract expired at the end of 2015, and it was not renewed. A group of New York-based nonprofit health-care providers has since taken over the provision of medical services at Rikers. The Department of Corrections Commissioner, Cynthia Brann, said in a statement that, with the new arrangement, the city has “taken major steps to overhaul the delivery of healthcare in our jails.”Both jail operators and private health-care companies recognize that it would be better to treat mentally ill people, especially those who are nonviolent, in specialized hospitals or in dedicated units in jails. But building those facilities and hiring counsellors and psychiatrists to staff them requires government funding that many operators don’t have. There are “never enough beds” to accommodate such cases, Patrick Cummiskey, of Wellpath, told me. Jails are “absolutely the wrong place” to treat mental illness, he said, yet they “have become the largest mental-health provider in most communities.” David Perry said that Wellpath no longer bids on contracts in counties where there is a “disproportionate number of mental-health cases” and inadequate local resources to handle them. “We don’t get involved,” he said. “You’re just setting yourself up for this problem.” Poor care for mentally ill prisoners, he added, reflects taxpayers’ unwillingness to fund dedicated facilities and programs, not “our company’s quality.”Opioid addiction, too, is an area in which jail health care is increasingly relied on by default. Last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than seventy-two thousand people died from overdoses—almost two hundred people a day. The C.D.C. has also reported that overdoses now constitute the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of fifty. And many people suffering from addiction pass through jails on charges related to their habit.Madaline Pitkin was one of them. She grew up in Portland, Oregon, and attended Catholic school, where she was a good student. She was “very spirited,” her father, Russell Pitkin, told me. “She was always into competition and sports and was always trying to improve herself.” She enrolled at the University of Oregon, but wasn’t happy there, so she switched, for a time, to Portland Community College. According to the Oregonian, which ran a series of articles on her case, she sometimes paid her bills by working as a barista or, at Christmas, as one of Santa’s elves.At some point in her twenties, she drifted into heroin addiction, and, in April of 2014, she was arrested on a warrant for an earlier arrest and for possession. During her booking at the Washington County jail, which, until May of 2015, had a contract with Corizon Health, she told a nurse that she used a gram of heroin a day. A week later, at the age of twenty-six, she died of dehydration, after vomiting and suffering diarrhea as she went through withdrawal. Company personnel allegedly failed to provide an I.V. to keep her hydrated, and did not respond adequately to her four handwritten pleas for help. In her final request, on April 23rd, she wrote, “I haven’t been able to keep food, liquids, meds down in six days. I feel like I am very close to death. . . . Please help me.”Last December, a federal judge approved a ten-million-dollar judgment against Corizon and Washington County for Pitkin’s family, the largest known amount that the company has been ordered to pay. (Corizon had fully indemnified the county.) Steve Rector, who became Corizon’s C.E.O. last year, said in a statement, “The lessons we’ve learned from this case have been catalysts for significant changes we have made and are still making to our clinical program.” The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said that Pitkin’s death was a “tragedy,” and that it has reformed health care at the jail, with a new private company.Nancy Fishman, a criminal-justice policy expert at the Vera Institute, told me that “every sort of convocation of sheriffs or jail administrators or law enforcement” these days is consumed by the opioid crisis and its impact on jail health care. She added, “There’s just a sort of general sense that we’re being overwhelmed, and we don’t know what to do.” Brent Gibson, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said that “not everyone accepts that substance abuse is a chronic disease.” Some jails treat addiction as a “moral problem,” and treat opioid withdrawal only with drugs that alleviate its symptoms.In other jurisdictions, sheriffs and administrators do follow the recommendations of public-health advocates who argue that the best way to defeat addiction is to guide people toward long-term treatment, with access to methadone or to similar drugs that can allow them to either safely maintain their opioid use or gradually reduce and cease it. The National Commission recommends that prisons and jails adopt a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medications to ease withdrawal and others, such as buprenorphine, that safely satisfy cravings for drugs.The commission also advises psychological counselling and in-detention meetings with recovery groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous. But the resources to support such public-health approaches are small in comparison with the vast sums spent on jails and prisons themselves. David Cloud, of the Vera Institute, said that many rural and poor counties “don’t even have medications or treatment providers in the community” to address opioid addiction, let alone in their jails.On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, then the Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, released a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to begin “the process of reducing—and ultimately ending—our use of privately operated prisons.” The memorandum did not address for-profit correctional-health-care companies directly, but it was the boldest turn away from the country’s partially privatized incarceration system in decades. The Presidential election was less than three months away, and Hillary Clinton, who was then leading Donald Trump comfortably in most polls, tweeted her support, suggesting that the order would stand if she won the White House. The share prices of the country’s two largest private-prison builders and operators, GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America (since renamed CoreCivic), fell by nearly forty per cent in a single day. After Trump was inaugurated, one of the first acts of his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, was to rescind the Yates order. (After the election, according to the Washington Post, GEO hired two people who had worked in Sessions’s Senate office to lobby for the company’s interests.)Opponents of privatized detention have argued, on philosophical and constitutional grounds, that certain governmental powers—such as those to wage war, to use lethal force in the name of the law, and to hold people in detention—should not be hired out to profit-seekers. Yates’s decision was made on a more pragmatic basis: drawing on the findings of a study produced earlier that August by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, she asserted that the government is better at running prisons than corporations are. Private companies, she wrote, “simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs,” and “they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.”The concurrent rise of for-profit health care in jails and prisons has not been accompanied by the kind of public debate, congressional scrutiny, or scholarly research that has informed other fields of health policy. Yet there are notable public and nonprofit alternatives. In some European Union countries, where universal access to health care is fully established, prison and jail health care is often administered by state health services. In the Netherlands, for example, a specialized public service treats prisoners on the basis of an “equivalence principle,” meaning that the care provided should be the same as if they were free citizens.In this country, some physicians and health-care specialists advocate for greater investment in community treatment centers—residential and nonresidential facilities that seek to treat and stabilize individuals suffering from addiction or mental illness through medication, peer counselling, and social services, and where nonviolent offenders suffering from these conditions might be directed, as an alternative to jail. Other practitioners argue that prison health services in the United States work best when they are provided by nonprofits that also deliver medical services for the general population (as is now the case in New York City). Since the late nineteen-eighties, four states—Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, and Connecticut—have contracted prison medical services to their state university systems, whose facilities also serve the public.Newton Kendig, a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., has spent most of his career overseeing health care in prisons. He told me that contracting with public universities has advantages—for example, specialists on a medical-school faculty can consult on prisoners’ cases. The University of Texas has pioneered the use of telemedicine, or videoconferencing, to treat the incarcerated. But the university model hasn’t always succeeded. Last July, after a woman gave birth in her cell at the York Correctional Institution, in Niantic, Connecticut, where health care was overseen by the University of Connecticut, and where there had been other complaints about care, officials transferred responsibility for prisoner health care statewide back to the state corrections agency.I met Kendig last summer in his office at George Washington’s medical school, where he is currently leading an initiative to draw on academic medical expertise to improve health care for inmates. Now in his early sixties, he told me that he had chosen to practice in correctional health because he “wanted to care for at-risk populations.” He served as the director of medicine for Maryland’s correctional facilities, and then, in 1996, he joined the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is overseen by the Surgeon General. After twenty years of service, he retired as a rear admiral and an Assistant Surgeon General.The Commissioned Corps is another public model that might be adapted to provide an alternative to privatization. It is a uniformed medical civil service of more than six thousand physicians, public-health specialists, and other professionals. Among other duties, members design and manage medical and mental-health programs for federal prisoners. They also work for the C.D.C., to monitor and respond to epidemics, and provide medical expertise during emergencies, such as hurricanes.Kendig told me that the corps’s public-service mission, the opportunity it provides to work for diverse federal agencies, and its generous government pensions have helped it to recruit and retain talented personnel devoted to prison health care, which is, as he put it, a “highly structured and paramilitary environment” that requires a “special person” to embrace it for a career. “The advantage of the public model is that public service gives you stability,” he continued. “The turnover in the private sector is very high.” However, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have proved hostile to expansions of publicly funded medical services. Last year, the Administration, as part of its drive to reduce nonmilitary federal spending, proposed cutting the corps’s budget by forty per cent.There are, nevertheless, signs that the country is moving toward a new consensus on criminal-justice reform. That includes support within the Republican Party for public policies that may improve medical services for the incarcerated. A major advancement in the field was reached in May of last year, when the Texas state legislature passed the Sandra Bland Act.On July 10, 2015, Bland, a twenty-eight-year-old African-American woman, was stopped in her car by a police officer in Waller County, northwest of Houston, for failing to signal a lane change. In an encounter captured by the officer’s dashboard camera, Bland argued with him, and he escalated the confrontation, finally pulling out a Taser and shouting, “I will light you up!” He arrested her and booked her into the county jail. During her processing, Bland said that she had attempted suicide earlier that year, following a miscarriage. Three days later, she hanged herself in her cell.A grand jury indicted the officer on a perjury charge, but prosecutors dropped it in exchange for his agreement to never again work as a policeman. Bland’s family reached a settlement with the county, which reportedly paid close to two million dollars. The law enacted in her name requires authorities to make a “good-faith effort” to divert anyone who is arrested and is suffering from acute mental illness or addiction away from jail and into treatment, particularly if the illness or addiction is related to the reason that the person was arrested. The “good-faith” standard for sheriffs and jail operators is a soft one, but lawmakers have created incentives for judges to grant bail to the afflicted, and have provided ninety-two million dollars in new funding for mental-health services and monitoring of people judged to be suicide risks.The Bland Act was introduced by Democrats, but, after some police-reform measures were removed, it passed unanimously in the Republican-led legislature, and was signed by Governor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican. That bipartisan support reinforced what I heard from sheriffs and jail-health specialists elsewhere: that the effort to address the unnecessary suffering and loss of life caused by inadequate mental-health and addiction treatment must transcend the current polarization of national politics. Health care isn’t the only sector of criminal-justice reform in which cross-party coalitions have formed. In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act, which passed in the Senate in a vote of eighty-seven to twelve, and which the House of Representatives approved in a vote of three hundred and sixty to fifty-nine. Among other things, the law is intended to reduce the nation’s incarceration rates by lowering mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.Kenneth L. Favier, a theologian and a public-health specialist, argues in his 2017 book, “Humane Health Care for Prisoners,” that a “radical revision” of the criminal-justice and mental-health systems is needed, to transfer “large numbers” of people suffering from mental illness “into community treatment settings as well as prevent such persons from being arrested and incarcerated in the first place.”Historically, sweeping changes in civil rights have occurred only after a moral awakening among at least a vocal minority of the public. So far, the articulation of a better ethic of prison medicine is mostly consigned to a small body of specialized literature, including Favier’s book. His core principle succinctly echoes European policies and standards, as well as the standards advocated in civil-rights lawsuits since Estelle v. Gamble. He writes that, except for “understandable and acceptable” constraints required for the administration of safe custody, “it should not matter that one is a prisoner.”The powerlessness of prisoners makes that a difficult standard to attain, as Jeremy Laintz discovered in Pueblo County. After his hospitalization and surgeries, he entered an in-patient rehabilitation facility in Denver, to learn how to walk again and to strengthen his damaged lung. When he got out, in April of 2017, six months had passed since he was first sentenced to serve three months in jail. He moved in with his parents, started taking buprenorphine, and volunteered for a time at a local needle exchange. Laintz is now forty, and, when I spoke to him on the phone recently, he told me that he is unable to walk for ten minutes without needing to sit down. He is not working.He had done time before, and he understood that, when he went to jail, he would lose many of the rights that are taken for granted by people on the outside. Yet he had always trusted that, if he ever found himself in need of urgent help, he would be taken seriously. On this occasion, he said, “they treated me the whole time like I was lying to them.” But he also felt fortunate: his parents believed him when he said that he was in pain, and they pushed to get him help. Other people have no such advocates. “I know there are people dying,” Laintz said. “I was almost one of them.” ♦Steve Coll, a staff writer, is the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.

Addiction and mental illness pose a particularly acute problem in jails.By Steve CollFebruary 25, 2019The Pueblo County, Colorado, Sheriff’s Office. Addiction and mental illness pose a particularly acute problem in jails.As a child growing up in Pueblo, Colorado, Jeremy Laintz travelled widely with his father, an aeronautics engineer at Lockheed Martin, who sometimes took his four kids along on business trips. Family vacations included tours of aerospace facilities and, on one occasion, a trip to watch a space-shuttle launch at Cape Canaveral. Laintz’s mother managed a bakery, and Laintz, the youngest child in the family, recalled enjoying a warm home life. He played soccer and football, and spent summers hunting and fishing on a ranch that his family owned in North Dakota. As a teen-ager, though, he slipped into trouble—he was arrested first for driving under the influence, and then, in his late teens, for felony car theft. He spent a year in prison, where he learned to weld, and a few more years in halfway houses. Then, in 2003, he moved to Alaska, where he joined a Christian fellowship and took seasonal jobs welding, repairing roofs, and working in a fish-processing plant. He often made good money, and his life seemed back on track.Six years later, though, when he was thirty, he returned to Colorado and, while working in a warehouse, tore a tendon in his wrist. A doctor prescribed opioids for the pain, and Laintz immediately started abusing them. Then a friend persuaded him to try heroin, and soon he was addicted. He was arrested on a charge of possession and, while out on bond, in early October of 2016, failed to show up for a court-ordered drug test. He was arrested again and booked into the Pueblo County jail.As part of the standard booking procedure, medical personnel at the jail evaluated him. Pueblo County had a contract with Correctional Health Partners, a doctor-owned, for-profit company based in Denver, to provide health services; there was a medical facility on site, supplied with basic equipment. Laintz told company nurses on duty that he used heroin and suffered from hepatitis C, an affliction common among intravenous drug users. Correctional Health staff prescribed loperamide (for diarrhea) and meclizine (for nausea and vomiting) to ease his withdrawal while he awaited sentencing, a lawyer representing Laintz said.A week later, though, according to filings in a recent lawsuit, Laintz submitted a written request for medical help, noting that he was experiencing a level of pain “so bad I don’t know what is going on,” and that he could “hardly breathe” and “hardly move.” A Correctional Health E.M.T. gave him over-the-counter medication for “possible chest pain or anxiety/panic attack.” On October 15th, a Saturday, when his mother visited, Laintz complained to her, too, of severe pain. The following Thursday, he was sentenced to ninety days in jail. When his mother returned, a week later, he told her that he was still in “rough shape,” so she called the Correctional Health unit. His father also went to speak to the county sheriff, who oversaw the jail.A physician’s assistant examined Laintz again, and found that he had low blood pressure and an elevated pulse. According to court documents, she told him to try “relaxation and breath control.” After he told deputies that he was too weak to walk to the dining hall, they allowed other inmates to bring him food in his cell. On November 1st, an administrator at Correctional Health left a voice-mail message for Laintz’s mother reporting that, according to the medical staff, “everything is pretty much normal.” He suggested that Laintz had been deliberately hyperventilating to produce his symptoms, in an attempt to be sent to the hospital. “There is no medical reason for him to go,” the administrator said, and asked her to tell her son “to quit hyperventilating and to coöperate with us.”That evening, however, a sheriff’s deputy noticed that Laintz looked pale and was having difficulty breathing. The deputy declared an emergency, but, rather than send him to a hospital, a Correctional Health physician’s assistant ordered treatment with intravenous fluids in the jail’s medical facility. When Laintz insisted on being taken to the hospital, a sergeant at the jail overruled the assistant and sent Laintz in a police car to the St. Mary-Corwin Medical Center. There, according to his lawyer, doctors diagnosed dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia, and acute renal and respiratory failure. They put him in a medically induced coma and intubated him, then had him airlifted to a hospital near Denver, where he spent a month undergoing multiple procedures, including the partial removal of a lung. He also lost part of six toes to gangrene.Laintz is suing the county and Correctional Health Partners for “deliberately indifferent policies.” The county declined to comment on pending litigation. In a court filing on February 12th, Correctional Health disputed Laintz’s account, saying that “at no time” did its personnel fail to “address and treat his medical needs.” Madison Barr, a spokeswoman for the company, had previously told me that she also could not comment on the lawsuit, but she pointed out that increasing numbers of people are entering jails with medical problems related to chronic conditions, such as addiction, and that, at the time of their booking, “these conditions don’t necessarily show symptoms.”There are more than three thousand jails in the United States, usually run by sheriffs and county offices, which house some seven hundred thousand people. They are typically waiting to make bail—or, if they can’t, to go to trial or enter a plea—or are serving short sentences. Barr is right about the crisis of chronic health conditions among them. According to a study released in 2017 by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly half the people held in jails suffer from some kind of mental illness, and more than a quarter have a severe condition, such as bipolar disorder. The same year, the bureau reported that about two-thirds of sentenced jail inmates suffer from drug addiction or dependency; that number was based on data from 2007-09, so it does not take into account the recent catastrophic rise of opioid addiction. That epidemic and other public-health emergencies, in jails across the country, are being aggravated by failings in the criminal-justice system.Jails have a much higher turnover rate than prisons, where inmates generally serve long sentences. Prison wardens face their own problems, serving populations that suffer from chronic diseases and conditions related to aging, in addition to high rates of addiction and mental illness. Yet the crisis is particularly acute in jails, because large numbers of people booked into custody are in a state of distress or, like Laintz, will suffer withdrawal, which can require close monitoring and specialized treatment that jail wardens are not equipped to provide. Many jails are in rural or poor counties, where administrators complain that they have neither the resources nor the expertise to hire, train, and supervise doctors and nurses in the particular demands that their facilities require. Increasingly, they have turned to for-profit companies operating in the field known as “correctional health care,” which pledge to deliver quality care while containing costs.The growth of for-profit firms providing medical services to the incarcerated is part of a trend that started in the nineteen-eighties, during the Reagan Administration, toward privatization in the general management of correctional facilities. The trend accelerated after the passage of tough sentencing laws in the nineties—notably the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994—which caused the number of people held in jails and prisons to jump from about three hundred thousand, in 1980, to more than two million today. More than a third of that population is African-American. According to a 2018 study from the Pew Charitable Trusts, more than half the states hire private companies to provide at least some of their prison health care. There are no comprehensive statistics about the prevalence of private health-care companies in jails. But, according to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which accredits programs in correctional facilities around the country, about seventy per cent of the jails that it inspects outsource their medical services, and for-profit companies have a sizable share of those contracts.People held in correctional facilities are entitled to a judicially mandated standard of care, but no large-scale studies have been conducted to compare the quality of treatment provided by private companies with that provided by government-run services. The evidence available from lawsuits filed against the companies is troubling, however. With the help of Gabrialle Landsverk and Alejandra Ibarra Chaoul, postgraduate researchers at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism, I reviewed complaints, depositions, and affidavits in lawsuits filed against jail operators and correctional-health-care companies.We focussed on two of the largest nationwide providers, Corizon Health, which is based in Brentwood, Tennessee, and Wellpath, which is headquartered in Nashville. The two companies have been sued about fifteen hundred times during the past five years—according to the federal and state court records that we collected—over matters including alleged neglect, malpractice, and, in dozens of cases, wrongful injury or death. (Corizon was the defendant in more than a thousand of the cases.) Most of the suits were filed pro se, or without the help of a lawyer; petitioners had legal counsel in only about a quarter of them. More than a hundred ended in settlements, but, owing to confidentiality agreements, it is often not clear whether the company or the local government made a payment, or, if so, for how much.Corizon reports that it is responsible for the care of about a hundred and eighty thousand people on a day-to-day basis. Wellpath, which until last November was known as Correct Care Solutions (the company changed its name after merging with a competitor), says that it is responsible for about two hundred and fifty thousand people on any given day. Executives from both companies told me that the lawsuits shouldn’t be seen as indicative of over-all problems with how they treat patients. Many cases involve flimsy or inconclusive evidence and don’t result in findings of liability. Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a prison-health-care consultant based in San Francisco, who advises state and local governments on providing medical services to prisoners, said that, for the companies, managing suits alleging poor treatment is “just a cost of doing business in this industry.”Patrick Cummiskey, Wellpath’s chief strategy officer, told me that the company is concerned, above all, with maintaining good health among inmates, and that it believes that providing quality care will reduce its financial risks in the long run. He also pointed out that Wellpath routinely indemnifies state and local governments from all legal costs in cases involving alleged medical mistakes. “We bear the risk of malpractice,” he said, so “we’re incentivized to provide quality care.”In some states, though, public-interest lawyers have brought class-action suits alleging inadequate health care against the entire system. In Arizona, civil-rights groups filed a class-action suit in 2012. A year later, after the state passed legislation privatizing prison health care, it signed a contract with Corizon to provide medical services in its prisons. In 2015, a federal district court, seeking to resolve the suit, approved a settlement in which the state pledged to overhaul care. But, last June, Judge David Duncan found that “widespread and systemic failures remain,” and held the state in contempt, issuing it fines of more than a million dollars. Martha Harbin, who has served as Corizon’s director of external relations, said in an e-mail that the company does “not agree with the judge’s description” of its performance in Arizona. Last month, the state, which has also disputed the judge’s finding, announced that, as of July, it is awarding the contract to another company.In December, in a case in which a federal judge is supervising a settlement designed to improve medical services at Baltimore’s city jail, the State of Maryland, which oversees the facility, said in court documents that Wexford Health Sources, the company it hired to provide the services, had failed to respond to directions to improve its performance. It had allegedly provided “unreliable” reports, and operated while “critically short of care providers and clerical staff,” leaving “key clinical and leadership positions vacant for lengthy periods.” Wexford lost the contract, though it is not a party to the litigation, and a spokesperson for the company said that it and the state “had a difference in opinion” about how to best provide health care to inmates.Taken as a whole, evidence from cases across the country suggests that four decades of policy failures in both health-care and criminal-justice reform have left a largely neglected population vulnerable and, at times, at risk, and that for-profit companies, which were promoted as a solution, have instead become an integral part of a troubled system.The standard of care that incarcerated people have a right to receive was established in the landmark case of Estelle v. Gamble, in 1976. J. W. Gamble was an inmate in the Huntsville Unit of the Texas prison system. On November 9, 1973, a six-hundred-pound bale of cotton fell on him while he was on work assignment in a textile mill. He complained repeatedly of severe back pain, and prison doctors gave him pain relievers, but they did not take any X-rays. After refusing to work, he was moved to solitary confinement. He filed a pro-se lawsuit, in the form of a twenty-four-page handwritten complaint, objecting to the quality of medical care he had received.A federal judge dismissed the suit, but Gamble appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which appointed Daniel K. Hedges, a corporate litigator in Houston, to represent him. Hedges never met his client, but he argued that Gamble’s treatment was unconstitutional, because of the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, where Hedges again argued it. Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for an eight-to-one majority, found that “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners” was indeed inconsistent with Eighth Amendment guarantees, and ordered that Gamble’s care be reëvaluated.Gamble himself did not benefit from the ruling: after his case was returned to the Fifth Circuit, the appellate court found that his care had not been sufficiently poor to justify compensation. (A few years later, he was killed by a fellow-prisoner.) Still, practitioners of prison medicine today like to point out that, thanks to Gamble’s suit and Marshall’s opinion, the incarcerated are the only people in America with a constitutional right to health care.The Estelle decision was handed down just as the American Medical Association was leading a drive to reform health care for the incarcerated. It conducted a survey of conditions in hundreds of jails, in which operators reported dilapidated and ill-equipped facilities. Many lacked emergency medical equipment. Some didn’t even have first-aid kits. The standard of care set by Estelle was modest, calling only for an absence of “deliberate indifference.” But, building on the decision, the A.M.A. sought to establish uniform standards, which, in turn, led to the creation, in 1983, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care.Estelle also spawned a wave of civil-rights litigation seeking to enforce the Eighth Amendment protection; this gradually led to improvements in the judiciary’s definition of a required standard. Today, prisoners are typically entitled to what a judge for the First Circuit Court of Appeals defined, in 1987, as “adequate” care at a level “reasonably commensurate with modern medical science.” (The irony remains that inmates’ rights to health care have expanded, while citizens on the outside still have no universal right to care.)Litigation, though, is not always the best way to improve public policy. David Cloud, who works on prison-health-care issues for the Vera Institute, a nonprofit research group that focusses on criminal justice, told me, “I definitely don’t want to discount the importance of litigation, because it’s so critical.” Still, he added, correctional health care is more than an arena that requires legal accountability when failures occur. Its troubles affect many people beyond those who are incarcerated. Jails may hire private companies in the interest of saving taxpayer dollars. But, if people suffering from addiction or chronic illness are released back into communities without having received adequate treatment, “they’re still going to draw on taxpayers—just somewhere else.”Companies that contract to provide health care to the incarcerated are tapping into an enormous business opportunity—annual spending now exceeds ten billion dollars—and they are obligated to their owners to seek profit. David Fathi, the director of the National Prison Project, at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me that companies therefore have compelling incentives to cut costs and staff, which can result in “denying care in what is literally a captive market.” He added, “I don’t mean to suggest that government-run prison health care is perfect. It’s often appallingly deficient. But, at least when a government is providing the service, there is some measure of oversight. There is some measure of democratic control.” Apart from the court-enforced standards that have evolved since Estelle, “you don’t have that with the private companies.”Day to day, correctional-care companies treat people on site for complaints like headaches and minor injuries. Nurses wheel carts through cellblocks to dispense over-the-counter and prescription medications; people who are sick can either call out for help or submit written requests. Nurses, nurse practitioners, physician’s assistants, and administrators typically staff jail infirmaries around the clock. In larger, urban jails, doctors, psychiatrists, and social workers may also work on site. In rural counties, they appear perhaps once or twice a week for consultations. When no doctor is present, one is usually on call to consult by telephone in emergencies. In situations requiring surgery or other complex procedures, correctional-care companies are supposed to send patients to a hospital.The companies negotiate multiyear contracts with each jail and prison that they serve. Medical staff, prescription drugs, and outside services such as hospital stays constitute the major costs. Often, the companies receive a per-diem, per-individual rate, so profits depend on holding costs below that amount. Sometimes contracts include provisions that increase a company’s potential profit if it holds down transfers to hospitals or to other outside providers. Medicare and private health-insurance companies follow similar incentives to contain costs, prioritize preventive care, and avoid unnecessary tests and procedures. But a distinct feature of correctional health care is that, if incarcerated people believe that their health—or their life—is in jeopardy, they can’t just drive themselves to an emergency room. As Fathi put it, “Market forces don’t operate in the prison context for the reason that prisoners have absolutely no consumer choice.”The potential effects that contract incentives might have on health care have featured in a number of lawsuits in recent years. One case involved a forty-four-year-old man named Kenneth McGill, who was booked into the jail in Jefferson County, Colorado, after violating probation for a D.U.I. conviction. He had been there two months when, in September of 2012, he began to experience facial drooping and dizziness—symptoms, he thought, of a stroke. He and other inmates reported his symptoms to the deputies on duty and to a nurse with Correctional Healthcare Companies, which had a contract to provide medical services at the jail. (The company has no connection to Correctional Health Partners; in 2014, it was acquired by Correct Care Solutions, the company that became Wellpath.) According to court documents, company staff waited more than twelve hours before sending McGill to a hospital. Doctors there determined that he had had a stroke—he says that he still suffers from vertigo and from a loss of mobility in his right arm—and he sued the company.Anna Holland Edwards, one of McGill’s attorneys, told me that, at the trial, she and her colleagues pointed to a provision in Correctional Healthcare’s contract which stipulated that the company had to pay the first fifty thousand dollars in costs when an inmate went to the hospital. “There’s nothing wrong with being a for-profit company,” she said in her closing argument. “But the intersection of profit and health care has its problems.” She continued, “The company gets to decide whether the care is provided and know that they’re the ones that have to pay for it when it is.” (A spokesperson for the county later disputed that its contract with Correctional Healthcare discouraged hospitalization.) The jury awarded McGill eleven million dollars, including more than seven million in punitive damages against Correctional Healthcare. The parties then settled for an undisclosed amount.David Perry, Wellpath’s chief legal officer, said that Correctional Healthcare’s “way of doing things was different in some respects from ours.” But he also argued that provisions requiring companies to pay for off-site costs, though common, don’t encourage cost-cutting, because, if a company fails to provide quality services, “eventually your clients will hold you accountable for it.”Martha Harbin, of Corizon Health, told me that maximizing on-site care “respects the taxpayer dollars used to pay for correctional health care,” and reduces the risk of people escaping from hospitals. (Escapes from hospitals are, in fact, a recurring problem.) But, she said, “we don’t hesitate to send people off site if the evidence points to that need. If they have to go, they have to go.”Many of the nurses and doctors I spoke with who work in jails described their careers as a moral calling. They serve people on the margins of society: it is not unusual for them to encounter patients who haven’t visited a doctor in years. Ned Higgins, a psychiatrist in South Carolina who has worked on contract for Wellpath, told me that he finds working in county jails inspirational. “We’re helping the seriously mentally ill,” he said. “The vast majority of inmates, patients, that I see were off their medicine when they got arrested. I see our mission as to get them back on their medicine and get them off street drugs. I think we do that very well.” Specialists in the field agree. “People really are trying to provide high-quality health care, and jail environments are really tough,” Brent Gibson, a physician who is the chief health officer of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said. “Nobody wants a bad health-care outcome.”MORE FROM THIS ISSUEMarch 4, 2019Letter from the U.K.The Psychiatrist Who Believed People Could Tell the FutureBy Sam KnightThe TheatreStephen Sondheim and Lynn Nottage Revivals Time-Travel Through Artists’ LivesBy Sarah LarsonFeedback Dept.Is the Strand a Landmark?By Micah HauserShouts & MurmursCongratulations on Your New DebtBy Kate SidleyFiction“The Starlet Apartments”By Jonathan LethemGoings On About TownThe Temptations Get a Broadway Jukebox MusicalStill, a significant amount of the serious neglect documented in lawsuits arises from the fact that jails have become a primary provider of medical care for the severely mentally ill. Rhonda Levand was confronted with the sometimes harsh consequences of that reality in the case of her daughter, Raynbow Gignilliat. In 1992, when Gignilliat was seventeen and in her junior year of high school, in Marietta, Georgia, she was given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Eventually, she graduated from college, got married, had three sons, and worked as a paralegal, a substitute teacher, and a freelance writer. She didn’t always take her medications, Levand told me, and “every year she would go through a little cycle where she was a little bit manic.” But then she would right herself.In 2013, Gignilliat and her husband divorced, which seemed to trigger a new crisis for her and led to a number of short hospital stays. Levand by then was living near Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she now works as a paraprofessional special-education teacher and a receptionist. That October, she invited her daughter to stay with her. Gignilliat had never been violent with her before, Levand said, but on October 27th she started “pushing and shoving” her, and upending furniture and breaking things in the house. Levand called the police, and Gignilliat was arrested for aggravated battery and property damage, and was taken to the Sandoval County Detention Center.The health services at the jail were provided by Correctional Healthcare, the company that was later acquired by Wellpath. Medical staff noted that Gignilliat had mental-health needs, but she refused to take medication. “If they don’t consent to take the medicine, they don’t force them,” Levand told me. In fact, neither the company nor the jail had legal authority to do so; in New Mexico, such action requires state-court approval. Medical or jail staff could have petitioned a judge to name a “treatment guardian” for Gignilliat, but did not. Levand could have petitioned, too, but says she didn’t know that this was an option.After a social worker referred Gignilliat to a physician’s assistant for psychiatric evaluation, corrections officers placed her in a segregated cell, according to a legal complaint. She was allowed to leave it only to take a shower or to consult with a social worker or with medical staff; some days, she refused a shower and did not leave her cell at all. By mid-December, she had become deeply delusional, and the warden finally transferred her to the emergency room at the University of New Mexico Hospital. A doctor there diagnosed bipolar disorder and psychosis, treated her with anti-anxiety medication, and persuaded her to eat—according to Levand, she had lost about twenty pounds. She was then sent back to jail, where she again went unmedicated.Two weeks later, Gignilliat was transferred to the New Mexico Behavioral Health Institute. Staff there obtained a court-appointed treatment guardianship, and, in late January of 2014, she was administered medication, and her condition stabilized. At the end of March, the district attorney dropped the criminal charges against her, and she went back to Georgia. Photographs taken there show her smiling as she embraces her children. Yet, on June 12th, she swallowed a fatal dose of pills; she died two days later, at the age of thirty-nine.The next month, Levand filed suit on behalf of Gignilliat’s children. Sandoval County and Wellpath, which inherited the liabilities in the case from Correctional Healthcare, said that, since Gignilliat’s suicide took place more than two months after she was released, they bore no responsibility. However, court papers filed by Levand describe starkly the daily suffering that her daughter endured while in segregation. Ultimately, the county and the company agreed to a confidential financial settlement. David Perry said that Wellpath rarely pursues jury trials, because “it is very expensive to litigate cases, notwithstanding how justified you believe your position to be.”The situation that Gignilliat encountered is not uncommon: few local jails have dedicated mental-health facilities, and operators often resort to managing people by placing them in segregation. Yet even in jails that do provide dedicated care the quality can be poor. In the summer of 2013, Bradley Ballard was detained in New York City’s jail on Rikers Island for a parole violation. He was thirty-nine years old and suffered from diabetes, but he had previously received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and was assigned to the mental-health unit. Under a contract signed with the city in 2001, Corizon Health shared responsibility for medical services at Rikers and oversaw the mental-health facility.In September, according to a legal complaint, Ballard was moved to solitary confinement, after dancing provocatively in front of a female corrections officer. For six days, medical personnel and jail guards looked in on him, but did not offer him any assistance. He was then discovered lying naked and covered in his own waste. He had mutilated his genitals, and died hours after being found, from sepsis and diabetic ketoacidosis.In 2014, civil-rights lawyers filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ballard’s mother and his estate. The New York State Commission of Correction, in reviewing the case, said that the performance of the company and of the city’s Department of Corrections was so “incompetent and inadequate as to shock the conscience.” The city paid nearly six million dollars, reportedly the largest settlement involving the death of an inmate in the city’s custody. (Corizon did not contribute any of the funds, because, according to Martha Harbin, the contract stipulated that the city would bear financial responsibility for all malpractice claims.) Corizon’s contract expired at the end of 2015, and it was not renewed. A group of New York-based nonprofit health-care providers has since taken over the provision of medical services at Rikers. The Department of Corrections Commissioner, Cynthia Brann, said in a statement that, with the new arrangement, the city has “taken major steps to overhaul the delivery of healthcare in our jails.”Both jail operators and private health-care companies recognize that it would be better to treat mentally ill people, especially those who are nonviolent, in specialized hospitals or in dedicated units in jails. But building those facilities and hiring counsellors and psychiatrists to staff them requires government funding that many operators don’t have. There are “never enough beds” to accommodate such cases, Patrick Cummiskey, of Wellpath, told me. Jails are “absolutely the wrong place” to treat mental illness, he said, yet they “have become the largest mental-health provider in most communities.” David Perry said that Wellpath no longer bids on contracts in counties where there is a “disproportionate number of mental-health cases” and inadequate local resources to handle them. “We don’t get involved,” he said. “You’re just setting yourself up for this problem.” Poor care for mentally ill prisoners, he added, reflects taxpayers’ unwillingness to fund dedicated facilities and programs, not “our company’s quality.”Opioid addiction, too, is an area in which jail health care is increasingly relied on by default. Last year, according to a preliminary estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than seventy-two thousand people died from overdoses—almost two hundred people a day. The C.D.C. has also reported that overdoses now constitute the leading cause of death among Americans under the age of fifty. And many people suffering from addiction pass through jails on charges related to their habit.Madaline Pitkin was one of them. She grew up in Portland, Oregon, and attended Catholic school, where she was a good student. She was “very spirited,” her father, Russell Pitkin, told me. “She was always into competition and sports and was always trying to improve herself.” She enrolled at the University of Oregon, but wasn’t happy there, so she switched, for a time, to Portland Community College. According to the Oregonian, which ran a series of articles on her case, she sometimes paid her bills by working as a barista or, at Christmas, as one of Santa’s elves.At some point in her twenties, she drifted into heroin addiction, and, in April of 2014, she was arrested on a warrant for an earlier arrest and for possession. During her booking at the Washington County jail, which, until May of 2015, had a contract with Corizon Health, she told a nurse that she used a gram of heroin a day. A week later, at the age of twenty-six, she died of dehydration, after vomiting and suffering diarrhea as she went through withdrawal. Company personnel allegedly failed to provide an I.V. to keep her hydrated, and did not respond adequately to her four handwritten pleas for help. In her final request, on April 23rd, she wrote, “I haven’t been able to keep food, liquids, meds down in six days. I feel like I am very close to death. . . . Please help me.”Last December, a federal judge approved a ten-million-dollar judgment against Corizon and Washington County for Pitkin’s family, the largest known amount that the company has been ordered to pay. (Corizon had fully indemnified the county.) Steve Rector, who became Corizon’s C.E.O. last year, said in a statement, “The lessons we’ve learned from this case have been catalysts for significant changes we have made and are still making to our clinical program.” The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said that Pitkin’s death was a “tragedy,” and that it has reformed health care at the jail, with a new private company.Nancy Fishman, a criminal-justice policy expert at the Vera Institute, told me that “every sort of convocation of sheriffs or jail administrators or law enforcement” these days is consumed by the opioid crisis and its impact on jail health care. She added, “There’s just a sort of general sense that we’re being overwhelmed, and we don’t know what to do.” Brent Gibson, of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, said that “not everyone accepts that substance abuse is a chronic disease.” Some jails treat addiction as a “moral problem,” and treat opioid withdrawal only with drugs that alleviate its symptoms.In other jurisdictions, sheriffs and administrators do follow the recommendations of public-health advocates who argue that the best way to defeat addiction is to guide people toward long-term treatment, with access to methadone or to similar drugs that can allow them to either safely maintain their opioid use or gradually reduce and cease it. The National Commission recommends that prisons and jails adopt a comprehensive treatment plan that includes medications to ease withdrawal and others, such as buprenorphine, that safely satisfy cravings for drugs.The commission also advises psychological counselling and in-detention meetings with recovery groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous. But the resources to support such public-health approaches are small in comparison with the vast sums spent on jails and prisons themselves. David Cloud, of the Vera Institute, said that many rural and poor counties “don’t even have medications or treatment providers in the community” to address opioid addiction, let alone in their jails.On August 18, 2016, Sally Yates, then the Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration, released a memorandum directing the Federal Bureau of Prisons to begin “the process of reducing—and ultimately ending—our use of privately operated prisons.” The memorandum did not address for-profit correctional-health-care companies directly, but it was the boldest turn away from the country’s partially privatized incarceration system in decades. The Presidential election was less than three months away, and Hillary Clinton, who was then leading Donald Trump comfortably in most polls, tweeted her support, suggesting that the order would stand if she won the White House. The share prices of the country’s two largest private-prison builders and operators, GEO Group and Corrections Corporation of America (since renamed CoreCivic), fell by nearly forty per cent in a single day. After Trump was inaugurated, one of the first acts of his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, was to rescind the Yates order. (After the election, according to the Washington Post, GEO hired two people who had worked in Sessions’s Senate office to lobby for the company’s interests.)Opponents of privatized detention have argued, on philosophical and constitutional grounds, that certain governmental powers—such as those to wage war, to use lethal force in the name of the law, and to hold people in detention—should not be hired out to profit-seekers. Yates’s decision was made on a more pragmatic basis: drawing on the findings of a study produced earlier that August by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, she asserted that the government is better at running prisons than corporations are. Private companies, she wrote, “simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs,” and “they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.”The concurrent rise of for-profit health care in jails and prisons has not been accompanied by the kind of public debate, congressional scrutiny, or scholarly research that has informed other fields of health policy. Yet there are notable public and nonprofit alternatives. In some European Union countries, where universal access to health care is fully established, prison and jail health care is often administered by state health services. In the Netherlands, for example, a specialized public service treats prisoners on the basis of an “equivalence principle,” meaning that the care provided should be the same as if they were free citizens.In this country, some physicians and health-care specialists advocate for greater investment in community treatment centers—residential and nonresidential facilities that seek to treat and stabilize individuals suffering from addiction or mental illness through medication, peer counselling, and social services, and where nonviolent offenders suffering from these conditions might be directed, as an alternative to jail. Other practitioners argue that prison health services in the United States work best when they are provided by nonprofits that also deliver medical services for the general population (as is now the case in New York City). Since the late nineteen-eighties, four states—Texas, Georgia, New Jersey, and Connecticut—have contracted prison medical services to their state university systems, whose facilities also serve the public.Newton Kendig, a physician specializing in infectious diseases and a clinical professor of medicine at George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., has spent most of his career overseeing health care in prisons. He told me that contracting with public universities has advantages—for example, specialists on a medical-school faculty can consult on prisoners’ cases. The University of Texas has pioneered the use of telemedicine, or videoconferencing, to treat the incarcerated. But the university model hasn’t always succeeded. Last July, after a woman gave birth in her cell at the York Correctional Institution, in Niantic, Connecticut, where health care was overseen by the University of Connecticut, and where there had been other complaints about care, officials transferred responsibility for prisoner health care statewide back to the state corrections agency.I met Kendig last summer in his office at George Washington’s medical school, where he is currently leading an initiative to draw on academic medical expertise to improve health care for inmates. Now in his early sixties, he told me that he had chosen to practice in correctional health because he “wanted to care for at-risk populations.” He served as the director of medicine for Maryland’s correctional facilities, and then, in 1996, he joined the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is overseen by the Surgeon General. After twenty years of service, he retired as a rear admiral and an Assistant Surgeon General.The Commissioned Corps is another public model that might be adapted to provide an alternative to privatization. It is a uniformed medical civil service of more than six thousand physicians, public-health specialists, and other professionals. Among other duties, members design and manage medical and mental-health programs for federal prisoners. They also work for the C.D.C., to monitor and respond to epidemics, and provide medical expertise during emergencies, such as hurricanes.Kendig told me that the corps’s public-service mission, the opportunity it provides to work for diverse federal agencies, and its generous government pensions have helped it to recruit and retain talented personnel devoted to prison health care, which is, as he put it, a “highly structured and paramilitary environment” that requires a “special person” to embrace it for a career. “The advantage of the public model is that public service gives you stability,” he continued. “The turnover in the private sector is very high.” However, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have proved hostile to expansions of publicly funded medical services. Last year, the Administration, as part of its drive to reduce nonmilitary federal spending, proposed cutting the corps’s budget by forty per cent.There are, nevertheless, signs that the country is moving toward a new consensus on criminal-justice reform. That includes support within the Republican Party for public policies that may improve medical services for the incarcerated. A major advancement in the field was reached in May of last year, when the Texas state legislature passed the Sandra Bland Act.On July 10, 2015, Bland, a twenty-eight-year-old African-American woman, was stopped in her car by a police officer in Waller County, northwest of Houston, for failing to signal a lane change. In an encounter captured by the officer’s dashboard camera, Bland argued with him, and he escalated the confrontation, finally pulling out a Taser and shouting, “I will light you up!” He arrested her and booked her into the county jail. During her processing, Bland said that she had attempted suicide earlier that year, following a miscarriage. Three days later, she hanged herself in her cell.A grand jury indicted the officer on a perjury charge, but prosecutors dropped it in exchange for his agreement to never again work as a policeman. Bland’s family reached a settlement with the county, which reportedly paid close to two million dollars. The law enacted in her name requires authorities to make a “good-faith effort” to divert anyone who is arrested and is suffering from acute mental illness or addiction away from jail and into treatment, particularly if the illness or addiction is related to the reason that the person was arrested. The “good-faith” standard for sheriffs and jail operators is a soft one, but lawmakers have created incentives for judges to grant bail to the afflicted, and have provided ninety-two million dollars in new funding for mental-health services and monitoring of people judged to be suicide risks.The Bland Act was introduced by Democrats, but, after some police-reform measures were removed, it passed unanimously in the Republican-led legislature, and was signed by Governor Greg Abbott, a conservative Republican. That bipartisan support reinforced what I heard from sheriffs and jail-health specialists elsewhere: that the effort to address the unnecessary suffering and loss of life caused by inadequate mental-health and addiction treatment must transcend the current polarization of national politics. Health care isn’t the only sector of criminal-justice reform in which cross-party coalitions have formed. In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act, which passed in the Senate in a vote of eighty-seven to twelve, and which the House of Representatives approved in a vote of three hundred and sixty to fifty-nine. Among other things, the law is intended to reduce the nation’s incarceration rates by lowering mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.Kenneth L. Favier, a theologian and a public-health specialist, argues in his 2017 book, “Humane Health Care for Prisoners,” that a “radical revision” of the criminal-justice and mental-health systems is needed, to transfer “large numbers” of people suffering from mental illness “into community treatment settings as well as prevent such persons from being arrested and incarcerated in the first place.”Historically, sweeping changes in civil rights have occurred only after a moral awakening among at least a vocal minority of the public. So far, the articulation of a better ethic of prison medicine is mostly consigned to a small body of specialized literature, including Favier’s book. His core principle succinctly echoes European policies and standards, as well as the standards advocated in civil-rights lawsuits since Estelle v. Gamble. He writes that, except for “understandable and acceptable” constraints required for the administration of safe custody, “it should not matter that one is a prisoner.”The powerlessness of prisoners makes that a difficult standard to attain, as Jeremy Laintz discovered in Pueblo County. After his hospitalization and surgeries, he entered an in-patient rehabilitation facility in Denver, to learn how to walk again and to strengthen his damaged lung. When he got out, in April of 2017, six months had passed since he was first sentenced to serve three months in jail. He moved in with his parents, started taking buprenorphine, and volunteered for a time at a local needle exchange. Laintz is now forty, and, when I spoke to him on the phone recently, he told me that he is unable to walk for ten minutes without needing to sit down. He is not working.He had done time before, and he understood that, when he went to jail, he would lose many of the rights that are taken for granted by people on the outside. Yet he had always trusted that, if he ever found himself in need of urgent help, he would be taken seriously. On this occasion, he said, “they treated me the whole time like I was lying to them.” But he also felt fortunate: his parents believed him when he said that he was in pain, and they pushed to get him help. Other people have no such advocates. “I know there are people dying,” Laintz said. “I was almost one of them.” ♦Steve Coll, a staff writer, is the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.

14,Tablets vs. Textbooks,Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?,1s14q7r,https://thejournal.com/articles/2012/08/08/affording-the-classroom-of-the-future.aspx,Affording the Classroom of the Future -- THE Journal,"Welcome toAdvanced Search21st Century Schools | FeatureThe new technology being infused into today's classrooms doesn't come cheap; nor is it always easy to install, repair, maintain, and upgrade. Physical facilities take time and money to upgrade and replace, and teachers must be trained on how to use any new equipment and applications that are introduced into the classroom. For the 21st Century classroom to operate at an optimal level all three legs of the stool must be addressed--and that costs money.New technology equipment and tools, state of the art building materials and methods, and experimental teaching practices are all impacting today's K-12 classroom. Districts nationwide are struggling to patch together learning environments that they think represent the future of learning at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels. As they adopt campus-wide IT infrastructures, invest in classroom technology, and test out alternatives to traditional learning spaces, the final results of all this innovation remains to be seen. To help decipher that code and give principals, administrators, IT directors, and teachers an insider look into what might be coming a few years down the road, THE Journal asked a half a dozen educational experts for their take on three different key concerns: what the classrooms will look like, who will pay for them, and whether we'll ever see them during our lifetimes.Envisioning the Classroom of the Future: What Does It Look Like? Susan Smith has been designing educational facilities for 18 years. During that time this vice president of Dallas-based architectural design firm Corgan Associates has seen significant changes in the way K-12 facilities are constructed and utilized. At a high, campus-wide level, Smith said energy conservation--made possible through more environmentally inconsequential construction materials and methods--is top of mind right now for schools. Some districts, for example, want net zero campuses that rely on alternative sources like solar and wind technology to generate as much energy as the schools use. Smith said she expects to see more net zero campuses being built in the future and said the green philosophy will make its way into the classroom itself. Simple moves like minimizing the number of electrical outlets in a room, for example, help encourage the use of charging stations. Lighting sensors that adapt to the amount of light that's coming in through windows and geothermal technology that heats water for bathrooms and the cafeteria will also gain in popularity, Smith predicted. The classroom of the future will also be more flexible than its predecessors. ""We are seeing a movement towards more project-based learning and that requires much more adaptable and flexible physical space than we're used to seeing in K-12,"" said Smith. Expect to see more spaces that can quickly be rearranged to accommodate individual study, small group learning, and even collaboration across different classes and subjects. A space meant to accommodate 30 students, for example, would be built with moveable walls that could be quickly opened to allow multiple instructors to teach to 60 or more students in a large group.

Affording the Classroom of the Future -- THE Journal Welcome toAdvanced Search21st Century Schools | FeatureThe new technology being infused into today's classrooms doesn't come cheap; nor is it always easy to install, repair, maintain, and upgrade. Physical facilities take time and money to upgrade and replace, and teachers must be trained on how to use any new equipment and applications that are introduced into the classroom. For the 21st Century classroom to operate at an optimal level all three legs of the stool must be addressed--and that costs money.New technology equipment and tools, state of the art building materials and methods, and experimental teaching practices are all impacting today's K-12 classroom. Districts nationwide are struggling to patch together learning environments that they think represent the future of learning at the elementary, middle school, and high school levels. As they adopt campus-wide IT infrastructures, invest in classroom technology, and test out alternatives to traditional learning spaces, the final results of all this innovation remains to be seen. To help decipher that code and give principals, administrators, IT directors, and teachers an insider look into what might be coming a few years down the road, THE Journal asked a half a dozen educational experts for their take on three different key concerns: what the classrooms will look like, who will pay for them, and whether we'll ever see them during our lifetimes.Envisioning the Classroom of the Future: What Does It Look Like? Susan Smith has been designing educational facilities for 18 years. During that time this vice president of Dallas-based architectural design firm Corgan Associates has seen significant changes in the way K-12 facilities are constructed and utilized. At a high, campus-wide level, Smith said energy conservation--made possible through more environmentally inconsequential construction materials and methods--is top of mind right now for schools. Some districts, for example, want net zero campuses that rely on alternative sources like solar and wind technology to generate as much energy as the schools use. Smith said she expects to see more net zero campuses being built in the future and said the green philosophy will make its way into the classroom itself. Simple moves like minimizing the number of electrical outlets in a room, for example, help encourage the use of charging stations. Lighting sensors that adapt to the amount of light that's coming in through windows and geothermal technology that heats water for bathrooms and the cafeteria will also gain in popularity, Smith predicted. The classroom of the future will also be more flexible than its predecessors. ""We are seeing a movement towards more project-based learning and that requires much more adaptable and flexible physical space than we're used to seeing in K-12,"" said Smith. Expect to see more spaces that can quickly be rearranged to accommodate individual study, small group learning, and even collaboration across different classes and subjects. A space meant to accommodate 30 students, for example, would be built with moveable walls that could be quickly opened to allow multiple instructors to teach to 60 or more students in a large group. ""The focus will be on interchangeability,"" said Smith, ""and that requires a break down of the traditional classroom walls to make room for more innovative learning setups.""""Instead of students sitting in five or six straight rows of desks,"" said Tim Uhl, principal at Holy Rosary School in Tacoma, WA, ""they'll be sitting in pods and then moving back into rows when it's time to test.""

7,Vegetarianism,Should People Become Vegetarian?,2s7q10r,https://newrepublic.com/article/153085/cory-booker-first-vegan-president,Cory Booker: America's Broccoli Head of State | The New Republic,"Pork rinds in Tabasco sauce. Cheeseburger pizza. Well-done steak with ketchup. Cory Booker can’t eat any of these presidential favorites. The U.S. senator from New Jersey, who announced his candidacy for president earlier this month, is a vegan, meaning he doesn’t eat food that’s made of, or from, animals. Meat is off the table, as is anything with milk, cheese, or eggs. So Booker can’t indulge in smoked salt caramels, as Obama did, because they contain milk chocolate. He can’t even eat the jelly beans that Ronald Reagan loved because they’re made with gelatin, which includes animal collagen.Booker is looking to make history with his 2020 bid. America has never elected a vegetarian president before, much less a vegan. Before Booker, a vegetarian had never even been elected to the Senate before. (He says he switched fully to veganism on Election Day 2014.) There appears to be just one self-identified vegan in the House of Representatives—California Congressman Adam Schiff—and only a handful of vegetarians.*Some might argue that there’s a dearth of plant-eaters in public office because there aren’t that many in the U.S. overall. Around 8 percent of Americans identify as strict vegan or strict vegetarian, a figure that has remained steady for the last two decades. But that’s still about 26 million people who have barely had any representation in Washington. Their numbers are similar to other chronically underrepresented identity groups. LGBTQ Americans make up only 4.5 percent of the population. Black and Hispanic Americans make up about 13 and 18 percent, respectively.The political and cultural forces that privilege white, straight, Christian men in the halls of power are well known. But why do voters consistently put meat-eaters in the White House? How hard would the meat industry—and meat-lovers—fight to keep that in place? Booker’s candidacy provides a unique opportunity to find out.The power that meat plays in American politics has never been truly tested before. Ben Carson is a vegetarian, but he never really talked about when he ran for president in 2016. It didn’t shape his political identity.Booker talks about his diet all the time. When he campaigned for Hillary Clinton in 2016, he joked that he was campaigning as her VP—or “vegan pal.” He posts pictures of vegan food to his Twitter and Instagram feeds. He serves vegan dishes to members of Congress. He talks about the benefits a vegan diet could have for African Americans, who suffer disproportionately from heart disease and high cholesterol. If he won the Democratic nomination, Booker would become the most high-profile plant eater in the country—after Beyoncé, anyway.The 49-year-old senator makes a moral argument for his veganism. “I began saying I was a vegetarian because, for me, it was the best way to live in accordance to the ideals and values that I have,” Booker, who did not respond to my requests for an interview, told VegNews recently. “You see the planet earth moving towards what is the Standard American Diet. We’ve seen this massive increase in consumption of meat produced by the industrial animal agriculture industry. The tragic reality is this planet simply can’t sustain billions of people consuming industrially produced animal agriculture because of environmental impact.”Still, Booker has said he doesn’t believe his diet will be a factor in the minds of 2020 voters. “I think people are concerned about what kind of leader I’ll be,” he told The Atlantic’s Julia Ioffe last year. “When I go around New Jersey, nobody’s asking me about my personal life.”Lawrence Rosenthal, who heads up the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies, disagrees. “The likelihood is good the [Republicans] will go after Booker for this,” he said in an email. There is “considerable precedent,” he argued, for Republicans using personal behavior such as diet to portray Democrats as elitist and out of touch. A 2004 attack ad against Howard Dean, for example, portrayed him as “latte-drinking” and “sushi-eating.” The idea, Rosenthal said, was to “play into the ‘us versus them’ sentiment (largely resentment) that is the prime motivator of populist politics—the ‘real Americans’ versus the (in this case cultural) ‘elites.’”Obama experienced something similar during his first presidential run, in a pseudo-scandal known as “Arugula-gate.” At an Iowa farm in 2007, Obama railed against the high price of produce in America. “Anybody gone into Whole Foods lately and see what they charge for arugula?” he said. “I mean, they’re charging a lot of money for this stuff.” This was used by the right as evidence that Obama had “simply worn silk stockings and rode in limos far too long.”Presidential candidates from both parties often use food as a way to relate to voters on the campaign trail. But what constitutes relatable food is almost always unhealthy and animal-based. At the Iowa State Fair, presidential candidates seek photo ops with a 600-pound cow carved out of butter, fried candy bars on sticks, and hot beef sundaes. By campaigning as a vegan, Booker “risks coming across as removed from the hoi polloi,” Michael Dorf, an animal rights law professor at Cornell, wrote last year. “He cannot show his love for all things Americana by eating a stick of deep fried butter at the Iowa State Fair.”It’s also possible that, in an era where “Soy Boy” has become a popular alt-right insult, Booker’s conservative opponents will use his veganism to belittle him. “The idea that soy is a phytoestrogen, and thus men who consume it are less masculine than meat-eaters, is often expressed by people on the far right,” said George Hawley, an assistant political science professor at the University of Alabama. Hawley doesn’t believe the far-right will be as active in the 2020 election cycle, but mainstream Republicans still use food to attack liberals. Ahead of last year’s midterm elections, Senator Ted Cruz attacked his opponent, Beto O’Rourke, by claiming he “wants Texas to become like California, right down to the tofu.”But one should not expect to find disdain for Booker’s veganism exclusively on the right. Americans from all political leanings tend to find vegans, well, annoying. Meat-eaters often feel that vegans are morally judging them, or even trying to impose their diets on everyone else. Booker’s opponents, especially those who disagree with his environmental positions, may appeal to those sentiments for campaign ads. Pundits have already shown it’s done. In a 2015 op-ed in The New York Post, Eliyahu Federman accused Booker of “animal-rights extremism” for co-sponsoring a bill limiting antibiotics in livestock, supporting New Jersey legislation to ban gestation crates for pigs, and pushing for a no-kill animal shelter in Newark. In a then-recent interview, he wrote, “Booker talked as if it’s all personal, explaining how ‘being vegan for me is a cleaner way of not participating in practices that don’t align with my values.’ Problem is, he plainly wants to impose those values on the rest of us.”Such attacks seem all but inevitable as the presidential campaign season accelerates. But that doesn’t mean they’ll work. Strict vegetarians and vegans may not be growing as an interest group, but Americans are warming to the idea that they should be eating more plants—not just for the environment, but their own health. People who identify as “flexitarians”—eating mostly plant-based, but cheating a little—now make up about a third of the population, and 52 percent of people report trying to incorporate more plant-based meals in their diet. The meat and dairy industries haven’t taken this cultural shift lightly. As the popularity of plant-based products grows, the dairy industry is lobbying Congress and the FDA to demand that soy and almond milk producers stop using the word “milk” on their labels, and the beef industry wants to make sure plant-based burgers can’t use the word “meat.” The beef industry also spent millions making sure the Department of Agriculture didn’t listen to scientists, health and climate advocates who said nutritional guidelines should be changed to recommend Americans eat less meat.The meat industry has considerable political muscle to flex. It contributes about $894 billion in total to the U.S. economy, according to the North American Meat Institute. “That size translates into political influence,” The Atlantic reported in 2015. “In 2014, the industry spent approximately $10.8 million in contributions to political campaigns, and an estimated $6.9 million directly on lobbying the federal government.” An OpenSecrets analysis of agribusiness lobbying shows that the meat and dairy industries’ political spending spikes as demand for those products fall. How will they respond when a vegan starts making waves on the campaign trail?Even the Iowa State Fair now has vegan options. “Cory Booker can come to my stand,” said Connie Boesen, a Des Moines City Council member who’s been running her Applishus stand for 34 years. She sells multiple things on a stick: peanut butter and jelly, fruit, and even salad (essentially a skewer of cubed peppers, mushroom, carrots, cucumbers and lettuce). If Booker doesn’t want to partake in the usual candidate photo-op of flipping a pork chop, Boesen said, “I’ll invite him to come slice an apple.”* A previous version of this story stated that there were no self-identified vegans in the House of Representatives.Emily Atkin is a staff writer at The New Republic.",2,10,Neutral,Against,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Against', 'Neutral']","Should People Become Vegetarian?

The most recent adjustment being proposed to protect Maryland patients is the creation of a Health Insurance Down Payment Plan, legislation introduced by Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk and Sen. Brian Feldman.The Health Insurance Down Payment Plan will help the uninsured and shrink uncompensated care by creating health insurance cost fairness for everyone. Here’s how it would work: At tax time, Marylanders would be asked if they had quality health coverage in the past year. If they answer “no,” they have a choice — either pay a penalty to the state or instead use that money to purchase quality, affordable health care.Maryland lawmakers, worried about skyrocketing insurance premiums, have proposed creating a state-level individual mandate — and using fines levied on the uninsured to help put more people on the insurance rolls.Last month, congressional Republicans repealed the federal individual mandate at the...The Maryland down payment plan is not the ACA mandate; it’s a significant improvement. The ACA’s individual mandate took a largely punitive approach to encouraging consumers to fulfill this responsibility, imposing federal income tax penalties on people who lacked coverage the previous year and did not qualify them for a tax exemption.

Md. health insurance 'down payment' improvement over ACA mandate - Baltimore Sun As Washington politics continues to risk instability for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health insurance markets, Maryland policy makers are working in a bipartisan manner in the best interests of the citizens of Maryland. The most recent adjustment being proposed to protect Maryland patients is the creation of a Health Insurance Down Payment Plan, legislation introduced by Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk and Sen. Brian Feldman.The Health Insurance Down Payment Plan will help the uninsured and shrink uncompensated care by creating health insurance cost fairness for everyone. Here’s how it would work: At tax time, Marylanders would be asked if they had quality health coverage in the past year. If they answer “no,” they have a choice — either pay a penalty to the state or instead use that money to purchase quality, affordable health care.Maryland lawmakers, worried about skyrocketing insurance premiums, have proposed creating a state-level individual mandate — and using fines levied on the uninsured to help put more people on the insurance rolls.Last month, congressional Republicans repealed the federal individual mandate at the...The Maryland down payment plan is not the ACA mandate; it’s a significant improvement. The ACA’s individual mandate took a largely punitive approach to encouraging consumers to fulfill this responsibility, imposing federal income tax penalties on people who lacked coverage the previous year and did not qualify them for a tax exemption.

Mixing public funds in private institutions is never a good idea. A great deal of the mischief done in this country is by private groups financed by the federal government.Government and private business should be kept as separate as government and church. I don't know of any instance in which mixing public funds with private funds has produced a good result.So that's one general reason vouchers are a bad idea.Another reason is that private schools that accept public-financed vouchers soon will find themselves controlled by federal and state bureaucrats. Any private-school administrator who doesn't believe this is naive. Control follows funds like the hind end of a hog follows the head. The long-term result will be that private schools will become as bad as government schools.Still another reason vouchers are a bad idea is that they being sold on a false premise. The sales pitch for vouchers goes like this: Poor students trapped in ``bad schools'' should have the opportunity to go to private schools.That's false because what makes a bad school bad is not the faculty or the building or the location - but the students. Bad students will turn a school into a bad school whether it's private or public. In fact, the virtue of private schools is that they can reject the bad students. Once they start down the road of accepting public funds, however, this option will be closed to them by the government.The guiding principle of the current ruling elite or knowledge class or whatever you want to call it is that people are never responsible for themselves. Thus, if the students score poorly, it is not the fault of the students. It must be the fault of the teachers or the administrators or some unknown cosmic forces, they assert. The simple truth is that the fault lies with the student and no one else.This non-responsibility ploy not only fits the determinist model, but it also saves cowardly politi- cians from having to tell sorry students and often even-sorrier parents the truth: The hole you are in is the hole you dug yourself. God only knows that the last thing a politician wants to say these days to anyone is you're responsible for your own fate.Another reason to oppose vouchers is that it will end up being a subsidy for the well-off. The poor-kid ploy is the sales pitch, but let it take hold and you'll find out that the kids whose parents are able to pay the difference between the voucher and the private-school tuition will be those from middle- and upper-income families. Once more the working, single mom in a dangerous, convenience-store job will end up subsidizing the lawyer, the journalist, the executive, the doctor and the businessman.Another false premise used to sell the idea of vouchers is the assertion that government schools will be forced to become competitive. Government schools cannot compete in any sense of that word. They are government schools, creatures of the law and politics. Faculty, its pay, and the curricula are determined not by the schools but by politicians, bureaucrats and, in some cases, judges.To state that public schools can compete with private schools is like saying a bronze statue of a horse can run a race with a live horse.",1,1,Against,Against,Against,0,Against,"['Against', 'Against', 'Against']","Are School Vouchers a Good Idea?

By Arturo Lopez-Levy, December 4, 2013. Obama administration officials say they want to improve ties between the U.S. and Cuba, but U.S. restrictions on Cuban finances have made it impossible for Cuba to keep its interest section open. (Image: scottmontreal / Flickr)Just before Thanksgiving, Cuban-American families who had hoped to spend the holidays with their Cuban relatives got some bad news.On November 26th, Cuba suspended consular services — including the issuing of passports and visas — at its interest section in Washington. The move came after the Buffalo-based M & T Bank announced this summer that it would stop providing Cuba with banking services in the United States. The Cuban government could not find another bank to take its place.When President Barack Obama called earlier this year for U.S. relations with Cuba to be “updated,” this is probably not what he had in mind.The reduction in services — and the resulting obstacles for traveling — flies in the face of recent efforts to improve relations between the two countries. President Obama has loosened travel restrictions for Cuban Americans, permitted remittances, and promoted educational, cultural, and religious exchanges with the island. The closure of Cuba’s consulate goes in precisely the other direction, upending much of this work.Behind the scenes, the U.S. government is seeking to address the immediate crisis by finding another bank to provide services so the consulate can open again. But because of harsh U.S. sanctions against Cuba, banks are hesitant to do business with the island for fear of running afoul of U.S. law. Instead of seeking a superficial fix, the United States needs to lift its trade embargo on Cuba or at least remove the country from the state terrorism list. The time has come to normalize economic ties, improve political relations, and allow financial transactions to function regularly.De Facto EmbassiesIn the absence of diplomatic relations and official embassies, Cuba and the United States have “interest sections” that house the countries’ consulates. Officially part of Switzerland’s embassies (although in practice operating independently from them), these offices grant visas and handle other personal records and procedures. The interest sections began in 1977, during the Carter administration, in an effort to re-establish some of the bilateral connections that had been severed in 1961.Both governments appreciate the benefits interest sections provide. Cuba’s mission in Washington provides it with critical access to the U.S. political scene and the Cuban-American community abroad. Likewise, the U.S. government values its office in Cuba. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held that the Havana office allowed Washington to remain informed, provided a venue for positive interaction with Cuban society, and facilitated discussions about issues of mutual interest with the host government. In her book No Higher Honor: A Memoir of My Years in Washington, she went so far as to propose that the United States institute a similar “interest section” model in its relations with Iran.Moreover, the interest sections provide crucial services to citizens. Cubans in the United States rely on the consular services for travel to the island. Other Americans have been able to engage in new opportunities for cultural and educational exchange.ContradictionsBut the U.S. government’s own policies are frustrating the Obama administration’s stated goals of improving ties with Cuba, closing off even this limited point of contact.The current problems come on the heels of a gradual opening of relations between the two countries. Both President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have recognized the significant positive changes occurring in Cuba and say they want to encourage them. Speaking before the Organization of American States shortly before the consulate closure, Kerry stressed the U.S. commitment to allowing certain travelers and remittances to Cuba. He said U.S. citizens visiting Cuba benefit the country by acting as “ambassadors of our ideals, values, ​​and beliefs.”But throughout the U.S. government, a punitive, Cold-War-era approach to Cuba remains firmly ensconced. The Helms-Burton Act, which beginning in 1996 intensified the U.S. embargo toward Cuba, still restricts visits to and from the island. Moreover, Kerry’s own State Department continually refuses to remove Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, despite providing no reasonable justification for keeping it on.Instead of using taxpayer money to pursue real terrorists, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has stepped up sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba. The policy has caused a panic among banks, leaving them unwilling to risk servicing the Cuban interest section’s account and leading to the current suspension of diplomatic services. So while Kerry is asking others in the hemisphere to support his demand for political change in Cuba, U.S. policies are working against the economic, social, and political liberalization that has already taken place.In Miami, the suspension of Cuba’s consular services has reverberated throughout the Cuban-American community, where émigrés have long complained about the Cuban government’s own limitations on their travel to the island. Instead of opening political space for Cuban Americans to press for changes in Cuba’s policy toward emigrants and their families, the U.S. crackdown on Cuban financial transactions crowds out constructive dialogue between the island and its diaspora. Several voices from the Cuban-American community, including Congressman Joe Garcia (D-FL), have advocated for a revision of the current policy.Following Words with ActionsDuring his recent trip to Miami, President Obama spoke about the need for a “more creative” policy toward Cuba. The reforms he has instituted point in the right direction. But they’re not nearly enough. In the prime of his second term, Obama should back up his criticism of the current policy with something far more substantial. It’s time not only for words, but for actual deeds.The State Department has said that it’s trying to find a bank willing to work within the restrictions dictated by its Cuba policy. That’s better than nothing. But Obama should seize the opportunity to take a much bolder step. The United States has not documented Cuban involvement in any terrorist activity in over 20 years. The State Department should therefore remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism — and it should begin to wind down the U.S. embargo, a dinosaur of a policy that dates back to the Cold War.Either of these actions will immediately decrease the financial restrictions that act as disincentives for banks to deal with Cuba. Only then can the acute problem be solved and the long-term effort toward better relations with Cuba be advanced.Issues: Labor, Trade, & FinanceTags: Barack Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Cuba, Cuban Embargo, Cuban interests section, diplomacy, Joe Garcia, John Kerry, M & T Bank, Obama administration, sanctions, state sponsors of terrorism, terrorism list, travel banGet the latest from FPIF in your inbox.View more in Latin America & Caribbean:Dec 11, 2013Dec 5, 2013Foreign Policy In Focus - A project of the Institute for Policy Studies Content under a Creative Commons Attribution licence",1,8,Against,Neutral,Against,0,Against,"['Against', 'Neutral', 'Against']","Should the United States Maintain Its Embargo against Cuba?

Other Americans have been able to engage in new opportunities for cultural and educational exchange.ContradictionsBut the U.S. government’s own policies are frustrating the Obama administration’s stated goals of improving ties with Cuba, closing off even this limited point of contact.The current problems come on the heels of a gradual opening of relations between the two countries. Both President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have recognized the significant positive changes occurring in Cuba and say they want to encourage them. Speaking before the Organization of American States shortly before the consulate closure, Kerry stressed the U.S. commitment to allowing certain travelers and remittances to Cuba. He said U.S. citizens visiting Cuba benefit the country by acting as “ambassadors of our ideals, values, ​​and beliefs.”But throughout the U.S. government, a punitive, Cold-War-era approach to Cuba remains firmly ensconced. The Helms-Burton Act, which beginning in 1996 intensified the U.S. embargo toward Cuba, still restricts visits to and from the island. Moreover, Kerry’s own State Department continually refuses to remove Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, despite providing no reasonable justification for keeping it on.Instead of using taxpayer money to pursue real terrorists, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has stepped up sanctions on financial transactions with Cuba. The policy has caused a panic among banks, leaving them unwilling to risk servicing the Cuban interest section’s account and leading to the current suspension of diplomatic services. So while Kerry is asking others in the hemisphere to support his demand for political change in Cuba, U.S. policies are working against the economic, social, and political liberalization that has already taken place.In Miami, the suspension of Cuba’s consular services has reverberated throughout the Cuban-American community, where émigrés have long complained about the Cuban government’s own limitations on their travel to the island. Instead of opening political space for Cuban Americans to press for changes in Cuba’s policy toward emigrants and their families, the U.S. crackdown on Cuban financial transactions crowds out constructive dialogue between the island and its diaspora. Several voices from the Cuban-American community, including Congressman Joe Garcia (D-FL), have advocated for a revision of the current policy.Following Words with ActionsDuring his recent trip to Miami, President Obama spoke about the need for a “more creative” policy toward Cuba. The reforms he has instituted point in the right direction. But they’re not nearly enough. In the prime of his second term, Obama should back up his criticism of the current policy with something far more substantial. It’s time not only for words, but for actual deeds.The State Department has said that it’s trying to find a bank willing to work within the restrictions dictated by its Cuba policy. That’s better than nothing. But Obama should seize the opportunity to take a much bolder step. The United States has not documented Cuban involvement in any terrorist activity in over 20 years. The State Department should therefore remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism — and it should begin to wind down the U.S. embargo, a dinosaur of a policy that dates back to the Cold War.Either of these actions will immediately decrease the financial restrictions that act as disincentives for banks to deal with Cuba. Only then can the acute problem be solved and the long-term effort toward better relations with Cuba be advanced.Issues: Labor, Trade, & FinanceTags: Barack Obama, Condoleezza Rice, Cuba, Cuban Embargo, Cuban interests section, diplomacy, Joe Garcia, John Kerry, M & T Bank, Obama administration, sanctions, state sponsors of terrorism, terrorism list, travel banGet the latest from FPIF in your inbox.View more in Latin America & Caribbean:Dec 11, 2013Dec 5, 2013Foreign Policy In Focus - A project of the Institute for Policy Studies Content under a Creative Commons Attribution licence",1176,1158
33,Ronald Reagan,Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?,1s33q8r,https://patriotpost.us/opinion/61066-happy-birthday-president-ronald-reagan-your-legacy-is-with-us-even-today,"Kay Coles James: Happy Birthday, President Ronald Reagan — Your Legacy Is With Us, Even Today — The Patriot Post","It has been 30 years since Ronald Reagan left the White House and nearly 15 since he died. As a second generation reaches adulthood since his time in Washington, it is important to remember what he meant to our country and how we still benefit.It was not yet “morning in America” when Reagan took office. His predecessor, Jimmy Carter, talked of a national malaise. The Iranians held American hostages, and OPEC had us over a barrel. Our economy was sclerotic, and America’s foes doubted our national will — our determination to stand up for our interests and principles around the world.Then came Reagan, a man of sunny disposition, can-do attitude and unshakeable belief in the goodness, ingenuity and determination of the American people.His legacy is with us, even today. Communism is all but on the ash heap of history. Its last embers are dying in Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea.Growth and prosperity have returned — thanks to the current administration’s Reaganesque tax cuts and deregulation.Once again, America is pursuing — and achieving — “peace through strength,” rebuilding our worn out military and dealing with ISIS just as the Gipper would have done.Reagan faced no shortage of detractors in his day. Many on the left sought to dismiss him as nothing more than “a B movie actor,” an intellectual lightweight.But those who knew the man knew that was not the case at all.Shortly before the 1988 election, Burton Yale Pines, then the senior vice president of The Heritage Foundation, wrote what he thought would be Reagan’s top legacies. His list proved prophetic. Reagan fulfilled all these predictions:He restored the federal system (though some of his efforts to devolve power to the states were overturned by later administrations).He launched “privatization” of government — a practice that’s still saving taxpayers billions of dollars annually.He appointed judges who respected the Constitution — just as President Trump is doing today.He strengthened a military that been allowed to atrophy and decay — again, an area where Trump has had to follow Reagan’s example.He knew how to deal with the Russians. He proclaimed the Reagan Doctrine — that American would come to the aid of freedom fighters to throw off Soviet tyranny — and ended the Brezhnev Doctrine, which claimed that all socialist countries would fight any effort to introduce capitalism to on their turf.Just as notably, he started the Strategic Defense Initiative, which promised to make nuclear weapons obsolete. We still don’t have a comprehensive missile defense, but Reagan’s initiative wound up making the USSR obsolete. And our continuing advances in missile defense may yet convince the North Korean regime to abandon its nuclear missile program.But Reagan’s legacy extended beyond policy matters. He challenged us to believe in ourselves, not government, to meet our challenges. He talked to Americans about the values we all hold dear — faith and family, work and community, peace and freedom. He urged them to aspire, to be creative and heroic and forward-thinking.And he gave voice to a healthy skepticism about the notion that Washington can solve all the nation’s problems. “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.” Reagan said that in 1986, and it’s still being talked about.A liberal Washington Post columnist recently complained that America’s “core problem is a dogmatic antigovernment attitude, reflected in Reagan’s quip. … This makes it impossible for us to have a constructive debate about what government is for, what tasks it should take on and what good it actually does.”Actually, without Reagan, there might be no debate at all.And without Reagan, the Soviet Union — in all its menacing malevolence — might yet exist. It was he who correctly assessed its economic and social vulnerabilities and saw a chance to end its reign of terror and tyranny.Without Reagan, the notion that cutting taxes can lead to more growth, more prosperity and even more government revenue — the notion guiding our current economic resurgence — might never have been attempted.Without Reagan, America’s place in the world — as the pre-eminent superpower no nation dares take on in a conventional war — might not be secure.As Pines noted in his essay, the 1970s was not a good time for America. Many doubted we could recover.Ronald Reagan changed all that with commonsense policies, his unshakable faith in American ideals and the American people, and with boundless optimism.

6,Abortion,Should Abortion Be Legal?,1s6q5r,https://rightsinfo.org/bbc-abortion-row-why-reproductive-rights-should-never-be-contentious/,BBC Abortion Row: Why Reproductive Rights Should Never Be 'Contentious' - RightsInfo,"By Jenn Selby 198 SharesThe BBC found itself in the midst of controversy last week after it refused to include advice about abortion as part of its advice service because it believed it was a “contentious issue”.The information on accessing terminations in the UK, and what those procedures entail, should have featured as part of the broadcaster’s Action Line following an episode of Call The Midwife on 3 February that featured a character dying from a backstreet abortion.However, the BBC’s decision, originally intended so the “impartial” organisation did not “take a particular stance”, was widely criticised.Not least because abortion comes under reproductive rights, recognised as human rights not just by the European Court of Human Rights, but also by the United Nations (further information on this below).The broadcaster has since reneged, and included a link to NHS guidance on abortion via its website in all UK nations bar Northern Ireland, where having an abortion still can still carry a potential sentence of lifelong imprisonment under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 (OAPA).In a statement on Sunday, a spokesperson for the BBC said: “Our original letter, in response to a complaint on this issue, didn’t characterise our position correctly, but we have updated the website to provide a link now.”Even so, the apparent lapse of judgement continues to be countered and critiqued, not least by Government ministers and reproductive rights services.According to the Sunday Times, Women and Equalities Minister, Penny Mordaunt and Health Minister, Jackie Doyle-Price, wrote to the BBC to complain about its choice.Nearly 100 MPs also signed a letter sent to BBC director general Lord Hall criticising the decision to “withhold information about women’s reproductive healthcare services which have been legal and have been part of the NHS for over 50 years”.The letter reads: “By citing an issue as ‘contentious’, it [appears] any regressive and vocal minority could exercise a veto, and effective editorial control, over BBC content — at the expense of health, welfare and human rights of women in often the most vulnerable position.”The BBC is in effect ‘supporting one side’ by treating abortion as different to all the other medical procedures [it] chooses to include.Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also expressed its concern in a letter.It wrote that abortion is a “routine part of NHS-funded healthcare” that is provided by doctors, nurses and midwives in England, Scotland and Wales every day.“The BBC is in effect ‘supporting one side’ by treating abortion as different to all the other medical procedures [it] chooses to include,” it read.There is also some praise for the BBC’s U-turn on its decision.Speaking to RightsInfo, a spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said: “We are very pleased that the BBC has now recognised that refusing to provide information about a medical procedure that one in three women will undergo in their lifetime, was completely the wrong decision to take. In doing so, they were taking a political stance on a healthcare issue, and we welcome this reversal.“The outpouring of support from the public, MPs, and government ministers has made it abundantly clear that abortion is not contentious, and that access to abortion care and information is not just accepted in our society, it is expected.”Also known as a termination, an abortion it is the medical process of ending a pregnancy so that it doesn’t result in the birth of a baby.This is achieved by taking medication or by undertaking a minor surgical procedure.The decision to undergo an abortion is an important and often difficult one which requires support, both physically and mentally, for any woman who experiences the procedure.According to the NHS, one in three women will have an abortion during their lifetime.Partially: in England, Scotland and Wales, women can’t access abortion as easily as they can in the (newly legal) Republic of Ireland and in much of Europe.Under the Abortion Act 1967, women are granted abortions only in certain circumstances; circumstances which must be approved by two separate doctors before they can have access to a legal and safe termination.There are five categories under which abortion in England, Scotland and Wales is permissible.This includes where the mother’s life is in danger (Category A) and foetal abnormalities (Category E).There is also Category C, an exemption that allows termination if the mother can prove that the pregnancy and childbirth would damage her mental health. A huge 98 per cent of all abortions are permitted under this category.Campaigners for reproductive rights want the law, which is now over 50 years old and was intended only as interim legislation to negate the OAPA 1861 before a more comprehensive law could be introduced, to be updated to allow women to be able to have an abortion when they require one without having to seek approval.In Northern Ireland, women can still face imprisonment for having an abortion. Whilst Northern Irish women can now access free abortions in England under a recent change to the law and can apply for a hardship fund to allow for travel and accommodation required when making the trip, they will receive no physical or mental support for their experience upon their return to Northern Ireland.Not only does this risk the health of the expectant mother by forcing her to travel, often alone, at a particularly vulnerable time, but the financial implications of last-minute flights and accommodation create a class bias for women that require an abortion within Northern Ireland.With many politicians and women’s rights activists demanding for decades that safe and legal access to abortions is a human right that should be afforded equally to all citizens of the UK, Stella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow, has recently been a vocal parliamentary advocate on this issue.“The Republic of Ireland may have voted with an overwhelming majority to remove the ban on abortion but women in Northern Ireland are still criminalised by cruel and outdated Westminster laws,” she tells RightsInfo.In 2019 we will be redoubling our fight against this injustice and seeking to amend legislation.She added that the collapse of the power-sharing agreement at Stormont, the devolved Northern Irish Assembly, two years ago “cannot be used as an excuse not to act on this basic human rights issue”.“In 2019, we will be redoubling our fight against this injustice and seeking to amend legislation to decriminalise abortion across the UK, including in Northern Ireland. Whatever deals the PM does with the DUP to stay in power, we will not rest until abortion is free, safe, legal and local for every UK citizen.”A cross-party group of MPs, including Creasey, sent a letter to the Joint Committee for Human Rights on Friday demanding that the issue of abortion in Northern Ireland be tackled as part of the upcoming Domestic Violence Bill.The intention of the Domestic Violence Bill was to bring the law in line with the government’s commitment to ratifying the Istanbul Convention – the gold standard in legislation to tackle violence against women and girls in all forms.According to the United Nations, “women’s sexual and reproductive health is related to multiple human rights, including the right to life, the right to be free from torture, the right to health, the right to privacy, the right to education, and the prohibition of discrimination.“The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) have both clearly indicated that women’s right to health includes their sexual and reproductive health. This means that States have obligations to respect, protect and fulfil rights related to women’s sexual and reproductive health.”We hope that this year will mark the end of inhumane and degrading treatment of UK citizens.This is echoed under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act, which states that an individual has the right to respect for their family and private life, home and correspondence.“Abortion is a human right – one which is still denied to many women here in the UK,” a spokesperson for BPAS tells RightsInfo.“In 2018, the Supreme Court found that the current near-total ban on abortion in Northern Ireland is in breach of Article 8, right to a private and family life, of the European Convention on Human Rights.“We hope that this year will mark the end of this inhumane and degrading treatment of UK citizens and that MPs decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland and across Great Britain.”Help us increase understanding and support for human rights in the UK.198 Shares - Help spread accurate information about human rights by sharing this siteTens of thousands of people in the UK are being held indefinitely, with no idea when they'll be released, or what will happen next.

13,Standardized Tests,Is the Use of Standardized Tests Improving Education in America?,1s13q10r,http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/reimagining/2013/08/whats_the_goal_of_edu.html,What is the Goal of the American Education System? - Reimagining K-12 - Education Week,"When we discuss the uses of technology in the classroom, the conversation inevitably turns to the theme of reform within the education system. The two concepts are conceivably joined at the hip, two peas in a pod: Ed-Tech = Ed-Reform. I don't think this is quite right. For me, introducing technology into the classroom has various use cases (automating administrative processes for teachers to free up more time for real teaching, creating richer content-based experiences, connecting local students to the entirety of the world around them) that add up to something more akin to the modernization of the learning experience. Advanced technologies are increasingly becoming commonplace within the pure act of surviving in the 21st Century. Reform, however, has more to do with the learning experience itself. What should we be teaching? How do we think about accountability? How do we balance standards with the complexities of population diversity? Undoubtedly, technology is typically an offshoot of this dialogue, a tool through which much of this reform can be delivered and administered. But they are not the same thing. Reform is a big fancy buzzword that floats around one particular concept: what are we trying to get out of this educational experience, and how do we adjust the current system to reflect these changes? In the United States education system, we have kids under our control until they are 18 years old. By the time they are 18, what is it that we would like them to have accomplished and be positioned to accomplish in the future? Before any logical debate can take place regarding reform, we first need to determine what the point of public education is in the first place. It seems obvious on the surface, but my guess is the deeper we delve into this narrative, the more differentiated the opinions will be. Are we trying to produce happy adults? Are we trying to produce the next generation workforce? Are we trying to produce active, informed citizens capable of navigating a complex democracy? Perhaps simply ""college readiness?"" Are we simply trying to ""beat"" China (or South Korea, or Finland, or whoever)? Is it something in between? So, I decided to ping an array of informed voices on this very subject and compile a set of responses from these diverse individuals within the education world. I asked two questions: In your opinion, what is the current goal of the American Public Education System? and.. What should be the goal of the American Public Education System? Here are some of the responses I have gathered so far (more to come in Part II). By all means, please feel free to contribute your own thoughts in the comments section below, or even shoot me an email for potential use in the followups to come: From Paul Smith, Head of Marketing at LearnSprout, former Fourth Grade teacher In your opinion, what is the current goal of the American Public Education System? Over the last thirteen years since NCLB the American education system has shifted away from the broad goal of preparing students for life, to the specific goal of preparing students for college. What should be the goal of the American Public Education System? I've typed and deleted and typed and deleted my answer here... The answer to this question should be simple, but it's not. I'm not sure if it's wise to have a singular goal for public education since we know from experience that diversity has been the key to our success. That being said, I think it would be wise for us to establish a national mission statement. We recently went through this exercise for LearnSprout and the process revealed a great deal. It invoked deep, prolonged late-night discussions and many beers were consumed. It forced us to reflect on what our combined strengths were and revealed discrepancies in our individual aspirations for the company. Through the process we ultimately landed on something that serves as a constant touchstone and influences every decision we make. This is the conversation we should be having about education in the U.S. Instead we're lost in the weeds, arguing about tactics without a strategy or mission. (The US DOE has their own but it doesn't speak to the purpose of public education.) Wouldn't it be great to have folks like Arne Duncan, Diane Ravitch, Sugata Mitra, Ken Robinson, Michelle Rhee, Geoffrey Canada and Randi Weingarten all on a joint task force to take on this question and come up with a mission statement we all could agree with? Perhaps that's naive on my part, but it's worth a shot IMO. Here's my attempt: To develop in all students the core knowledge requisite for an independent life. To help students realize and develop their strengths while improving upon their weaknesses. To help students understand our commonality while celebrating individualism. To develop respect for history and tradition while cultivating a shared desire to challenge the status quo. To cultivate divergent thinking instill a creative spirit. To engender a sense of patriotism, balanced with a global world view. From Matt Greenfield, Managing Partner of Rethink Education, former Professor of English at Bowdoin College and the CUNY system 1. I think most Americans would agree with me that the goal of the American public education system is to prepare students to be responsible, healthy, engaged, self-aware citizens and experts in the performance of a socially useful task. We disagree about how to achieve this goal. 2. I think the goal does not need to be changed. I do think, though, that the system needs modify its methods: learning needs to be more personalized, more active, more collaborative, more global, and more closely tied to the passions and expertise of students. Technology can help us get there, not by replacing teachers but by freeing teachers to spend more time with small groups and individual students. One-on-one instruction will continue to be the gold standard in education. From Allison McKinnon, K/1 teacher in the Greater Rochester public school system I believe the current goal of the american public education system is to raise the academic standards in the United States through the implementation of the common core standards. The belief is, by raising standards and helping students develop critical thinking skills, students will achieve greater academic success and perform better on standardized tests, ultimately raising the United States educational ranking in the world. Unfortunately, the increased frequency of poor quality standardized assessments does not truly reflect student achievement and cognitive ability. The goal should be to provide teachers with high quality professional development to implement the common core in a dynamic an interactive manner and not rely on standardized tests to rank students, teachers, schools, districts and states. From John Katzman, founder of The Princeton Review, 2U, and Noodle.org, regarding the second question To turn out students who, over the next 30 years, are economic successes, good citizens, and happy people. Each of those things is highly measurable, and any short-term metric that doesn't durably predict those long term metrics is worthless. From Peter Mili, 2013 NEA Foundation Massachusetts Teacher of Excellence and a Pearson Foundation 2013 Global Learning Fellow In your opinion, what is the current goal of the American Public Education System? What should be the goal of the American Public Education System? I'd say there is a fair amount of consensus with this partial list, that our American Public Education System should strive towards in educating our students to • be prepared to participate in our democracy, • be responsible citizens, • acquire '21st century skills', • be globally competent, • think critically, • read and write, • and be quantitatively literate. As a practitioner, I'm fearful, along with many colleagues, that these goals and all that is involved in achieving them is currently being compromised by the policies of accountability and undesirable consequences that are in place. One result is that what happens in schools is to focus on what is easily measured by the assessments for 'accountability' such as (arithmetic, spelling, comprehension), at the expense of other skills and understandings that are not easily measured (such as responsibility, collaboration, global competence, critical thinking). From Betty Bardige, Early Childhood Consultant, Author & Advocate Today, the central aim of our public education system seems to be: To prepare (some) students to succeed in the worlds of work and continuing (higher) education. (I said ""some"" because our system is not equitable.) In a democracy, the central aim of public education needs to be to create an informed, involved, critically-thoughtful citizenry committed to the long-term welfare of the community and the collective pursuit of a just, healthy, and inclusive society. In a country that is founded upon the shared value of equal opportunity, all children must have access to an education that enables them to be full and productive participants in civic, social, economic, and community life. In today's world, that means promoting global knowledge, cross-cultural communication and competence, wide-ranging curiosity, and the ability to use a variety of technologies to continue to develop knowledge, expertise, and new perspectives and to actively participate in knowledge creation and civic discourse. It also means building emotional as well as cognitive intelligence. The Common Core, which promotes critical and creative thinking, deep content knowledge, analytic and problem-solving skills, and effective communication in a variety of forms and contexts From a child's perspective, the aim of education is to engender and satisfy curiosity and to build the knowledge and skill needed for self-chosen individual and collaborative pursuits. At the Mailman-Segal Institute for Early Childhood Studies, the preschool curriculum is based on 5 ""c's: communication, cooperation, creativity, concept development, and critical thinking. The curriculum incorporates other important c's as well: culture, community, curiosity, content knowledge (in a wide range of areas that interest children), and coping strategies, along with the ongoing development of physical competence and health-promoting habits. That's a pretty good list of educational aims. We've built our education system upside down, with narrow ""college and career ready"" aims and easily tested skills at the top driving and often crowding out the broader ""whole child"" aims that - according to extensive research - are actually critical to achieving college and career readiness. Ellen Galinsky's book, Mind in the Making, summarizes these ""seven essential life skills:"" focus and self-control, perspective-taking, communicating, making connections, critical thinking, taking on challenges, and self-directed, engaged learning. Several years ago, I participated in a conference on ""Quality Education as a Civil Right,"" convened by the Algebra Project, the Young People's Project, and Howard University. The conference brought together educators (pre-K - 12), academics, civil rights activists, and students from across the U.S.. There was a surprising amount of consensus among the various groups as to what constituted a ""quality education."" Although they used different words, all groups called for an approach that balanced building knowledge and skills needed to obtain satisfying work at good wages with opportunities to pursue individual passions and curiosity and a values-based commitment to community responsibility and social justice.",1,10,Not-about,Not-about,Against,0,Not-about,"['Not-about', 'Not-about', 'Against']","Is the Use of Standardized Tests Improving Education in America?

One-on-one instruction will continue to be the gold standard in education. From Allison McKinnon, K/1 teacher in the Greater Rochester public school system I believe the current goal of the american public education system is to raise the academic standards in the United States through the implementation of the common core standards. The belief is, by raising standards and helping students develop critical thinking skills, students will achieve greater academic success and perform better on standardized tests, ultimately raising the United States educational ranking in the world. Unfortunately, the increased frequency of poor quality standardized assessments does not truly reflect student achievement and cognitive ability. The goal should be to provide teachers with high quality professional development to implement the common core in a dynamic an interactive manner and not rely on standardized tests to rank students, teachers, schools, districts and states. From John Katzman, founder of The Princeton Review, 2U, and Noodle.org, regarding the second question To turn out students who, over the next 30 years, are economic successes, good citizens, and happy people. Each of those things is highly measurable, and any short-term metric that doesn't durably predict those long term metrics is worthless. From Peter Mili, 2013 NEA Foundation Massachusetts Teacher of Excellence and a Pearson Foundation 2013 Global Learning Fellow In your opinion, what is the current goal of the American Public Education System? What should be the goal of the American Public Education System? I'd say there is a fair amount of consensus with this partial list, that our American Public Education System should strive towards in educating our students to • be prepared to participate in our democracy, • be responsible citizens, • acquire '21st century skills', • be globally competent, • think critically, • read and write, • and be quantitatively literate. As a practitioner, I'm fearful, along with many colleagues, that these goals and all that is involved in achieving them is currently being compromised by the policies of accountability and undesirable consequences that are in place. One result is that what happens in schools is to focus on what is easily measured by the assessments for 'accountability' such as (arithmetic, spelling, comprehension), at the expense of other skills and understandings that are not easily measured (such as responsibility, collaboration, global competence, critical thinking). From Betty Bardige, Early Childhood Consultant, Author & Advocate Today, the central aim of our public education system seems to be: To prepare (some) students to succeed in the worlds of work and continuing (higher) education. (I said ""some"" because our system is not equitable.) In a democracy, the central aim of public education needs to be to create an informed, involved, critically-thoughtful citizenry committed to the long-term welfare of the community and the collective pursuit of a just, healthy, and inclusive society. In a country that is founded upon the shared value of equal opportunity, all children must have access to an education that enables them to be full and productive participants in civic, social, economic, and community life. In today's world, that means promoting global knowledge, cross-cultural communication and competence, wide-ranging curiosity, and the ability to use a variety of technologies to continue to develop knowledge, expertise, and new perspectives and to actively participate in knowledge creation and civic discourse. It also means building emotional as well as cognitive intelligence. The Common Core, which promotes critical and creative thinking, deep content knowledge, analytic and problem-solving skills, and effective communication in a variety of forms and contexts From a child's perspective, the aim of education is to engender and satisfy curiosity and to build the knowledge and skill needed for self-chosen individual and collaborative pursuits. At the Mailman-Segal Institute for Early Childhood Studies, the preschool curriculum is based on 5 ""c's: communication, cooperation, creativity, concept development, and critical thinking. The curriculum incorporates other important c's as well: culture, community, curiosity, content knowledge (in a wide range of areas that interest children), and coping strategies, along with the ongoing development of physical competence and health-promoting habits. That's a pretty good list of educational aims. We've built our education system upside down, with narrow ""college and career ready"" aims and easily tested skills at the top driving and often crowding out the broader ""whole child"" aims that - according to extensive research - are actually critical to achieving college and career readiness. Ellen Galinsky's book, Mind in the Making, summarizes these ""seven essential life skills:"" focus and self-control, perspective-taking, communicating, making connections, critical thinking, taking on challenges, and self-directed, engaged learning. Several years ago, I participated in a conference on ""Quality Education as a Civil Right,"" convened by the Algebra Project, the Young People's Project, and Howard University. The conference brought together educators (pre-K - 12), academics, civil rights activists, and students from across the U.S.. There was a surprising amount of consensus among the various groups as to what constituted a ""quality education."" Although they used different words, all groups called for an approach that balanced building knowledge and skills needed to obtain satisfying work at good wages with opportunities to pursue individual passions and curiosity and a values-based commitment to community responsibility and social justice.",1860,1835

Read on for an overview of what it is and when it began, as well as why and when it was removed.Although no government currently uses the gold standard, it is important to examine its historical roots to get a better understanding of how the current economic landscape came to be. From its introduction in the 1800s to its complete removal in 1971, the pros and cons of the gold standard have been widely debated, with whispers that President Donald Trump is interested in bringing it back to the United States. Read on for an overview of the gold standard is and when it began, as well as why and when it was removed and what it was replaced with. The gold standard is a monetary system where the value of a country’s currency is directly linked to the yellow metal. When countries used the gold standard, a fixed price at which to buy and sell gold was set as a way to determine the value of their currency.For example, if the US went back to the gold standard and set the price of gold at US$500 per ounce, the value of the dollar would be 1/500th of an ounce of gold. This offers reliable price stability. The gold standard was appealing to many countries as they were searching for ways to standardize transactions in the bustling world trade market. With the gold standard in place, these countries were able to guarantee that the government would redeem any amount of paper money for its value in gold. Additionally, by introducing the gold standard, transactions were no longer required to be done with heavy gold bullion or coins. It also increased the trust needed for successful global trade ― paper currency finally had value that was tied to something real. Other advantages of the gold standard were that it limited the power of governments or banks to cause price inflation by excessive issue of paper currency, while also creating certainty in international trade by providing a fixed pattern of exchange rates.The goal of this monetary policy was to prevent inflation, but also deflation, and to help promote a stable monetary environment. In 1821, the United Kingdom became the first country to adopt the gold standard. Prior to this time, silver had been the main world monetary metal, while the yellow metal was used intermittently for coinage in one or another country, but never as the standard, to which all other forms of currency were coordinated or adjusted. By the 1870s, Germany took on a monometallic gold standard and as of 1900 the US and several other countries followed suit. This shift in various other countries adopting the gold standard came when gold discoveries in western North America at the time had made gold more plentiful. In the full gold standard that thus prevailed until 1914, gold could be bought or sold in unlimited quantities at a fixed price in convertible paper money per unit weight of the metal.In 1913, Congress created the Federal Reserve with the hopes of stabilizing both gold and currency values. Unfortunately, before it could fully get running, World War I broke out.With the war in fully swing, European countries made the decision to suspend the gold standard in order to print enough money to pay for their military involvement. Unfortunately, printing money created hyperinflation.After the war, countries realized the value of tying their currency to a guaranteed value in gold most countries returned to a modified gold standard.By 1928, the gold standard was reestablished, with small changes to reflect the relative scarcity of gold.During this time, most nations adopted a gold-exchange standard, in which they supplemented their central-bank gold reserves with currencies (US dollars and British pounds) that were convertible into gold at a stable rate of exchange. The US took the new gold standard into its own hands and decided to set a new minimum dollar price for gold to be used for purchases and sales by foreign central banks. This action by the US was known as “pegging” the price of gold, and acted as the basis for the restoration of an international gold standard after World War II; in this postwar system most exchange rates were pegged either to the US dollar or to the yellow metal. The gold-exchange standard collapsed again during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and by 1937 not a single country remained on the full gold standard.The gold standard was largely abandoned in an effort to combat the lingering effects of the Great Depression. The United States in particular decided to make the move away from gold because the country was facing both mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation. In the early 1930s, the US government was unable to do much to stimulate the economy and believed that it needed to deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply. In response to a lackluster economy, the US Federal Reserve and several other governments kept raising interest rates in an attempt to make dollars more valuable and dissuade people from further depleting the US gold reserves. These higher rates worsened the Depression by making the cost of doing business more expensive. Many companies went bankrupt, creating record levels of unemployment.In order to rectify the damage done by surging interest rates, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the US dollar’s ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy while lowering interest rates.“Most economists now agree 90 percent of the reason why the US got out of the Great Depression was the break with gold,” said Liaquat Ahamed, author of the book Lords of Finance.Despite breaking free from the gold standard, the US continued to allow foreign governments to exchange dollars for the yellow metal until 1971. However, during that year fading gold reserves and a mounting deficit in its balance of payments eventually led the US suspending the free convertibility of dollars into gold at fixed rates of exchange for use in international payments.That’s when President Richard Nixon realized he was putting a stop to dollar-flush foreigners from being able partake in these exchanges as he believed that they were depleting US gold reserves.The demise of the gold standard began as World War II was coming to an end. At this time, the leading Western powers met to develop the Bretton Woods agreement, which would be the framework for the global currency markets until 1971. Benton Woods was developed at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, from July 1 to July 22, 1944. Under the agreement, currencies were pegged to the price of gold, and the US dollar was seen as a reserve currency linked to the price of gold. This meant that all national currencies were valued in relation to the US dollar, since it had become a dominant reserve currency. In turn, the greenback, was convertible to gold at the fixed rate of US$35 per ounce. The global financial system continued to operate upon a gold standard, in a far more indirect manner.Despite the valiant attempts made by the governments involved during this time, the Bretton Woods agreement led to overvaluation of the US dollar, which led to concerns over the exchange rates and their tie to the price of gold.By 1971, Nixon called for a temporary suspension of the dollar’s convertibility. Countries were then free to choose any exchange agreement, except the price of gold. In 1973, foreign governments let currencies float, which put an end to the Bretton Woods system and any trace of the gold standard was abolished. From the 1970s to today, most countries run on a system of fiat money, which the glossary defines as “money that is intrinsically useless; is used only as a medium of exchange.” The value of money is set by the supply and demand for paper money and the supply and demand for other goods and services in the economy. The prices for those goods and services, including gold and silver, can fluctuate based on market conditions.While it is not widely addressed, Trump is a fan of the gold standard and often times has been caught praising it. In an often-quoted 2015 GQ interview, Trump says about the system: “[b]ringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful. We’d have a standard on which to base our money.” In a separate interview from the same year he also stated, “[w]e used to have a very, very solid country because it was based on a gold standard.”However, despite the US President’s penchant for the yellow metal as a currency standard, the chance that the gold standard will re-emerge anytime soon are slim. In fact, according to the Motley Fool’s Sean Williams, most economists agree that moving to a lower-key version of the gold standard in 1933 “was a big reason why the US emerged from the Great Depression,” and believe that a return “would be a mistake.”Don’t forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time news updates!Securities Disclosure: I, Nicole Rashotte, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.We have limited the number of investor kits you can request to 20.Please remember that by requesting an investor kit, you are giving permission for those companies to contact you using whatever contact information you provide.

This shift in various other countries adopting the gold standard came when gold discoveries in western North America at the time had made gold more plentiful. In the full gold standard that thus prevailed until 1914, gold could be bought or sold in unlimited quantities at a fixed price in convertible paper money per unit weight of the metal.In 1913, Congress created the Federal Reserve with the hopes of stabilizing both gold and currency values. Unfortunately, before it could fully get running, World War I broke out.With the war in fully swing, European countries made the decision to suspend the gold standard in order to print enough money to pay for their military involvement. Unfortunately, printing money created hyperinflation.After the war, countries realized the value of tying their currency to a guaranteed value in gold most countries returned to a modified gold standard.By 1928, the gold standard was reestablished, with small changes to reflect the relative scarcity of gold.During this time, most nations adopted a gold-exchange standard, in which they supplemented their central-bank gold reserves with currencies (US dollars and British pounds) that were convertible into gold at a stable rate of exchange. The US took the new gold standard into its own hands and decided to set a new minimum dollar price for gold to be used for purchases and sales by foreign central banks. This action by the US was known as “pegging” the price of gold, and acted as the basis for the restoration of an international gold standard after World War II; in this postwar system most exchange rates were pegged either to the US dollar or to the yellow metal. The gold-exchange standard collapsed again during the Great Depression of the 1930s, and by 1937 not a single country remained on the full gold standard.The gold standard was largely abandoned in an effort to combat the lingering effects of the Great Depression. The United States in particular decided to make the move away from gold because the country was facing both mounting unemployment and spiraling deflation. In the early 1930s, the US government was unable to do much to stimulate the economy and believed that it needed to deter people from cashing in deposits and depleting the gold supply. In response to a lackluster economy, the US Federal Reserve and several other governments kept raising interest rates in an attempt to make dollars more valuable and dissuade people from further depleting the US gold reserves. These higher rates worsened the Depression by making the cost of doing business more expensive. Many companies went bankrupt, creating record levels of unemployment.In order to rectify the damage done by surging interest rates, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt cut the US dollar’s ties with gold, allowing the government to pump money into the economy while lowering interest rates.“Most economists now agree 90 percent of the reason why the US got out of the Great Depression was the break with gold,” said Liaquat Ahamed, author of the book Lords of Finance.Despite breaking free from the gold standard, the US continued to allow foreign governments to exchange dollars for the yellow metal until 1971. However, during that year fading gold reserves and a mounting deficit in its balance of payments eventually led the US suspending the free convertibility of dollars into gold at fixed rates of exchange for use in international payments.That’s when President Richard Nixon realized he was putting a stop to dollar-flush foreigners from being able partake in these exchanges as he believed that they were depleting US gold reserves.The demise of the gold standard began as World War II was coming to an end. At this time, the leading Western powers met to develop the Bretton Woods agreement, which would be the framework for the global currency markets until 1971. Benton Woods was developed at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference held in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, from July 1 to July 22, 1944. Under the agreement, currencies were pegged to the price of gold, and the US dollar was seen as a reserve currency linked to the price of gold. This meant that all national currencies were valued in relation to the US dollar, since it had become a dominant reserve currency. In turn, the greenback, was convertible to gold at the fixed rate of US$35 per ounce. The global financial system continued to operate upon a gold standard, in a far more indirect manner.Despite the valiant attempts made by the governments involved during this time, the Bretton Woods agreement led to overvaluation of the US dollar, which led to concerns over the exchange rates and their tie to the price of gold.By 1971, Nixon called for a temporary suspension of the dollar’s convertibility. Countries were then free to choose any exchange agreement, except the price of gold. In 1973, foreign governments let currencies float, which put an end to the Bretton Woods system and any trace of the gold standard was abolished. From the 1970s to today, most countries run on a system of fiat money, which the glossary defines as “money that is intrinsically useless; is used only as a medium of exchange.” The value of money is set by the supply and demand for paper money and the supply and demand for other goods and services in the economy. The prices for those goods and services, including gold and silver, can fluctuate based on market conditions.While it is not widely addressed, Trump is a fan of the gold standard and often times has been caught praising it. In an often-quoted 2015 GQ interview, Trump says about the system: “[b]ringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do, but boy, would it be wonderful. We’d have a standard on which to base our money.” In a separate interview from the same year he also stated, “[w]e used to have a very, very solid country because it was based on a gold standard.”However, despite the US President’s penchant for the yellow metal as a currency standard, the chance that the gold standard will re-emerge anytime soon are slim. In fact, according to the Motley Fool’s Sean Williams, most economists agree that moving to a lower-key version of the gold standard in 1933 “was a big reason why the US emerged from the Great Depression,” and believe that a return “would be a mistake.”Don’t forget to follow us @INN_Resource for real-time news updates!Securities Disclosure: I, Nicole Rashotte, hold no direct investment interest in any company mentioned in this article.We have limited the number of investor kits you can request to 20.Please remember that by requesting an investor kit, you are giving permission for those companies to contact you using whatever contact information you provide.

A new national survey from the Cleveland Clinic shows that Americans, by and large, are concerned about their weight and worried about heart disease. But are they doing something about it? That's another story. More than 70 percent of the roughly 1,000 adults surveyed said they were worried about their weight, but less than half had made changes to their diet in order to lose weight. And carrying those extra pounds is putting them in jeopardy of serious health problems.  But many Americans aren't making the connection between obesity and serious diseases. Nearly 90 percent don't know that obesity is linked to cancer, more than half don't know it's linked to high cholesterol and heart disease, and two-thirds don't know it's tied to stroke. ""We have an education gap,"" said Cleveland Clinic physician Dr. Steven Nissen. ""We have an epidemic, people know it's a problem, but they really don't know what to do about it."" The good news is that even a little bit of weight loss — such as 5 percent of body weight — can make a big difference in overall health, says Nissen. But be careful how you share this news with friends and family, as more than half of Americans — and even more baby boomers — do not want others telling them to lose weight because they already know they should.  ideastream intern William Kovach created the graph for this story.A national report released Monday shows Ohio has the 11th highest obesity rate in the country.In the past few years, consumer advocacy groups have pressed restaurant chains to offer healthier kids' meals and more nutritious side options like milk and fruit, and the restaurants have responded.

Read the second part here.Obesity levels in Australia and around the world are high and rising. This comes at an enormous economic cost for society and individuals, not only in terms of health care and productivity, but also in lost quality and duration of life.Both behavioural economics research and weight-loss trials show that relying solely on Australians to take personal responsibility is doomed to fail, unless governments step in to create environments that promote healthy food and physical activity.There is plenty of evidence to show obesity is not simply an individual choice. The failure of the unregulated market to deliver societally optimal outcomes calls for government intervention through regulation, taxes and subsidies, to create environments that make the healthy choice the easy choice.An emphasis on the need for “personal responsibility” often comes with a rejection of the need for government action. In 2004, for example, the then prime minister, John Howard, rejected a plan to ban fast food advertising during children’s television programs, saying it would “take responsibility away from parents”. But there are a few requirements for someone to control their weight: First, let’s examine that last element – can well-informed individuals who want to lose weight succeed? Some can, and some do. But I have met obese dietitians, and I don’t think they chose to be as heavy as they were. Some of the world’s top obesity experts are also overweight. Clearly, knowledge alone is not enough to keep a healthy weight. So, why is it so difficult for many individuals to keep the weight off?In his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman discusses a range of cognitive biases that hinder rational decision-making. Kahneman argues that most of our daily decisions are made in an instant, without reflection. But experiments also show that contextual cues influence us much more than we realise. In one study Kahneman cites, participants were asked to estimate how old Gandhi was when he died. They gave a much higher estimate when the previous question was whether he was older or younger than 114 years, compared to if the prompt was 35 years. Marketing experts also know this – advertising works. In short, the environment in which we live has a large impact on what we eat and how much we move. Our personal choices are bounded choices and not entirely rational. Studies of the long-term success of weight-loss interventions confirm this. One year after the end of diet and exercise interventions, about half of the weight loss has been regained. It seems likely that all weight is back on in about 5.5 years. The participants in such studies are well motivated and excellently informed, and it seems unlikely they changed their minds about wanting to be lean. So, in all likelihood, they were unable to sustain the behaviours required for it.In 2016 alone, Australia lost an estimated 447,839 healthy life years due to high body mass. This is 8.3% of the total burden of disease in Australia.But this isn’t the cost of personal responsibility. High obesity rates are not the result of a deliberate trade-off, where people choose to accept obesity as an acceptable price for the unhealthy food choices and low physical activity levels they favour. This is confirmed by the fact that obese people tend to report a lower quality of life than lean people. Instead, obesity is a result of environments that lead to these behaviours. Insisting on “personal choice” as a solution will have limited success unless we make it easier to eat more healthily and be more active.In an environment that stimulates the consumption of unhealthy food and discourages physical activity, many people are unable to stick to the behaviours needed to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. This means there is scope for the government to get involved and, for example, tax unhealthy foods and subsidise nutritious ones.

Gretchen Whitmer has signed a directive that enters the state into the U.S. Climate Alliance. The U.S. Climate Alliance is considered a bipartisan coalition of governors from 19 states (now 20) that have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. READ: What is the Paris climate accord? ""(We've) got to take action to protect our state from the effects of climate change. The science is in, and it’s time we get to work to mitigate the impact of climate change for the sake of our kids and future generations in Michigan,"" reads a statement from Whitmer. Whitmer's ""Executive Directive 2019 - 12"" reads as follows: The Fourth National Climate Assessment issued in November of 2018 by the federal government indicated that the earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The Climate Assessment concluded: The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States, including Michigan, and are projected to intensify in the future. Climate change is lowering water tables in the Great Lakes Basin, decreasing total wetland area in Michigan, and stimulating algae blooms. The severity of future impacts of climate change will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. Unfortunately for Michigan’s future, the federal government has retreated from such action, and withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement entered into by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12, 2015 (the “Paris Agreement”). If the federal government will not respond to climate change, Michigan must. A bipartisan coalition of governors from 19 other states has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement by forming the United States Climate Alliance. Smart, coordinated state action can ensure that the United States continues to contribute to the global effort to address climate change. States leading the United States Climate Alliance recognize that climate change presents a serious threat to the environment and our residents, communities, and economy. Alliance participants are growing clean energy economies and creating new jobs, while reducing air pollution, improving public health, and building more resilient communities. Despite the U.S. federal government’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Alliance members are committed to supporting the international agreement, and are pursuing climate action to make progress toward its goals. It is time for Michigan to join the effort. Acting pursuant to sections 1 and 8 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, I direct the following: As chief executive officer, I commit the State of Michigan to: This directive is effective immediately.

The science is in, and it’s time we get to work to mitigate the impact of climate change for the sake of our kids and future generations in Michigan,"" reads a statement from Whitmer. Whitmer's ""Executive Directive 2019 - 12"" reads as follows: The Fourth National Climate Assessment issued in November of 2018 by the federal government indicated that the earth’s climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities. The Climate Assessment concluded: The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States, including Michigan, and are projected to intensify in the future. Climate change is lowering water tables in the Great Lakes Basin, decreasing total wetland area in Michigan, and stimulating algae blooms. The severity of future impacts of climate change will depend largely on actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. Unfortunately for Michigan’s future, the federal government has retreated from such action, and withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement entered into by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12, 2015 (the “Paris Agreement”). If the federal government will not respond to climate change, Michigan must. A bipartisan coalition of governors from 19 other states has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement by forming the United States Climate Alliance. Smart, coordinated state action can ensure that the United States continues to contribute to the global effort to address climate change. States leading the United States Climate Alliance recognize that climate change presents a serious threat to the environment and our residents, communities, and economy. Alliance participants are growing clean energy economies and creating new jobs, while reducing air pollution, improving public health, and building more resilient communities. Despite the U.S. federal government’s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Alliance members are committed to supporting the international agreement, and are pursuing climate action to make progress toward its goals. It is time for Michigan to join the effort. Acting pursuant to sections 1 and 8 of article 5 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, I direct the following: As chief executive officer, I commit the State of Michigan to: This directive is effective immediately.

47,Golf - Is It a Sport,Is Golf a Sport?,1s47q1r,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/20/jb-holmes-slow-play-golf-genesis-open,Fifty seconds for a one-foot putt: Is slow play killing golf? | Sport | The Guardian,"JB Holmes frustrated fans and fellow pros with a five-and-a-half hour round on Sunday. Many believe slow play is affecting the growth of the game Anya Alvarez Wed 20 Feb 2019 05.00 EST Last modified on Wed 20 Feb 2019 05.26 EST The video says it all: as JB Holmes paced a 15-foot putt at the Genesis Open, he checked his yardage book thoroughly, presumably looking over notes that he had taken during a practice round. Then he plum bobbed with his putter, stepped away and plum bobbed again, stared down the line of the putt as if he were hunting prey, stood over the ball, then finally hit a shot. Which he missed. It got worse: he then took 50 seconds to hole the one-footer that remained, an age for something even amateurs would consider a tap-in.Despite Holmes breaking the pace of play rule over and over again during the round – the rule book allows players 40 seconds to take their shot – officials failed to give him a penalty. So it was little wonder the round took five-and-a-half hours, 60 minutes more than the suggested pace of play. Holmes is not the only offender on tour. Jordan Spieth and Bryson DeChambeau have faced criticism for their slow play, and early on in Sergio Garcia’s career he was notorious for standing over the ball for what felt like an eternity.I hate to watch slow play because it’s painful reminder that I was a serial offender during my professional playing days. I would step over a shot, only to back off three or four times, and take countless practice swings until finally pulling the trigger. My indecisiveness – driven by anxiety – undoubtedly hurt my playing partners. Not until I received a one-stroke penalty for slow play did I start to speed up. On top of that, other players confronted me and told me how problematic it was for them. The LPGA was right to penalize me, and my playing partners were right to vent their frustration.It appears PGA Tour players are just as frustrated by slow play as their counterparts on the LPGA. Zac Blair wrote on Twitter that Holmes’s play was “ridiculous and … beyond disrespectful to your playing partners and golf in general”. Meanwhile the 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott, who played with Holmes in the final round on Sunday, said sponsors should take action. “The tour is an entertainment business and a big money maker for a lot of people,” Scott said this week. “Until sponsors and TV tell the commissioner you guys play too slow and we’re not putting money up, it’s a waste of time talking about because it’s not going to change.”I guess rules only apply for some players. That was ridiculous how long it took him to play that shot. The rules officials need to change your policy on slow play and be more active on slow players and you won't have these 5 1/2 six hour round. @PGATOURmedia @GolfChannel #finesThe PGA don’t seem too worried: when Miguel Angel Carballo and Brian Campbell were given slow-play penalties in 2017, it was the first such punishment in more than two decades. Penalties and fines should be issued though. Slow golfers simply won’t speed up if they know there are no repercussions. It’s working for Holmes: he won the Genesis Open by one stroke.But outside of slow play being inconsiderate for fellow players, it is also idiotic when golf’s core audience is literally dying. In 2014, Nielsen noted that 63% of the PGA’s television audience was over the age of 55, while only 12% was younger than 35. Meanwhile, only 25% of the NBA’s audience is 55 or older, and 47% is younger than 35. The PGA Tour has the oldest TV viewership of any sports competition in the US at 64 (the youngest are the NBA and MLS at 42 and 40 respectively). Golf needs to attract more young people, and sitting around watching someone indecisively hit a one-foot putt, or figure out the air density as DeChambeau does regularly, is not exactly going to pull in Generation Z.Particularly when golf is up against other sports that don’t allow the luxury of practice shots. Can you imagine if basketball players started mimicking their jump shot in the middle of a game, or if an NFL kicker was allowed as long as he wanted to take a field goal ? The crowds would mercilessly boo, and TV viewers would switch off.Golf doesn’t have much time to figure out a way to draw in a younger audience that is already losing interest in playing and watching the sport.

So many times I have stepped up to a shot, practiced a couple of swings, felt uncomfortable with the thing and stepped away. Maybe the only solution is to allocate a given playing time for a round at every course, then (strictly) penalise player for exceeding this. Slow over rate in cricket?Unfortunately that solution wouldn't work. I detest slow play, but, especially in pressure tournament situations, I can understand the need on occasion to take a little longer over a shot, say a particularly difficult putt, or where the wind is gusting, or playing out of trees, or whatever. A maximum total time would be ideal, but unfortunately if JB Holmes takes nearly six hours to complete his round, then the group playing behind him will as well (unless, like Sunday, he is last on the course). You'd end up having to fine the entire field.No, you wouldn't. Only run the clock when a player is able to take his shot. A player being delayed by the group ahead is no different to a player being delayed by the rest of his own group.Although, come to think of it, I quite like the idea of increased punishments dependent on how many people you're holding up.(Also, curling has a neat answer to the freakishly complicated shot problem: a couple of timeouts per match, when you can stop the clock for ninety seconds and have a think.)Very difficult to manage - not least since the suggested 4 or 4.5 hour time for a round includes a lot of walking and an element of waiting. When do you start the clock? It's too subjective, I feel.Agree on your last point though, and maybe that's the change required. 40 seconds per shot, with a couple of timeouts per round, enforced rigidly.It's the ultimate tightrope: be interesting to watch, otherwise no audience. Or be boring, but giving the objectively best results. If we view sports as a form of art, the latter should be paramount, if it is only entertainment, the former wins. Where are we?If the championship needs a lot of time to claim victory, so be it. If we question why athletes do sports, I'd guess most at the top level don't do it (only) for the money anyway; the competition is far too strong to keep motivation up if you're only eyeing the cash.I disagree, because timewasting is gamesmanship. It doesn't require more skill. It's just putting your opponent off. If long rounds were equal to the highest form of sport as art, then surely everyone would do it. But there are a heck of a lot of great golfers out there who don't play slow.Despite Holmes breaking the pace of play rule over and over again during the round – the rule book allows players 40 seconds to take their shot – officials failed to give him a penalty.This is surely no different. It's either because he cannot play the shot in regulation time or because he wants to discombobulate a bored opponent. Why do the officials refuse to enforce a rule that requires no subjectivity whatsoever?Whats the problem ? Just saw a Guardian article about the joy of endless cricket.You get fined for slow over rates in cricketDid you just read the headline? Because the 'endless cricket' refers to an endless calendar, an excess of matches in many formats.The joy in question, however, was in a time-limited Test match that actually finished a day early.Although I realise that actually reading things before forming an opinion on them is terribly unfashionable.You clearly do not watch a lot of cricket. People are always moaning about teams bowling too slowly and wasting time.Perhaps have an overall time limit for the round, as in chess or curling. If you want to take a while over a particularly tricky shot, fine, but that means you need to rush one later on. Time would not run whilst other players are taking their shots (except in team competitions).In curling, I believe the penalty for running out of time is that you aren't allowed any more stones, and your opponent can keep going to try and catch your score. Obviously that wouldn't work in golf, but maybe it could be adapted - say, a score of two over par recorded for every hole not completed before the time expires.I guess keeping track of the timings of that many golfers at once would be a lot of admin. I guess there maybe over 100 at some times?What you describe happens in most amateur competitions. There is a time stipulated for how long the round should take and an acceptable time gap between your group and the group in front of you. If you are late in either at the end of the round, you are penalized shots.Isn't this the case that the problem is that life is imitating art which is imitating life, in much the same way that soap opera writers create dialogue based on how people speak which is influenced by soap operas (in other words, nobody every really talks like that). Golf operates in a bubble, and if you watch golf from being a child you assume that the way professionals play is THE way to play, so then amateurs emulate those professionals and take an absolute age to play every shot, which then feeds back into the professionals. Have you ever known any other sport that requires the audience to be so patient, quiet, still and reverential of the players? It's pathetic. And I say that as somebody who plays.Re NFL kickers, rugby has exactly that problem with some of its kickers.In Rugby for a penalty they have a minute from the time they indicate they wish to kick a penalty. For a conversion they have ninety seconds. They pretty much keep to the times. If you are watching a minute seems a long time.Any delays are most often caused by referees stopping the game to check that a try has been scored or to admonish an offender for a penalty.Kickers need a bit of time to drop their heart rate for the kick. If you want the ultimate sport for heart rate control you should try biathlon - ski and shoot. It’s an utterly brutal lung-busting race, and then you have to stop and shoot, for which you need to be ice calm. The perfect sport.Why do they get an extra 30 seconds for a conversion? That seems odd...Golf is killing golf. The most boring 'sport' in the known universe. Why don't they have time limits for this stuff like in tennis? The time it takes for someone to putt the ball in is a reflection of his/her competence and experience.the loss of a limb for a exceeding certain proscribed duration. that'd make them think.seriously, though, this is these players' livelihoods; and even a one shot penalty can be a difference of several thousand quid - you'd this would be an incentive almost as much as losing a limb...Slow play is definitely a huge issue but I'm not sure it is killing the game - from what my local club captain has said: 'men who would turn to golf are now turning to cycling'. Anyway...1. Slow play of pro's on the telly stops me watching.2. Slow play on my local courses seems to be partially down to club's overbooking - not just slow players (but this implies that there are people wanting to play, so the game is not being killed).Last October my fourball managed to play 2 holes in 50 minutes, the slowest play I've ever seen and the cause was crap players in a society on an overbooked course - we walked off after waiting an hour to play the 3rd and demanded our money back. The week before we had another slow game (5.5 hrs for 18 holes) on the same course but this time the cause was slow play from members in a comp.I'm sorry, I should have summarised my comment.Slow play isn't killing golf but it is ruining it.You make a really good point about overbooking, although I find that with most society days I take part in there are usually enough experienced people in each fourball to keep everyone up with the group in front. One bugbear I have is getting criticised for slow play by the people behind when I've waited 5 minutes to take my shot. I'm an occasional player and not very good, and I find a lot of golf clubs' arcane rules over etiquette and dress codes quite intimidating - getting grief from other men (it's nearly always men) on the course for slow play that isn't your fault is really offputting. Perhaps clubs should spend more time educating new and occasional players on the importance of considerate speed and less time worrying about whether their shorts are tailored or not.I'm really shit at golf, but still seem to play faster than the 'better' players. I found my already low standards drop if I slow down even more, so need to go quickly to get a rhythm going. I just waste a lot of time taking extra shots and trying to find my ball in rough and bushes.I believe there's a deeper issue which is tougher to address. Whilst I'm completely not advocating slow play, and especially the influence this has on the amateur game, at the same time, every golfer is different.Take snooker as an example. Ronnie O'Sullivan or Jimmy White are famously quick players, whereas Terry Griffiths or Peter Ebdon are the opposite. Golfers will naturally be the same based on their individual temperaments, abilities to make a decision quickly on shot selection etc. Plus, there's so much at stake. A friend of mine who has played off scratch and watched a lot of pro golf tournaments said the big difference between a top amateur and a top pro is the ability to hit a shot under extreme pressure. Most decent golfers can stand on a range and hit perfect shot after perfect shot, but its very different under tournament conditions.I'm not suggesting I have the answer (far from it), and 6 1/2 hours is crazy for a round of golf, especially when you're far less likely than I am to spend a proportion of my round looking for lost balls, but if someone is a naturally slow player, they're unlikely to compromise their ability to compete by (to their mind) rushing their shots.Release tigers. That will speed them up, and be more entertaining.Yeah, I'd watch that.""Is slow play killing golf?""Golf, the game of the people? The sport that billions thrill to every weekend? Golf, that rapid, muscular game played by finely-tuned young athletes with less than ten per cent body fat?Golf, that 90 minute gladitorial challenge of the fastest, fittest, and canniest? That golf? Yes, slow play killed that the instant the rules were codified and the first bloated white men hit the country club bar. Any other questions?What about Tiger's ex girlfriends?Make the prize money tick down as play progresses.Even further spoiling a good walk.If you want to avoid getting bored, just stop watching golf. The most boring 'sport' in the world, ever, ever.I used to enjoy playing Golf however now it’s the other golfers I can’t stand.The idea of the course is interesting, the idea of the clubhouse scares me (based on meeting golfers)Same here. I gave up because I couldn't stand golfers. The game attracts some deeply awful people. And the clubhouses. Christ on a stick.So you're saying that it is golfers who are ruining golf? The evidence does seem to back you up.I was a corse marshal at a big golf tournament a few years ago. I was there the whole week, from practice rounds and the pro-am day through to Sunday, and saw a lot of very famous golfers up close. Two things stood out. One was that most of them are (understandably) locked in to their rounds and make virtually no effort to interact with the fans all around them. The other, of course, is that they play glacially slowly. If you just watched one of these golfers up close and had to guess where they were playing, you'd swear they were on some jam-packed muni course on a weekend. Everything takes forever. The irony is that it didn't used to be this way. The column talks about how golf needs to change to appeal to younger viewers, as though the status quo is what old people want, when it's the older generation who used to just hit the damn ball already.Golf is great to watch when you're on the course, much less so on the box. Unlike Tennis, it is not a game that suits TV. But both sports need to take steps to eradicate slow play. They both also need competitors who are willing to play in front of noisy, boisterous crowds as are the norm in most other popular professional sports. Speed the games up and improve the atmosphere, would create a world of difference in attracting fans , participants and TV coverage.Couldn't disagree more. Sports like Forumla One and golf greatly benefit from TV as you cannot be in all places at once, watching all the shots or overtakes, whilst tennis is just tennis.I think we're coming at this from different angles. My comment is about the experience and the spectacle of golf. It doesn't transmit well on a 2-dimensional TV screen, Tennis does so much more effectively. Golf is far more spectacular when you watch it live.In tennis, you have two players competing against each other in a completely self contained game. Whilst in golf all the players a competing at the same time across an entire course. You cannot be at all places at once, which is why golf benefits from TV. You don't have to stick at hole 4 and watch group after group go by; follow one group and wait whilst they walk 250 yards after a ball. On TV you see all the groupings main actions, without the waiting times that the main article is mentioning.Put an electronic tag round their necks and make it go progressively tighter once they break the time limit. I mean, just how long does it take to put the ball down and hit it up the slope and through the windmill or between the gorilla's legs?I like golf, I always hit a home run. ;-PIt is just the air of great importance which golf-players enjoy - everybody is looking. The same phenomenon can be watched by attentive observers in the slow progress of the Brexit negotiations - the British government is enjoying all the attention, at least Europe wide. I suspect the last time. So Britain enjoy it.Golf has always been boring imo, far too slow paced to hold any interest for me, and now it's getting even slower? Also never understood the exhorbitant cost of golf clubs.They cost what people will pay. People cannot accept that they can improve against themselves, but have to compete against others, and they mean buying the best equipment.As opposed to what ? Replica football kits?There is an idea that the golf clubs are expensive so as to dissuade oiks and poor people from playing.Is there any other kind of golf play?Shot clock - as with other sports. 30 seconds MAX.They have a 40 second clock, but nobody does anything when players take longer.This isn't a rules problem, it's an enforcement problem.With the theme from Countdown going on. Di du, du di, di du du di, BoooooooomI played the Pinhal course in Vilamoura at the weekend. It's a 6,300m championship course, our foursome were all over 50 (with a wide variety of physical ailments that slowed our walking), we had no caddies to carry our bags - and yet we still finished our round inside four hours (and all broke 80).I still wouldn't have watched it on the telly though...... and the back 9?Does everything have to be about satisfying yoof audiences and/or sponsors?Putting it simply, yes! Sponsors are the lifeblood of golf, without them there would be no professional golf! And, if you don’t attract young players/supporters your audience, quite literally, dies out! They are also inextricably linked as Sponsors only sponsor in order to generate brand recognition and association to a popular clean cut sport. Therefore a declining audience makes it increasingly less desirable as a sponsorship vehicle!go down any golf club and count the junior members, there was a waiting list 20 years ago now they struggle to put out a junior team for compsNo. But, as the author says, there's also the issue of respect for your fellow competitors. Play that slowly and you show a lack of respect for those you're playing with, and those that are following you. You can't ""play through"" in a pro comp...These are professional golfers. This is their living and means to provide for themselves and their families. Holing a 15ft or 1ft putt could mean the difference of playing the weekend and taking home some prize money or going home on Friday. It could mean the difference to winning 75k outright or sharing 25k between 5 other players due to finishing 1 shot down the leaderboard.I agree that maybe 50 seconds to hole a gimme is a bit OTT but offer 50k to the average 18hcp Saturday hacker to make that putt on the 18th green and i bet he wouldn't just tap it in on 1 leg without checking the slope and making a few practice strokes.This is their living and means to provide for themselves and their families. Tough. Every golfer is in the same boat and if efforts made to speed up the game apply equally, then what's the problem?Also do you not think the spectators deserve some consideration?And as a single-digit handicapper, I can tell you it makes no difference. You don't see any more in five minutes looking at a putt than you do in five seconds. Frickin' Jack Nicklaus started this stuff back in the 60s, and it has ruined the game. I can turn off the TV - and I do - but I no longer play more than a few times a year because it's not worth spending six hours to play a three-hour round of golf.You do know Test cricket insists on 90 overs a day, and the West Indies have just lost their captain for a game as they failed to achieve it",1,1,Not-about,Not-about,Not-about,0,Not-about,"['Not-about', 'Not-about', 'Not-about']","Is Golf a Sport?

Maybe the only solution is to allocate a given playing time for a round at every course, then (strictly) penalise player for exceeding this. Slow over rate in cricket?Unfortunately that solution wouldn't work. I detest slow play, but, especially in pressure tournament situations, I can understand the need on occasion to take a little longer over a shot, say a particularly difficult putt, or where the wind is gusting, or playing out of trees, or whatever. A maximum total time would be ideal, but unfortunately if JB Holmes takes nearly six hours to complete his round, then the group playing behind him will as well (unless, like Sunday, he is last on the course). You'd end up having to fine the entire field.No, you wouldn't. Only run the clock when a player is able to take his shot. A player being delayed by the group ahead is no different to a player being delayed by the rest of his own group.Although, come to think of it, I quite like the idea of increased punishments dependent on how many people you're holding up.(Also, curling has a neat answer to the freakishly complicated shot problem: a couple of timeouts per match, when you can stop the clock for ninety seconds and have a think.)Very difficult to manage - not least since the suggested 4 or 4.5 hour time for a round includes a lot of walking and an element of waiting. When do you start the clock? It's too subjective, I feel.Agree on your last point though, and maybe that's the change required. 40 seconds per shot, with a couple of timeouts per round, enforced rigidly.It's the ultimate tightrope: be interesting to watch, otherwise no audience. Or be boring, but giving the objectively best results. If we view sports as a form of art, the latter should be paramount, if it is only entertainment, the former wins. Where are we?If the championship needs a lot of time to claim victory, so be it. If we question why athletes do sports, I'd guess most at the top level don't do it (only) for the money anyway; the competition is far too strong to keep motivation up if you're only eyeing the cash.I disagree, because timewasting is gamesmanship. It doesn't require more skill. It's just putting your opponent off. If long rounds were equal to the highest form of sport as art, then surely everyone would do it. But there are a heck of a lot of great golfers out there who don't play slow.Despite Holmes breaking the pace of play rule over and over again during the round – the rule book allows players 40 seconds to take their shot – officials failed to give him a penalty.This is surely no different. It's either because he cannot play the shot in regulation time or because he wants to discombobulate a bored opponent. Why do the officials refuse to enforce a rule that requires no subjectivity whatsoever?Whats the problem ? Just saw a Guardian article about the joy of endless cricket.You get fined for slow over rates in cricketDid you just read the headline? Because the 'endless cricket' refers to an endless calendar, an excess of matches in many formats.The joy in question, however, was in a time-limited Test match that actually finished a day early.Although I realise that actually reading things before forming an opinion on them is terribly unfashionable.You clearly do not watch a lot of cricket. People are always moaning about teams bowling too slowly and wasting time.Perhaps have an overall time limit for the round, as in chess or curling. If you want to take a while over a particularly tricky shot, fine, but that means you need to rush one later on. Time would not run whilst other players are taking their shots (except in team competitions).In curling, I believe the penalty for running out of time is that you aren't allowed any more stones, and your opponent can keep going to try and catch your score. Obviously that wouldn't work in golf, but maybe it could be adapted - say, a score of two over par recorded for every hole not completed before the time expires.I guess keeping track of the timings of that many golfers at once would be a lot of admin. I guess there maybe over 100 at some times?What you describe happens in most amateur competitions. There is a time stipulated for how long the round should take and an acceptable time gap between your group and the group in front of you. If you are late in either at the end of the round, you are penalized shots.Isn't this the case that the problem is that life is imitating art which is imitating life, in much the same way that soap opera writers create dialogue based on how people speak which is influenced by soap operas (in other words, nobody every really talks like that). Golf operates in a bubble, and if you watch golf from being a child you assume that the way professionals play is THE way to play, so then amateurs emulate those professionals and take an absolute age to play every shot, which then feeds back into the professionals. Have you ever known any other sport that requires the audience to be so patient, quiet, still and reverential of the players? It's pathetic. And I say that as somebody who plays.Re NFL kickers, rugby has exactly that problem with some of its kickers.In Rugby for a penalty they have a minute from the time they indicate they wish to kick a penalty. For a conversion they have ninety seconds. They pretty much keep to the times. If you are watching a minute seems a long time.Any delays are most often caused by referees stopping the game to check that a try has been scored or to admonish an offender for a penalty.Kickers need a bit of time to drop their heart rate for the kick. If you want the ultimate sport for heart rate control you should try biathlon - ski and shoot. It’s an utterly brutal lung-busting race, and then you have to stop and shoot, for which you need to be ice calm. The perfect sport.Why do they get an extra 30 seconds for a conversion? That seems odd...Golf is killing golf. The most boring 'sport' in the known universe. Why don't they have time limits for this stuff like in tennis? The time it takes for someone to putt the ball in is a reflection of his/her competence and experience.the loss of a limb for a exceeding certain proscribed duration. that'd make them think.seriously, though, this is these players' livelihoods; and even a one shot penalty can be a difference of several thousand quid - you'd this would be an incentive almost as much as losing a limb...Slow play is definitely a huge issue but I'm not sure it is killing the game - from what my local club captain has said: 'men who would turn to golf are now turning to cycling'. Anyway...1. Slow play of pro's on the telly stops me watching.2. Slow play on my local courses seems to be partially down to club's overbooking - not just slow players (but this implies that there are people wanting to play, so the game is not being killed).Last October my fourball managed to play 2 holes in 50 minutes, the slowest play I've ever seen and the cause was crap players in a society on an overbooked course - we walked off after waiting an hour to play the 3rd and demanded our money back. The week before we had another slow game (5.5 hrs for 18 holes) on the same course but this time the cause was slow play from members in a comp.I'm sorry, I should have summarised my comment.Slow play isn't killing golf but it is ruining it.You make a really good point about overbooking, although I find that with most society days I take part in there are usually enough experienced people in each fourball to keep everyone up with the group in front. One bugbear I have is getting criticised for slow play by the people behind when I've waited 5 minutes to take my shot. I'm an occasional player and not very good, and I find a lot of golf clubs' arcane rules over etiquette and dress codes quite intimidating - getting grief from other men (it's nearly always men) on the course for slow play that isn't your fault is really offputting. Perhaps clubs should spend more time educating new and occasional players on the importance of considerate speed and less time worrying about whether their shorts are tailored or not.I'm really shit at golf, but still seem to play faster than the 'better' players. I found my already low standards drop if I slow down even more, so need to go quickly to get a rhythm going. I just waste a lot of time taking extra shots and trying to find my ball in rough and bushes.I believe there's a deeper issue which is tougher to address. Whilst I'm completely not advocating slow play, and especially the influence this has on the amateur game, at the same time, every golfer is different.Take snooker as an example. Ronnie O'Sullivan or Jimmy White are famously quick players, whereas Terry Griffiths or Peter Ebdon are the opposite. Golfers will naturally be the same based on their individual temperaments, abilities to make a decision quickly on shot selection etc. Plus, there's so much at stake. A friend of mine who has played off scratch and watched a lot of pro golf tournaments said the big difference between a top amateur and a top pro is the ability to hit a shot under extreme pressure. Most decent golfers can stand on a range and hit perfect shot after perfect shot, but its very different under tournament conditions.I'm not suggesting I have the answer (far from it), and 6 1/2 hours is crazy for a round of golf, especially when you're far less likely than I am to spend a proportion of my round looking for lost balls, but if someone is a naturally slow player, they're unlikely to compromise their ability to compete by (to their mind) rushing their shots.Release tigers. That will speed them up, and be more entertaining.Yeah, I'd watch that.""Is slow play killing golf?""Golf, the game of the people? The sport that billions thrill to every weekend? Golf, that rapid, muscular game played by finely-tuned young athletes with less than ten per cent body fat?Golf, that 90 minute gladitorial challenge of the fastest, fittest, and canniest? That golf? Yes, slow play killed that the instant the rules were codified and the first bloated white men hit the country club bar. Any other questions?What about Tiger's ex girlfriends?Make the prize money tick down as play progresses.Even further spoiling a good walk.If you want to avoid getting bored, just stop watching golf. The most boring 'sport' in the world, ever, ever.I used to enjoy playing Golf however now it’s the other golfers I can’t stand.The idea of the course is interesting, the idea of the clubhouse scares me (based on meeting golfers)Same here. I gave up because I couldn't stand golfers. The game attracts some deeply awful people. And the clubhouses. Christ on a stick.So you're saying that it is golfers who are ruining golf? The evidence does seem to back you up.I was a corse marshal at a big golf tournament a few years ago. I was there the whole week, from practice rounds and the pro-am day through to Sunday, and saw a lot of very famous golfers up close. Two things stood out. One was that most of them are (understandably) locked in to their rounds and make virtually no effort to interact with the fans all around them. The other, of course, is that they play glacially slowly. If you just watched one of these golfers up close and had to guess where they were playing, you'd swear they were on some jam-packed muni course on a weekend. Everything takes forever. The irony is that it didn't used to be this way. The column talks about how golf needs to change to appeal to younger viewers, as though the status quo is what old people want, when it's the older generation who used to just hit the damn ball already.Golf is great to watch when you're on the course, much less so on the box. Unlike Tennis, it is not a game that suits TV. But both sports need to take steps to eradicate slow play. They both also need competitors who are willing to play in front of noisy, boisterous crowds as are the norm in most other popular professional sports. Speed the games up and improve the atmosphere, would create a world of difference in attracting fans , participants and TV coverage.Couldn't disagree more. Sports like Forumla One and golf greatly benefit from TV as you cannot be in all places at once, watching all the shots or overtakes, whilst tennis is just tennis.I think we're coming at this from different angles. My comment is about the experience and the spectacle of golf. It doesn't transmit well on a 2-dimensional TV screen, Tennis does so much more effectively. Golf is far more spectacular when you watch it live.In tennis, you have two players competing against each other in a completely self contained game. Whilst in golf all the players a competing at the same time across an entire course. You cannot be at all places at once, which is why golf benefits from TV. You don't have to stick at hole 4 and watch group after group go by; follow one group and wait whilst they walk 250 yards after a ball. On TV you see all the groupings main actions, without the waiting times that the main article is mentioning.Put an electronic tag round their necks and make it go progressively tighter once they break the time limit. I mean, just how long does it take to put the ball down and hit it up the slope and through the windmill or between the gorilla's legs?I like golf, I always hit a home run. ;-PIt is just the air of great importance which golf-players enjoy - everybody is looking. The same phenomenon can be watched by attentive observers in the slow progress of the Brexit negotiations - the British government is enjoying all the attention, at least Europe wide. I suspect the last time. So Britain enjoy it.Golf has always been boring imo, far too slow paced to hold any interest for me, and now it's getting even slower? Also never understood the exhorbitant cost of golf clubs.They cost what people will pay. People cannot accept that they can improve against themselves, but have to compete against others, and they mean buying the best equipment.As opposed to what ? Replica football kits?There is an idea that the golf clubs are expensive so as to dissuade oiks and poor people from playing.Is there any other kind of golf play?Shot clock - as with other sports. 30 seconds MAX.They have a 40 second clock, but nobody does anything when players take longer.This isn't a rules problem, it's an enforcement problem.With the theme from Countdown going on. Di du, du di, di du du di, BoooooooomI played the Pinhal course in Vilamoura at the weekend. It's a 6,300m championship course, our foursome were all over 50 (with a wide variety of physical ailments that slowed our walking), we had no caddies to carry our bags - and yet we still finished our round inside four hours (and all broke 80).I still wouldn't have watched it on the telly though...... and the back 9?Does everything have to be about satisfying yoof audiences and/or sponsors?Putting it simply, yes! Sponsors are the lifeblood of golf, without them there would be no professional golf! And, if you don’t attract young players/supporters your audience, quite literally, dies out! They are also inextricably linked as Sponsors only sponsor in order to generate brand recognition and association to a popular clean cut sport. Therefore a declining audience makes it increasingly less desirable as a sponsorship vehicle!go down any golf club and count the junior members, there was a waiting list 20 years ago now they struggle to put out a junior team for compsNo. But, as the author says, there's also the issue of respect for your fellow competitors. Play that slowly and you show a lack of respect for those you're playing with, and those that are following you. You can't ""play through"" in a pro comp...These are professional golfers. This is their living and means to provide for themselves and their families. Holing a 15ft or 1ft putt could mean the difference of playing the weekend and taking home some prize money or going home on Friday. It could mean the difference to winning 75k outright or sharing 25k between 5 other players due to finishing 1 shot down the leaderboard.I agree that maybe 50 seconds to hole a gimme is a bit OTT but offer 50k to the average 18hcp Saturday hacker to make that putt on the 18th green and i bet he wouldn't just tap it in on 1 leg without checking the slope and making a few practice strokes.This is their living and means to provide for themselves and their families. Tough. Every golfer is in the same boat and if efforts made to speed up the game apply equally, then what's the problem?Also do you not think the spectators deserve some consideration?And as a single-digit handicapper, I can tell you it makes no difference. You don't see any more in five minutes looking at a putt than you do in five seconds. Frickin' Jack Nicklaus started this stuff back in the 60s, and it has ruined the game. I can turn off the TV - and I do - but I no longer play more than a few times a year because it's not worth spending six hours to play a three-hour round of golf.You do know Test cricket insists on 90 overs a day, and the West Indies have just lost their captain for a game as they failed to achieve it",4283,4263

Few would argue, though, that helping the poor is a not a responsibility within a healthy society.The question here is with whom does that responsibility rest? Government or the compassionate neighbor? Our Founding Fathers had an opinion. During the Haitian revolution, islanders fled to New England escaping French persecution. The influx of refugees proved difficult and a petition to the federal government was made for assistance. In 1794, James Madison stood on the House floor and objected, ""I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents … Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.”The fact that benevolence from the public treasury is not a power granted by the Constitution was reaffirmed by Thomas Jefferson in 1817. He penned, “Our tenet ever was that Congress had not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but were restrained to those specifically enumerated so it could not have been meant they should raise money for purposes which the enumeration did not place under their action.”In like, Benjamin Franklin simply said “I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.”That was their opinion, and if it’s yours, you’re already favoring private funding over public.But even if we set aside the hope of our Founding Fathers to spare this great republic from a metastatic federal government, we should ask ourselves, “Can we afford it?”We can’t afford public funding.Not including Medicare and Social Security, the federal government projects to spend $918 billion on caring for the poor this year. That number is important. Not only does it represent a fourth of our entire federal budget, but it’s very close to the annual debt escalation over the last decade.Some may think this a lofty argument for private funding, but for the hardworking taxpayer, it’s very relevant. By that person, the question, “Whose money is it?” may very well be answered, “It’s mine!” Is he right? Consider Micah 4:4 and the description under Christ’s future reign: “… (E)ach man will sit under his own grapevine and under his own fig tree with no one to frighten him.” Whose fig tree? His own. These and scores of other verses in the Bible indicate that private property is a natural right.In other words, if a man plows a field, the harvest is his.Whether it goes to Planned Parenthood or comes to my Gospel Rescue Mission, it’s not the government’s to give. It’s someone else’s personal property and that someone else should have the right to support what he or she desires.If you agree that it’s not the government’s money, then we must ask, “Can it be the government’s responsibility?”It’s our responsibilitySubsidiarity is about neighbor helping neighbor before the government helps your neighbor.Some might say that's impossible. Edward Divine, a leader in the formation of social work and General Secretary of the New York Charitable Organization Society in 1896 challenged, “If there were no resources in times of exceptional distress except the provision which people would voluntarily make on their own account and the informal neighborly help which people would give to one another … most of the misfortunes would still be provided for.”I believe it. I was in Joplin on May 22, 2011, when it suffered a catastrophic disaster. A mile-wide F5 tornado rendered more than 7,000 people homeless in less than an hour. I watched what government funding could never have done. The relief provided through personal sacrifice, private contributions and countless kind and neighborly acts was immeasurable and proof that in times of great need, a good neighbor can do much more than a big government.Lastly, we can bet that with government funding comes government oversight. These strings are long tying our missions to bureaucrats in Washington. And though they may not seem too stringent, it’s only a matter of time before the administration changes along with the rules.To embrace liberty is to embrace more than just freedom from government tyranny but freedom from government dependency. After all, the latter is certain to lead to the former.James Whitford is the co-founder and executive director of Watered Gardens Gospel Rescue Mission, Joplin.

He penned, “Our tenet ever was that Congress had not unlimited powers to provide for the general welfare, but were restrained to those specifically enumerated so it could not have been meant they should raise money for purposes which the enumeration did not place under their action.”In like, Benjamin Franklin simply said “I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.”That was their opinion, and if it’s yours, you’re already favoring private funding over public.But even if we set aside the hope of our Founding Fathers to spare this great republic from a metastatic federal government, we should ask ourselves, “Can we afford it?”We can’t afford public funding.Not including Medicare and Social Security, the federal government projects to spend $918 billion on caring for the poor this year. That number is important. Not only does it represent a fourth of our entire federal budget, but it’s very close to the annual debt escalation over the last decade.Some may think this a lofty argument for private funding, but for the hardworking taxpayer, it’s very relevant. By that person, the question, “Whose money is it?” may very well be answered, “It’s mine!” Is he right? Consider Micah 4:4 and the description under Christ’s future reign: “… (E)ach man will sit under his own grapevine and under his own fig tree with no one to frighten him.” Whose fig tree? His own. These and scores of other verses in the Bible indicate that private property is a natural right.In other words, if a man plows a field, the harvest is his.Whether it goes to Planned Parenthood or comes to my Gospel Rescue Mission, it’s not the government’s to give. It’s someone else’s personal property and that someone else should have the right to support what he or she desires.If you agree that it’s not the government’s money, then we must ask, “Can it be the government’s responsibility?”It’s our responsibilitySubsidiarity is about neighbor helping neighbor before the government helps your neighbor.Some might say that's impossible. Edward Divine, a leader in the formation of social work and General Secretary of the New York Charitable Organization Society in 1896 challenged, “If there were no resources in times of exceptional distress except the provision which people would voluntarily make on their own account and the informal neighborly help which people would give to one another … most of the misfortunes would still be provided for.”I believe it. I was in Joplin on May 22, 2011, when it suffered a catastrophic disaster. A mile-wide F5 tornado rendered more than 7,000 people homeless in less than an hour. I watched what government funding could never have done. The relief provided through personal sacrifice, private contributions and countless kind and neighborly acts was immeasurable and proof that in times of great need, a good neighbor can do much more than a big government.Lastly, we can bet that with government funding comes government oversight. These strings are long tying our missions to bureaucrats in Washington. And though they may not seem too stringent, it’s only a matter of time before the administration changes along with the rules.To embrace liberty is to embrace more than just freedom from government tyranny but freedom from government dependency. After all, the latter is certain to lead to the former.James Whitford is the co-founder and executive director of Watered Gardens Gospel Rescue Mission, Joplin. This is so incredibly good and thought out!...but so much of the country would call him a radical nut .....because that's how you control people and gain power... Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.First Amendment: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.",885,866

Abigail Spanberger quizzed on immigration in first town hall - The Washington Post,"Desktop notifications are on   | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications? GOOCHLAND, Va. — Freshman Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) went to the conservative heart of her district Tuesday night for her first town hall, where she broke with many of her constituents on immigration but thanked them for avoiding the vitriol that often dominates today’s hyperpartisan politics. The room at a recreation center in rural Goochland County 30 miles outside of Richmond was full of tea-party-style Republicans, some of whom said they did not vote for Spanberger but still came to hear her out.Three out of 10 questions focused on immigration, less than a week after Congress approved a border security deal to avoid a second partial government shutdown and President Trump declared a national emergency to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Stan Corn of Goochland, the county seat, wanted to know why Spanberger didn’t support the $5.7 billion in funding that Trump wanted for the wall.Spanberger replied that she had voted for a bill that included funding for border infrastructure, technology at ports of entry and more security personnel at the border.Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, narrowly defeated the Republican incumbent, Dave Brat, in November, turning the district blue for the first time in nearly half a century. Her campaign capitalized on Democrats’ discontent with Trump without alienating moderate Republicans.While Brat angered constituents and activists by refusing to hold town halls and complaining that women “were in my grill,” Spanberger was even-tempered Tuesday evening — and so was her audience.“Given the run-up to where we are now, how lucky do you feel that you can have a nice, peaceful, civil town hall with people who disagree with you?” asked Jeff Atkinson, a Brat supporter from western Henrico County who said Democratic activists have acted out at similar events.Spanberger answered, “Very,” and added, “I know there’s quite a few people in the room who didn’t vote for me, and I thank you very sincerely for being here.”In an interview, Atkinson said he would “reserve judgment” on Spanberger’s performance in Congress, but he was not satisfied with her answers on immigration questions.Goochland is a solidly Republican county, population about 22,000, where Trump won 60 percent of the vote. Spanberger lost in this part of her district but captured enough support in nearby Chesterfield County and Henrico, her home county, to win the 7th District with just over 50 percent of the vote.Spanberger met with Trump during the 35-day partial shutdown as a member of the centrist, bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. She told her audience Tuesday night that the president assured her that he did not support “a concrete barrier wall ocean to ocean,” which she also opposes.Asked by Delbert Horn of Goochland about sanctuary cities, Spanberger said she worried about local jurisdictions enforcing federal immigration law without the necessary training and certification.“I don’t support sanctuary cities,” she said. “I don’t support safe havens for criminals. But I do also support ensuring that jurisdiction is upheld.”At the end of the town hall, a third resident asked Spanberger if the federal government should withhold funding from sanctuary cities. About half the audience applauded for the question, which she did not answer directly.In a phone interview after the town hall, Spanberger said she would not “talk in simplistic platitudes” about the complicated issue of immigration.“Talking about the quote-unquote sanctuary cities, or not — it’s a campaign slogan a lot of people get caught up in,” she said. “And I think it degrades the value of the conversation if we’re not actually talking about what the real concern is.”Another question focused on late-term abortion, an issue that was in the news last month after a Democratic state lawmaker and Gov. Ralph Northam (D) bungled questions about legislation that would have made it easier for women whose health was at risk to terminate a third-trimester pregnancy.Days after that controversy, the Democratic establishment called for Northam’s resignation after revelations that his medical school yearbook page included a racist photo and his subsequent acknowledgment that he had worn blackface.“Virginia has received pretty bad publicity lately,” Charlotte Whitmire of Goochland said, before asking Spanberger whether she supported the late-term abortion bill sponsored by Del. Kathy Tran (D-Fairfax).Spanberger, who has three children, said that when a woman is told her pregnancy could threaten her life, lawmakers shouldn’t play a role in those “heartbreaking and, to me, truly incomprehensible scenarios and conversations.”“I don’t see the need, frankly for the bill that Kathy Tran was pushing,” she said. “There are already legal parameters that [a woman] facing those sorts of circumstances can have hard conversations with her physician about the right steps forward.”Jonathan Lyle, who sits on the Goochland Soil and Water Conservation District, asked about the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal by fellow freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) that aims to cut greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years and guarantee jobs for all.Spanberger called the plan a “bold compilation of ideas meant to address global climate change” but said it includes unrelated policy objectives and doesn’t prescribe specific solutions for problems it outlines.“Overall, I am not a supporter of the Green New Deal,” she said.Spanberger, one of eight female members spoofed earlier this month on “Saturday Night Live,” has emerged as one of the more- high-profile members of the freshman class in Congress.One of 15 Democrats who did not vote for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to become House speaker, she nevertheless landed seats she wanted on the Foreign Affairs and Agriculture committees. She chairs the Agriculture subcommittee on conservation and forestry.Read more:As children, families cross the border, agents offer snacks and medical checksMajority of Virginians back late abortions if woman’s life at riskThe women got up in Brat’s ‘grill’, and then someLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)Like PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news localvirginia-politicsLocal Headlines newsletterImportant local stories in D.C., Va. and Md., around 8 a.m. on weekdays.Thank You!You are now subscribed to Local Headlines Please enter a valid email address You might also like...

32,Felon Voting,"Should Felons Who Have Completed Their Sentence (Incarceration, Probation, and Parole) Be Allowed to Vote?",2s32q10r,https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/jussie-smollett-felony-false-report-1203142874/,Jussie Smollett Faces Prison if He Lied About Attack – Variety,"Jussie Smollett is facing prison time and the implosion of his career if it turns out he lied about being the target of a hate crime, legal and public relations experts say.“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack. Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. Update: NBC News reported Tuesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanor counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the L.A. City Attorney’s office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.” Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.” What a SCUM bag!!! Karma will get him what kind of MONSTER would lie about something like this?? What a psychopath! I would never watch that show if he came back onKaren, please see a shrink ASAP, you need help. Apparently, you’re lacking in CHOLINE to think straight, Good God woman, or whatever you are, Smollett did way more evil than Lochte ever did, Smollett is a high class manipulator con man sociopath. Lochte was a moronic idiot athlete who wanted attention. Smollett wanted to start a WAR between races, PRETEND he was a GAY VICTIM by manufacturing homophobic slurs SLAPPING in the face others who are REAL VICTIMS of racial and homophobic slurs, Lochte was just an idiot that didn’t bring up RACE OR BEING GAY or any of the talking point emotionallly charged war time media obsessive topics, nope…totally different honey, wtfup. Smollett did a psychological operation from a sociopathic standpoing and THANK GOD we still live in a country with SOUND MINDS and hearts and a GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT that can expose and take on this NONSENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!Jussie wanted to create fodder for the DEMS to use in their stump speeches against Trump in the 2020 election! Dems would have had him ruminate about his ‘incident’ at the DNC against Trump. Jussie implicated his reason for the stunt on GMA with Robin Roberts. He made it clear he was out to get Number 45! He used the EMPIRE pay reason as a foil! Wake up folks! It’s a political tactic plain and simple! He wanted his ‘attack’ to come to the forefront at election time! And indeed it will…but now in support of Trump! Foolish little angry, sociopathic Jussie. He’s now unfortunately become the poster child to re-elect Trump.Don’t fire him from the show, please. Give him the mental health assistance that he needs. You can suspend him for a season but please don’t fire him. We all make mistakes. Let us take a look at Lochte. He is a celebrity that made false statements about being mugged. He was told that boys will be boys. He gets the opportunity to perform in the 2020 Olympics. Why not give Smollet the same slap on the wrist and have him sit out a season? Please let us teach our kids that justice is not color blind.ENOUGH OF JARGON AND SUPPOSITIONS – SHOW ME SOME BEEF! Results of DNA tests. Are they positive? Jussie said, 1) he was in a scuffle with two big guys which left him bruised; 2) the guys put a noose around his neck; and 3) the guys doused him with bleach. Has news media questioned whether or not fiber analysis of skin and clothing items were performed being that the two guys and Jussie at some point during this situation held the noose. Bleach residue should have been on some articles of clothing of the two accused guys’ apartment should have been found. Media is reporting a lot of stuff but what about reporting what the hospital people have to say. Did Jussie actually purchase a Subway sandwich – did he eat it before leaving the store – was the storekeeper questioned? Regarding Jessie’s phone he was fortunate to keep a hold on it during the scuffle he had with the two big guys but l wouldn’t have given over my phone either — I know a great many who feel the same. There is sooooo much malarkey being slug right now. However this pans out Jussie certainly is in the mist of some mess. At the onset of Jussie’s report of the mugging, I felt that things with his tale didn’t make sense. Either way it goes: 1) is Jussie being truthful or 2) is Jussie going to speak upon his mental health problems he may have been suffering with for a long time in his life. Money is the root of all evil.Karma is a Hillary.Money isn’t the root of all evil, you twit. The verse is “The LOVE of money is the root of all evil”, as in excessive greed and avarice. -_-”Headline with “if”. lmao. Grow up Variety. The problem is you too.They have too say “if” because it hasn’t been proven 100% he lied. Why would they open themselves up to a lawsuit“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this?” Stop with the BS already! What is that supposed to mean? A court or jury won’t prosecute Smollett because they don’t want to “ruin a guy’s life..” ? Think about how insane this statement is. What about the fact Smollett has ruined MILLIONS of people’s lives with his deliberate and malicious hoax? You will see the ruins of Smollett in the coming months and years when more and more people ignore real victims and racism because they’ve been pushed too far, for too long with too little justice seen in cases that involve corrupt, LYING liberals full of hate and malice. Smollett wore a T shirt for pete’s sake that said F TRUMP ,and then orchestrated a hoax that BLAMED Trump supporters. Smollett is very smart. He’s not mentally ill, he is a manipulator and parasite.If there is such a thing as social justice, is there such a thing as a social crime? He has slandered the half of the country that supports the President. He has fomented hate between the races. He has sown animosity toward police. This is an attack on the unity of all Americans-tearing at the social fabric that unites us all. Lefties? A social crime, yes? Lefties, how to punish a social crime?This shows just how how ignorant this dumbass is. Then here comes the Empire cast kissing his butt. Oh poor baby. He is a racist, as well as his bros and the idiots that fell for this vicious lie.I personally believe he fabricated the whole thing up to further his agenda Greed can make people do some very bad things!Fire his dumb ass and have him jailed which is what anyone else would have done to them.Perfect example of racism being made worse than it is. The story is nonsensical and assumes not only was he the victim of a hate crime but that people who wouldn’t have a clue about him as an actor from a show they wouldn’t watch, certainly seemed to know who he was, all his background and his whereabouts oh and didn’t attack anyone else but were wandering with bleach and a vendetta against black people? Come ON….. stop. We CAN get past racism, but not if black people keep getting accolades for victimhood, that’s why he did it. He was a hero victim and now he’s a lying non victim but liberal media will want to sweep under the rug. MESSAGE TO ALL AMERICANS: STOP JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS SO QUICKLY BEFORE THE EVIDENCE IS EXAMINED. VICTIMHOOD IS WEAK, BLACK PEOPLE CAN ALSO BE VICTORS EVEN WHEN VICTIMIZED SO MAYBE PUSH THAT NARRATIVE. It’s like the media treats black people as these inferior beings and then claims to be “on their side”. I tend to think much more of black people in general, they are phenomenal athletes, lower suicide rate and really not as bad off as the media wants us to “see”. Poverty is the issue, not race. Poor whites have an evenly rough time as poor blacks, maybe it’s time we address poverty properly and reform welfare so that people CAN get off of it. (Most people want to, but as a former welfare recipient who can do simple math, the exponential rate of increased rents, bills, and hacking away medical and food stamps encourage folks to stay on it, in fact most people will have more money not working after literally EVERYTHING is raised or slashed making it very freaking tough to jump ship, took me 3 jobs and 80 hours a week for a year just to save for a security deposit.)Variety, like others tried to protect this racist liar. Call for his immediate firing. Fox should terminate him immediately – this was premeditated fraud.They’re gonna love this little flower in prison. Jussie’s gonna be pleasing a lotta folk.Jussy is a scumbag Sincerely proud MAGA supporterWell since he loves cock more than pussy I just hope you’re happy boy in prison hahahaRight wingers are essentially accusing the FBI, and the US Justice Department led by a Republican, and police departments of naively believing thousands of hate crimes occurred, even though cases were investigated, or recorded in department statistics every year.Donald Trump can first apologize for believing the Chicago Police Dept’s statements that Smollett was a credible victim of a hate crime…Actually, the only apology must come from Smollett, and offered to all Americans.Did Reverend Al jump on this one as quick as Tawnay Brayley? May spelled wrong. Money 2 be made Al. Lied never played but ruined lives. Hate crimes happen but clown shoes Jussie lied. Make him repay the man hours wasted and make him a pariah. It won’t happen right Reverend Al? Sorry gotta go get paid off people’s misery. Jussie is shit and I live certain shows on Fox but won’t watch till this idiot is firedJUSSIE WAS FILLED WITH HATE, AND IT LED TO HIS DOWNFALL. GOOD.He has been too lucky, Smollet. Now he betrays his partners in crime to save his stretched ass, and it is despicable. He has taken his lucky break and broken it in two, and it is time to pay the consequences.Hey! Do I hear apologies from anyone? Jussie Smollett? The liberal lawmakers? The liberal so-called celebrities? The liberal candidates for president? Hmmm. No. The silence is deafening.If he lied about the attack? Is that a friggen JOKE?Jussie is obviously a very disturbed, mentally ill young man!! But I believe he did this out of greed, not mental illness!! He wanted to become more famous and make a lot of money. That is just being a very selfish person!! You can even see that he is a selfish, self absorbed, narcissist by looking at his face and the facial expressions he makes!! His face alone says a lot about him, not to mention his LIES!!What a very, very sickening person he is.

If so, it is one the most stupid things I’ve heard of. So many strive to reach fame and fortune and this guy had a bit of that and, so it seems, has thrown all of that away.I no more condone draconian action against Jussie than I did the body slamming of Roseanne or Megyn because of politically volatile statements.

Jussie Smollett Faces Prison if He Lied About Attack – Variety Jussie Smollett is facing prison time and the implosion of his career if it turns out he lied about being the target of a hate crime, legal and public relations experts say.“The best thing that Jussie can do is pray and pray a lot,” said Ronn Torossian, founder of 5W Public Relations. “If he made it up, he has big problems in both the court of law and the court of public opinion.”The “Empire” star claimed he was beaten up on Jan. 29 by two men who used racial and homophobic slurs. Smollett’s co-stars and colleagues on “Empire,” celebrities such as Ellen Page and Zendaya, and public figures such as Sen. Kamala Harris rallied behind the actor, releasing statements of support. However, Smollett’s account is now being challenged, with police investigating whether or not he paid two acquaintances, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, to stage the attack. Chicago police confirmed on Tuesday that they received a tip from someone claiming to have seen the three men together in an elevator of Smollett’s apartment building on the evening of the attack. However, later in the day, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted that the tip was unfounded.If Smollett falsified a police report, the charge is a Class 4 felony in Illinois, and carries a potential sentence of one to three years in prison. Smollett could also be ordered to pay restitution to compensate for the cost of the Chicago Police Department investigation.“It’s a very, very, very serious situation,” said Phil Turner, a former federal prosecutor who now works in criminal defense in Chicago. “He’s got some very significant exposure.”Smollett told police that two men attacked him at 2 a.m., poured bleach on him, and put a noose around his neck. He also claimed they told him that it was “MAGA country,” a reference to Donald Trump’s campaign slogan. Chicago investigators are now seeking to speak with Smollett.Federal investigators are also probing a threatening letter that was sent to the “Empire” set. The letter included homophobic language and contained a white powder, which was later determined to be a crushed painkiller tablet. Should that letter turn out to be fake, federal prosecutors could also pursue a mail fraud charge, legal experts say.Andrew Weisberg, a former prosecutor in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office, said Smollett could get probation, assuming that he has a clean record. Update: NBC News reported Tuesday, and Variety confirmed, that Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 to three misdemeanor counts stemming from a DUI incident in Los Angeles, including one count of giving false information to the police. According to the criminal complaint filed by the L.A. City Attorney’s office, Smollett gave a false name, pretending to be his brother Jake. He was sentenced to three years of probation.Weisberg also said prosecutors may face pressure not to be lenient.“It’s a very high-profile case,” he said. “Prosecutors tend to be tougher because everybody’s watching. … I think they may come down hard, in terms of not reducing it to a misdemeanor.” Steve Greenberg, a Chicago defense attorney, said prosecutors could also file a charge of obstruction of justice. He said it was likely, though, that Smollett would be allowed to plead to a misdemeanor, and not serve jail time.“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this,” Greenberg said. “People make false reports all the time to the police. They get in a DUI, they call police and say, ‘My car was stolen.’ Ninety percent of the time, even if they’re charged with a felony, those people end up pleading to a misdemeanor.”Smollett has retained two criminal defense attorneys, Victor Henderson and Todd Pugh. They have denied that Smollett staged the attack, and said he will continue to cooperate.“His lawyers may be having a psychiatrist examine the guy so they could prepare some kind of psychiatric defense,” Turner said.Smollett, like celebrity fabulists such as Lance Armstrong and Ryan Lochte, may see endorsement opportunities and roles dry up if he is found to have been untruthful. Public relations experts say he will need to demonstrate that he’s learned a lesson.“If he made this up, he broke the trust of a lot of his fans,” said Ray Drasnin, founder of Purple Penguin PR. “Say you lied and you’re sorry for that lie. Apologize to the people who have supported you, promise to make it up, and find a cause that’s near and dear to your heart and devote yourself to it.”Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, said people shouldn’t rush to judgment regarding Smollet and cautioned that there are still, in the words of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, “too many unknown unknowns.” Yet if Smollett did fabricate the attack, Levick says he needs to be more proactive.“He needs to get ahead of this as much as he can,” he said. “He needs to go see the police. He needs to apologize. He needs to make the announcement about what happened instead of letting the facts leak out. If he lied, there’s no excuse, but there may be some explanation.” What a SCUM bag!!! Karma will get him what kind of MONSTER would lie about something like this?? What a psychopath! I would never watch that show if he came back onKaren, please see a shrink ASAP, you need help. Apparently, you’re lacking in CHOLINE to think straight, Good God woman, or whatever you are, Smollett did way more evil than Lochte ever did, Smollett is a high class manipulator con man sociopath. Lochte was a moronic idiot athlete who wanted attention. Smollett wanted to start a WAR between races, PRETEND he was a GAY VICTIM by manufacturing homophobic slurs SLAPPING in the face others who are REAL VICTIMS of racial and homophobic slurs, Lochte was just an idiot that didn’t bring up RACE OR BEING GAY or any of the talking point emotionallly charged war time media obsessive topics, nope…totally different honey, wtfup. Smollett did a psychological operation from a sociopathic standpoing and THANK GOD we still live in a country with SOUND MINDS and hearts and a GREAT LAW ENFORCEMENT that can expose and take on this NONSENSE!!!!!!!!!!!!Jussie wanted to create fodder for the DEMS to use in their stump speeches against Trump in the 2020 election! Dems would have had him ruminate about his ‘incident’ at the DNC against Trump. Jussie implicated his reason for the stunt on GMA with Robin Roberts. He made it clear he was out to get Number 45! He used the EMPIRE pay reason as a foil! Wake up folks! It’s a political tactic plain and simple! He wanted his ‘attack’ to come to the forefront at election time! And indeed it will…but now in support of Trump! Foolish little angry, sociopathic Jussie. He’s now unfortunately become the poster child to re-elect Trump.Don’t fire him from the show, please. Give him the mental health assistance that he needs. You can suspend him for a season but please don’t fire him. We all make mistakes. Let us take a look at Lochte. He is a celebrity that made false statements about being mugged. He was told that boys will be boys. He gets the opportunity to perform in the 2020 Olympics. Why not give Smollet the same slap on the wrist and have him sit out a season? Please let us teach our kids that justice is not color blind.ENOUGH OF JARGON AND SUPPOSITIONS – SHOW ME SOME BEEF! Results of DNA tests. Are they positive? Jussie said, 1) he was in a scuffle with two big guys which left him bruised; 2) the guys put a noose around his neck; and 3) the guys doused him with bleach. Has news media questioned whether or not fiber analysis of skin and clothing items were performed being that the two guys and Jussie at some point during this situation held the noose. Bleach residue should have been on some articles of clothing of the two accused guys’ apartment should have been found. Media is reporting a lot of stuff but what about reporting what the hospital people have to say. Did Jussie actually purchase a Subway sandwich – did he eat it before leaving the store – was the storekeeper questioned? Regarding Jessie’s phone he was fortunate to keep a hold on it during the scuffle he had with the two big guys but l wouldn’t have given over my phone either — I know a great many who feel the same. There is sooooo much malarkey being slug right now. However this pans out Jussie certainly is in the mist of some mess. At the onset of Jussie’s report of the mugging, I felt that things with his tale didn’t make sense. Either way it goes: 1) is Jussie being truthful or 2) is Jussie going to speak upon his mental health problems he may have been suffering with for a long time in his life. Money is the root of all evil.Karma is a Hillary.Money isn’t the root of all evil, you twit. The verse is “The LOVE of money is the root of all evil”, as in excessive greed and avarice. -_-”Headline with “if”. lmao. Grow up Variety. The problem is you too.They have too say “if” because it hasn’t been proven 100% he lied. Why would they open themselves up to a lawsuit“They’re not going to ruin a guy’s life over this?” Stop with the BS already! What is that supposed to mean? A court or jury won’t prosecute Smollett because they don’t want to “ruin a guy’s life..” ? Think about how insane this statement is. What about the fact Smollett has ruined MILLIONS of people’s lives with his deliberate and malicious hoax? You will see the ruins of Smollett in the coming months and years when more and more people ignore real victims and racism because they’ve been pushed too far, for too long with too little justice seen in cases that involve corrupt, LYING liberals full of hate and malice. Smollett wore a T shirt for pete’s sake that said F TRUMP ,and then orchestrated a hoax that BLAMED Trump supporters. Smollett is very smart. He’s not mentally ill, he is a manipulator and parasite.If there is such a thing as social justice, is there such a thing as a social crime? He has slandered the half of the country that supports the President. He has fomented hate between the races. He has sown animosity toward police. This is an attack on the unity of all Americans-tearing at the social fabric that unites us all. Lefties? A social crime, yes? Lefties, how to punish a social crime?This shows just how how ignorant this dumbass is. Then here comes the Empire cast kissing his butt. Oh poor baby. He is a racist, as well as his bros and the idiots that fell for this vicious lie.I personally believe he fabricated the whole thing up to further his agenda Greed can make people do some very bad things!Fire his dumb ass and have him jailed which is what anyone else would have done to them.Perfect example of racism being made worse than it is. The story is nonsensical and assumes not only was he the victim of a hate crime but that people who wouldn’t have a clue about him as an actor from a show they wouldn’t watch, certainly seemed to know who he was, all his background and his whereabouts oh and didn’t attack anyone else but were wandering with bleach and a vendetta against black people? Come ON….. stop. We CAN get past racism, but not if black people keep getting accolades for victimhood, that’s why he did it. He was a hero victim and now he’s a lying non victim but liberal media will want to sweep under the rug. MESSAGE TO ALL AMERICANS: STOP JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS SO QUICKLY BEFORE THE EVIDENCE IS EXAMINED. VICTIMHOOD IS WEAK, BLACK PEOPLE CAN ALSO BE VICTORS EVEN WHEN VICTIMIZED SO MAYBE PUSH THAT NARRATIVE. It’s like the media treats black people as these inferior beings and then claims to be “on their side”. I tend to think much more of black people in general, they are phenomenal athletes, lower suicide rate and really not as bad off as the media wants us to “see”. Poverty is the issue, not race. Poor whites have an evenly rough time as poor blacks, maybe it’s time we address poverty properly and reform welfare so that people CAN get off of it. (Most people want to, but as a former welfare recipient who can do simple math, the exponential rate of increased rents, bills, and hacking away medical and food stamps encourage folks to stay on it, in fact most people will have more money not working after literally EVERYTHING is raised or slashed making it very freaking tough to jump ship, took me 3 jobs and 80 hours a week for a year just to save for a security deposit.)Variety, like others tried to protect this racist liar. Call for his immediate firing. Fox should terminate him immediately – this was premeditated fraud.They’re gonna love this little flower in prison. Jussie’s gonna be pleasing a lotta folk.Jussy is a scumbag Sincerely proud MAGA supporterWell since he loves cock more than pussy I just hope you’re happy boy in prison hahahaRight wingers are essentially accusing the FBI, and the US Justice Department led by a Republican, and police departments of naively believing thousands of hate crimes occurred, even though cases were investigated, or recorded in department statistics every year.Donald Trump can first apologize for believing the Chicago Police Dept’s statements that Smollett was a credible victim of a hate crime…Actually, the only apology must come from Smollett, and offered to all Americans.Did Reverend Al jump on this one as quick as Tawnay Brayley? May spelled wrong. Money 2 be made Al. Lied never played but ruined lives. Hate crimes happen but clown shoes Jussie lied. Make him repay the man hours wasted and make him a pariah. It won’t happen right Reverend Al? Sorry gotta go get paid off people’s misery. Jussie is shit and I live certain shows on Fox but won’t watch till this idiot is firedJUSSIE WAS FILLED WITH HATE, AND IT LED TO HIS DOWNFALL. GOOD.He has been too lucky, Smollet. Now he betrays his partners in crime to save his stretched ass, and it is despicable. He has taken his lucky break and broken it in two, and it is time to pay the consequences.Hey! Do I hear apologies from anyone? Jussie Smollett? The liberal lawmakers? The liberal so-called celebrities? The liberal candidates for president? Hmmm. No. The silence is deafening.If he lied about the attack? Is that a friggen JOKE?Jussie is obviously a very disturbed, mentally ill young man!! But I believe he did this out of greed, not mental illness!! He wanted to become more famous and make a lot of money. That is just being a very selfish person!! You can even see that he is a selfish, self absorbed, narcissist by looking at his face and the facial expressions he makes!! His face alone says a lot about him, not to mention his LIES!!What a very, very sickening person he is. He makes me want to vomit and I hope he goes to prison and NEVER is allowed to act again!!So if this was a hate crime, does that mean he committed a hate crime against himself?Lets not take this lightly he needs to be held accountable for his hate-instilled actions. Hes already been proven a liar from his past duis. He should be fired and be charged with a hate crime and the idiotic hollywood elite and tv stations and camille Harris that jumped the gun and stood behind the liar just because hes black owe an apology and explanation as to their blatant ignorance and stupidity and predjudice towards white people.WTF?

36,Electoral College,Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections?,2s36q4r,https://mashable.com/article/marijuana-legalization-election-2020/,Every 2020 presidential candidate's stance on marijuana legalization,"If there's one thing that united Democrats and Republicans in the Reagan era (besides their unfortunate fixation with perms), it was their near universal hatred of weed. Everybody was a cop back then. Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate for president in 1984, called for another ""War on Drugs"" — all drugs. Ronald Reagan, for his part, believed that marijuana was ""probably the most dangerous drug in the United States.""Fast forward to the 2020 election, when politicians have largely done an about-face, at least when it comes to weed. Politicians aren't just campaigning for medical marijuana, they're advocating for recreational marijuana to be legalized: explicitly, vocally, and on their campaign pages.Were it not for the hundreds of thousands of people arrested for marijuana law violations every year, it's almost like the past 40 years of aggressive anti-marijuana drug policy didn't exist. Here's what Daniel Mallinson, assistant professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, thinks of the tectonic political and cultural shift on marijuana legalization:""It started in the liberal states. There was a big political shift there that has since shifted to more conservative, battleground states — specifically when it comes to medical marijuana,"" Mallinson told Mashable in a phone interview. ""Even the majority of Republicans now support some form of legalization. That's a rapid political shift among individuals that's now being captured in state policy and brought to the national level.""Recreational marijuana is now legal in 10 states and Washington, DC, while medical marijuana is legal in 33. And the remarkable historical progress is only expected to grow.Mallinson isn't surprised to see Democratic candidates latching onto this issue:""Democrats are all jostling to be the most progressive right now. At least the ones who have declared already,"" Mallison said. ""You have to check a box for marijuana legalization if you want to run in that space."" SEE ALSO: Emergency pet marijuana calls are up by 765%Will recreational marijuana legalization help candidates in the general election? Mallinson isn't so sure. The current 2020 presidential candidates have a range of views on the issue, not all of them exactly alike. Here's where each presidential candidate stands on legalized marijuana, and where they once stood — as much as they might try to deny it. Where the Democratic candidates stand on marijuana legalization Blazin' on through the snow: What's Amy Klobuchar's stance on marijuana?Image: stephen maturen/Getty ImagesMinnesota will be voting on recreational marijuana in 2019. Despite widespread public support, it's unclear whether the bill will pass and where Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar will stand. The candidate from Minnesota is considered one of the more centrist of the pack. And her position on legalization is somewhat more muddled than that of her opponents. Klobuchar has signed onto the ""Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act,"" which protects states that have legalized marijuana from federal meddling. So has Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Unlike Warren, however, Klobuchar has not signed onto the Marijuana Justice Act, which would remove marijuana's classification as a schedule 1 drug in the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Klobuchar has supported cannabis research in the past, especially as it applies to medical research. Although, its classification as a schedule 1 drug makes this nearly impossible. It's much harder for scientists to obtain legal samples of the drug when it's classified this way.Her record on marijuana as Minnesota's Attorney General is much more conservative. In 2016, she was given a ""D"" rating by NORML (the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws), indicating a ""hard on drugs"" stance.  Andrew Yang has called the criminalization of marijuana ""stupid and racist""Image: AFP/Getty ImagesUnless you’re deep in Politics Twitter, chances are you haven’t heard of Andrew Yang, the lawyer and tech entrepreneur. Yang’s home state of New York has already legalized medical marijuana and is poised to legalize recreational marijuana sometime in the near future, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Yang has called the criminalization of marijuana “stupid and racist, particularly now that it's legal in some states.” He believes in full legalization and is fighting to pardon folks who were convicted of non-violent marijuana-related offenses.While Yang isn’t particularly well known, he recently received just enough individual donations to appear in the Democratic primary debates. Yang is also advocating for something he calls The Freedom Dividend, which would provide a guaranteed monthly income of $1000 to every adult above the age of 18 — all on the grounds that automation will eventually wipe out millions of jobs.  Bernie Sanders has one of the most progressive records on marijuana legalization in the Senate.Image: win mcnamee/Getty ImagesVermont Senator Bernie Sanders hails from one of the most liberal states in the country. In 2019, recreational marijuana was made legal in Vermont — not through a referendum, but through a vote in the state legislature. Vermont became the first state in the country to legalize marijuana using this route.Sanders has long advocated for marijuana reform. In 1995, he co-sponsored a bill in the House that would authorize medical marijuana in cases of ""life-threatening"" and ""sense-threatening"" illness. In the decades following, Sanders became one of the most vocal advocates for marijuana reform. Four years ago, Sanders filed the first bill in the Senate to end cannabis prohibition. He has signed onto New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's Marijuana Justice Act and called for the de-scheduling of the drug.Sanders has also demanded banking reform, hoping to make it easier for legal marijuana businesses to operate accounts. In 2016, Sanders became the first major presidential candidate from both parties to call for removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances. He is largely considered to be one of the most marijuana-friendly candidates running for president. Despite coming from a highly conservative state, O'Rourke has long advocated for marijuana reformImage: matt winkelmeyer/Getty Images for SXSWAfter months of dilly-dallying and Instagramming his trips to the dentist, former Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke finally declared his candidacy on March 14, 2019. O’Rourke’s home state of Texas is largely hostile to legal marijuana. Recreational marijuana is banned and medical medical marijuana is severely restricted. In 2015, Texas passed the Compassionate Use Act, giving some people access to low-THC medical marijuana, but only if they were residents of the state and suffered from “intractable epilepsy.”In the past, NORML, which grades politicians on where they stand on marijuana, gave O’Rourke a grade of B+. Despite coming from a conservative state, O’Rourke was an early advocate for marijuana reform. While in Congress, O’Rourke voted for multiple pieces of legislation that would expand medical marijuana and protect states where marijuana was legalized from federal intervention. In March of 2019, O’Rourke called for the federal legalization of marijuana, as well as a wave of criminal justice proposals that would affect those impacted by the drug war. Like Cory Booker, O’Rourke is advocating that people who’ve been incarcerated solely for marijuana possession have their records expunged. And, ahem, here is O’Rourke singing “Roll Me Up And Smoke Me When I Die” with Willie Nelson on stage in the summer of 2018. Booker is one the most vocal advocates for marijuana legalization.Image: scott olson/Getty ImagesNew Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker is one of the more progressive candidates when it comes to marijuana reform. It helps that he comes from a progressive state. In November of of 2018, New Jersey's state Senate and Assembly passed legislation easing the way for marijuana legalization. Governor Phil Murphy is now working with Senate President Stephen Sweeney to establish a more formal path for legalization and government regulation and taxation of the drug.They should have Booker's support. In 2017, Booker authored the Marijuana Reform Act, which had multiple, historic, and radical elements: expunging convictions for those prosecuted for marijuana-related offenses, punishing states for disproportionately targeting groups of people (historically, that's people of color), and legalizing the drug on a federal level.People who were serving federal sentences for marijuana-related offenses would be eligible for re-sentencing, presumably for a lighter sentence.It was a transformational piece of legislation that could have improved the lives of millions of people. But it never made it out of the Senate, thanks to a secure Republican majority.Every current Democratic presidential candidate who is also serving in the Senate has signed onto Booker's legislation, with the exception of Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Unlike other senators on this list, Booker has a strong record on legalization. As far back as 2012, Booker, then mayor of Newark, New Jersey, decried the drug wars, accusing the federal government of ""pouring huge amounts of our public resources into this current effort that is bleeding our public treasury and unnecessarily undermining human potential.""Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren comes from a progressive, marijuana-friendly state, so it's not surprising that she's one of the most vocal advocates for legalization. In 2016, Massachusetts voted to legalize cannabis recreationally and in November of 2018, began selling cannabis to adults. Warren has taken her advocacy to a federal level. Along with Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Warren is one of the lead sponsors of the STATES Act, which protects states in which marijuana is legal from federal interference. Cannabis is still illegal on the federal level.She's also signed onto multiple major drug policy reform bills, including the Marijuana Justice Act, a transformative piece of legislation that would financially punish states that fail to legalize marijuana and who disproportionately incarcerate or arrest people for marijuana-related offenses.Because of the legal status of marijuana on the federal level, cannabis companies are often barred from using federally-backed banks. Like Sanders, Warren has supported cannabis-related banking legislation, designed to push the industry away from cash-only models and integrate it with the modern banking system, where it's safer for businesses and will be better monitored. Warren might look like the model of marijuana reform now, but it wasn't always that way. In her 2013 campaign against Republican Dan Winslow, she came at her opponent with this accusation: ""He has a 100-percent ranking from the gun lobby and he’s for the legalization of marijuana. He wants us armed and stoned."" Washington Governor Jay Inslee is from one of the most marijuana-friendly states in the countryImage: Getty Images for SXSWWashington Governor Jay Inslee is from one of the most marijuana-friendly states in the country. In 1998, Washington became one of the first states to legalize medical marijuana. In 2012, Washington, along with Colorado, became of one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana.Inslee has long been an advocate for legal weed. As a Congressman, Inslee signed multiple pieces of legislation that would protect medical marijuana from federal intervention. As governor, Inslee was an even more vociferous supporter. Earlier this year, Inslee pardoned thousands of individuals who were convicted of possessing a small, misdemeanor-level amounts of marijuana and had no other criminal convictions. In 2012, Inslee was more lukewarm about recreational marijuana and opposed I-502, an initiative which would have legalized the plant. By 2018, however, Inslee had fully evolved, joking to Bill Maher that his home state had the “the best weed in the United States of America.”Inslee has also called out the President for failing to stick to his campaign pledge to leave states who had decriminalized marijuana alone.Among the presidential candidates, Inslee is one of the least known. He is, however, likely to be one of the strongest advocates for legal marijuana among a very crowded field. Joe Biden doesn't have the best history with marijuana reform.Image: Scott Eisen/Getty ImagesUncle Joe isn’t exactly a favorite among marijuana advocates. While most people associate harsh anti-drug policy with Republicans, Biden was one of the chief Democratic architects of the drug war. As a Democratic Senator, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which enacted mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana-related convictions. He was also one of the chief sponsors of the widely criticized 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which ushered in a new era of mass incarceration. And in 2010, Biden called marijuana a “gateway drug.” Not exactly the stuff of legalization advocates’ dreams. However, Biden has evolved with time, noting in January 2019 that some of his aggressive tough-on-drug-crime legislation was a “big mistake that was made.” As Obama’s Vice President, Biden didn’t push for marijuana legalization. He did, however, tell Time Magazine in 2014 that “I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resource.” Biden added that it was “That’s different than [legalization]. Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization, and that is [and] continues to be our policy.”Despite officially announcing his 2020 run on April 25, Biden has yet to announce a stance on marijuana reform.  Julian Castro, a less well-known candidate, has a record as a strong progressive.Image: Edward omelas/Getty ImagesDemocrat Julián Castro hails from Florida, where only medical marijuana is legal. Recreational marijuana legalization is a long way off — advocates are currently working to ease access to medical marijuana, which was only made legal in 2016.Castro previously served in Obama's White House as the Housing and Urban Development Secretary. Consequently, he doesn't have a Congressional voting record on marijuana, making his views a bit harder to decipher.Castro has previously made social media posts in support of at least partial legislation. Two years ago in a Facebook post, he discouraged the federal government from cracking down on recreational marijuana crimes.Castro has also said he supported voters passing marijuana legalization laws by state. It'll be interesting to see how Castro can distinguish himself in an already crowded Democratic field. Kamala Harris has come a long way on marijuana legalization.Image: chip somodevilla/Getty ImagesOh, California Senator Kamala Harris. Harris, who now admits she both smoked marijuana and inhaled it in the past, wasn't always an advocate for legalization. Her home state, meanwhile, has been one of the drug's most vocal advocates: a whopping 57.1 percent of voters voted yes on Proposition 64 in 2017 to legalize marijuana. It took until 2015 for the former attorney general to come out in support of medical marijuana. Back in 2014, she laughed in the face of a local news reporter who asked if she supported legalizing recreational marijuana. Harris has a new book in which she advocates for clearing the criminal records for people convicted of non-violent marijuana offenses, as well as for legalizing the drug.The senator has come a long way from her earlier, more prosecutorial days, but it may not be enough to make some legalization advocates happy. Gillibrand has signed several key pieces of marijuana legalization.Image: alex wong/Getty ImagesNew York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. It's easy for Gillibrand to hold this position, given her home state's support for the drug (New York is poised to become the 11th state to legalize recreational cannabis). And while we personally don't know if she's ever smoked, Gillibrand has signed her name to several key pieces of marijuana reform legislation, including Booker's Marijuana Justice Act.She'e been outspoken about the effects of drug war policy and the racial inequities in the criminal justice system, even prior to announcing her candidacy.After starting her career as a conservative, Blue Dog Democrat, Gillibrand has leaned hard to the left in recent years. I expect her to follow her party's progressive wing on this issue in the years to come. Buttigieg could become America's first openly gay president.Image: alex wong/Getty ImagesPete Buttigieg is one of the least-known potential Democratic candidates on this list. As a result, the chances of him winning the nomination are slim. Buttigieg hasn't spoken on a national stage about his views on marijuana legalization. However, he is largely considered a progressive in the city of South Bend, Indiana, where he serves as mayor. His home state of Indiana is far more conservative: Neither recreational marijuana nor medical marijuana are legal in the state, and progress on the issue has been slow. A representative from Buttigieg's office told Mashable that the mayor supports legalization. Gabbard has one of the most progressive records on marijuana in the House.Image: Getty Images for Teen VogueCurrently, the Hawaiian legislature is considering marijuana legalization. And, questionable views on Assad aside, Hawaiian Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is the one most progressive candidates when it comes to marijuana legislation. According to Marijuana Moment, she was lead sponsor on a bill that would require the government to research the effects of marijuana legalization on a state level. She has called on the federal government to decriminalize marijuana, encouraged the federal government to fund additional research on medical marijuana, publicly explored the relationship between opioid abuse and punitive marijuana laws,  and slammed former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for taking a regressive approach to drug policy.Gabbard is one of the most visible advocates for legalized marijuana in the field, even if her presidential polling numbers are currently very low.

That being said, Pop-Tarts got more likes on Twitter than Starbucks CEO Schultz did when they announced that they were running for president, so I'm not entirely sure we need to be concerned with a Schultz presidency. Because Schultz has no political experience to speak of, his views on the marijuana issue are unclear. He is, however, the founder behind the Frappuccino, which is its own kind of intoxicant. So there's that.We have reached out to Schultz for comment and have not yet received a response. President Trump's official policy position on marijuana is:(*)#$@)$(*$&Image: michael reynolds-pool/Getty ImagesPrior to becoming elected, Trump said he believed marijuana legalization should be left up to the states. In New York, Trump's liberal home state, Governor Andrew Cuomo plans to legalize the recreational drug (medical marijuana is already legal) and establish an Office of Cannabis Management.Upon becoming president, however, Trump appointed Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Sessions proceed to lift a critical Obama-era marijuana policy that made it clear that the federal government would not intervene with states who had legalized marijuana. In 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump administration was considering strengthening anti-marijuana enforcement on a federal level.It's unclear whether the president will be a candidate in 2020, depending on his incarceration status, but it's important to keep his political worldview (absolute ideological chaos) in mind.Even if there's a Democratic president in office, it'll be hard to push comprehensive marijuana reform, depending on the partisan makeup of Congress. Still, it's an exciting time for marijuana advocates. A record 6 in 10 Americans now support legalization, following a decade of steady progress on the issue.

Every 2020 presidential candidate's stance on marijuana legalization If there's one thing that united Democrats and Republicans in the Reagan era (besides their unfortunate fixation with perms), it was their near universal hatred of weed. Everybody was a cop back then. Walter Mondale, the Democratic candidate for president in 1984, called for another ""War on Drugs"" — all drugs. Ronald Reagan, for his part, believed that marijuana was ""probably the most dangerous drug in the United States.""Fast forward to the 2020 election, when politicians have largely done an about-face, at least when it comes to weed. Politicians aren't just campaigning for medical marijuana, they're advocating for recreational marijuana to be legalized: explicitly, vocally, and on their campaign pages.Were it not for the hundreds of thousands of people arrested for marijuana law violations every year, it's almost like the past 40 years of aggressive anti-marijuana drug policy didn't exist. Here's what Daniel Mallinson, assistant professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg, thinks of the tectonic political and cultural shift on marijuana legalization:""It started in the liberal states. There was a big political shift there that has since shifted to more conservative, battleground states — specifically when it comes to medical marijuana,"" Mallinson told Mashable in a phone interview. ""Even the majority of Republicans now support some form of legalization. That's a rapid political shift among individuals that's now being captured in state policy and brought to the national level.""Recreational marijuana is now legal in 10 states and Washington, DC, while medical marijuana is legal in 33. And the remarkable historical progress is only expected to grow.Mallinson isn't surprised to see Democratic candidates latching onto this issue:""Democrats are all jostling to be the most progressive right now. At least the ones who have declared already,"" Mallison said. ""You have to check a box for marijuana legalization if you want to run in that space."" SEE ALSO: Emergency pet marijuana calls are up by 765%Will recreational marijuana legalization help candidates in the general election? Mallinson isn't so sure. The current 2020 presidential candidates have a range of views on the issue, not all of them exactly alike. Here's where each presidential candidate stands on legalized marijuana, and where they once stood — as much as they might try to deny it. Where the Democratic candidates stand on marijuana legalization Blazin' on through the snow: What's Amy Klobuchar's stance on marijuana?Image: stephen maturen/Getty ImagesMinnesota will be voting on recreational marijuana in 2019. Despite widespread public support, it's unclear whether the bill will pass and where Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar will stand. The candidate from Minnesota is considered one of the more centrist of the pack. And her position on legalization is somewhat more muddled than that of her opponents. Klobuchar has signed onto the ""Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act,"" which protects states that have legalized marijuana from federal meddling. So has Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Unlike Warren, however, Klobuchar has not signed onto the Marijuana Justice Act, which would remove marijuana's classification as a schedule 1 drug in the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Klobuchar has supported cannabis research in the past, especially as it applies to medical research. Although, its classification as a schedule 1 drug makes this nearly impossible. It's much harder for scientists to obtain legal samples of the drug when it's classified this way.Her record on marijuana as Minnesota's Attorney General is much more conservative. In 2016, she was given a ""D"" rating by NORML (the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws), indicating a ""hard on drugs"" stance.  Andrew Yang has called the criminalization of marijuana ""stupid and racist""Image: AFP/Getty ImagesUnless you’re deep in Politics Twitter, chances are you haven’t heard of Andrew Yang, the lawyer and tech entrepreneur. Yang’s home state of New York has already legalized medical marijuana and is poised to legalize recreational marijuana sometime in the near future, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Yang has called the criminalization of marijuana “stupid and racist, particularly now that it's legal in some states.” He believes in full legalization and is fighting to pardon folks who were convicted of non-violent marijuana-related offenses.While Yang isn’t particularly well known, he recently received just enough individual donations to appear in the Democratic primary debates. Yang is also advocating for something he calls The Freedom Dividend, which would provide a guaranteed monthly income of $1000 to every adult above the age of 18 — all on the grounds that automation will eventually wipe out millions of jobs.  Bernie Sanders has one of the most progressive records on marijuana legalization in the Senate.Image: win mcnamee/Getty ImagesVermont Senator Bernie Sanders hails from one of the most liberal states in the country. In 2019, recreational marijuana was made legal in Vermont — not through a referendum, but through a vote in the state legislature. Vermont became the first state in the country to legalize marijuana using this route.Sanders has long advocated for marijuana reform. In 1995, he co-sponsored a bill in the House that would authorize medical marijuana in cases of ""life-threatening"" and ""sense-threatening"" illness. In the decades following, Sanders became one of the most vocal advocates for marijuana reform. Four years ago, Sanders filed the first bill in the Senate to end cannabis prohibition. He has signed onto New Jersey Senator Cory Booker's Marijuana Justice Act and called for the de-scheduling of the drug.Sanders has also demanded banking reform, hoping to make it easier for legal marijuana businesses to operate accounts. In 2016, Sanders became the first major presidential candidate from both parties to call for removing marijuana from the list of controlled substances. He is largely considered to be one of the most marijuana-friendly candidates running for president. Despite coming from a highly conservative state, O'Rourke has long advocated for marijuana reformImage: matt winkelmeyer/Getty Images for SXSWAfter months of dilly-dallying and Instagramming his trips to the dentist, former Democratic Congressman Beto O’Rourke finally declared his candidacy on March 14, 2019. O’Rourke’s home state of Texas is largely hostile to legal marijuana. Recreational marijuana is banned and medical medical marijuana is severely restricted. In 2015, Texas passed the Compassionate Use Act, giving some people access to low-THC medical marijuana, but only if they were residents of the state and suffered from “intractable epilepsy.”In the past, NORML, which grades politicians on where they stand on marijuana, gave O’Rourke a grade of B+. Despite coming from a conservative state, O’Rourke was an early advocate for marijuana reform. While in Congress, O’Rourke voted for multiple pieces of legislation that would expand medical marijuana and protect states where marijuana was legalized from federal intervention. In March of 2019, O’Rourke called for the federal legalization of marijuana, as well as a wave of criminal justice proposals that would affect those impacted by the drug war. Like Cory Booker, O’Rourke is advocating that people who’ve been incarcerated solely for marijuana possession have their records expunged. And, ahem, here is O’Rourke singing “Roll Me Up And Smoke Me When I Die” with Willie Nelson on stage in the summer of 2018. Booker is one the most vocal advocates for marijuana legalization.Image: scott olson/Getty ImagesNew Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker is one of the more progressive candidates when it comes to marijuana reform. It helps that he comes from a progressive state. In November of of 2018, New Jersey's state Senate and Assembly passed legislation easing the way for marijuana legalization. Governor Phil Murphy is now working with Senate President Stephen Sweeney to establish a more formal path for legalization and government regulation and taxation of the drug.They should have Booker's support. In 2017, Booker authored the Marijuana Reform Act, which had multiple, historic, and radical elements: expunging convictions for those prosecuted for marijuana-related offenses, punishing states for disproportionately targeting groups of people (historically, that's people of color), and legalizing the drug on a federal level.People who were serving federal sentences for marijuana-related offenses would be eligible for re-sentencing, presumably for a lighter sentence.It was a transformational piece of legislation that could have improved the lives of millions of people. But it never made it out of the Senate, thanks to a secure Republican majority.Every current Democratic presidential candidate who is also serving in the Senate has signed onto Booker's legislation, with the exception of Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. Unlike other senators on this list, Booker has a strong record on legalization. As far back as 2012, Booker, then mayor of Newark, New Jersey, decried the drug wars, accusing the federal government of ""pouring huge amounts of our public resources into this current effort that is bleeding our public treasury and unnecessarily undermining human potential.""Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren comes from a progressive, marijuana-friendly state, so it's not surprising that she's one of the most vocal advocates for legalization. In 2016, Massachusetts voted to legalize cannabis recreationally and in November of 2018, began selling cannabis to adults. Warren has taken her advocacy to a federal level. Along with Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, Warren is one of the lead sponsors of the STATES Act, which protects states in which marijuana is legal from federal interference. Cannabis is still illegal on the federal level.She's also signed onto multiple major drug policy reform bills, including the Marijuana Justice Act, a transformative piece of legislation that would financially punish states that fail to legalize marijuana and who disproportionately incarcerate or arrest people for marijuana-related offenses.Because of the legal status of marijuana on the federal level, cannabis companies are often barred from using federally-backed banks. Like Sanders, Warren has supported cannabis-related banking legislation, designed to push the industry away from cash-only models and integrate it with the modern banking system, where it's safer for businesses and will be better monitored. Warren might look like the model of marijuana reform now, but it wasn't always that way. In her 2013 campaign against Republican Dan Winslow, she came at her opponent with this accusation: ""He has a 100-percent ranking from the gun lobby and he’s for the legalization of marijuana. He wants us armed and stoned."" Washington Governor Jay Inslee is from one of the most marijuana-friendly states in the countryImage: Getty Images for SXSWWashington Governor Jay Inslee is from one of the most marijuana-friendly states in the country. In 1998, Washington became one of the first states to legalize medical marijuana. In 2012, Washington, along with Colorado, became of one of the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana.Inslee has long been an advocate for legal weed. As a Congressman, Inslee signed multiple pieces of legislation that would protect medical marijuana from federal intervention. As governor, Inslee was an even more vociferous supporter. Earlier this year, Inslee pardoned thousands of individuals who were convicted of possessing a small, misdemeanor-level amounts of marijuana and had no other criminal convictions. In 2012, Inslee was more lukewarm about recreational marijuana and opposed I-502, an initiative which would have legalized the plant. By 2018, however, Inslee had fully evolved, joking to Bill Maher that his home state had the “the best weed in the United States of America.”Inslee has also called out the President for failing to stick to his campaign pledge to leave states who had decriminalized marijuana alone.Among the presidential candidates, Inslee is one of the least known. He is, however, likely to be one of the strongest advocates for legal marijuana among a very crowded field. Joe Biden doesn't have the best history with marijuana reform.Image: Scott Eisen/Getty ImagesUncle Joe isn’t exactly a favorite among marijuana advocates. While most people associate harsh anti-drug policy with Republicans, Biden was one of the chief Democratic architects of the drug war. As a Democratic Senator, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which enacted mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana-related convictions. He was also one of the chief sponsors of the widely criticized 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which ushered in a new era of mass incarceration. And in 2010, Biden called marijuana a “gateway drug.” Not exactly the stuff of legalization advocates’ dreams. However, Biden has evolved with time, noting in January 2019 that some of his aggressive tough-on-drug-crime legislation was a “big mistake that was made.” As Obama’s Vice President, Biden didn’t push for marijuana legalization. He did, however, tell Time Magazine in 2014 that “I think the idea of focusing significant resources on interdicting or convicting people for smoking marijuana is a waste of our resource.” Biden added that it was “That’s different than [legalization]. Our policy for our Administration is still not legalization, and that is [and] continues to be our policy.”Despite officially announcing his 2020 run on April 25, Biden has yet to announce a stance on marijuana reform.  Julian Castro, a less well-known candidate, has a record as a strong progressive.Image: Edward omelas/Getty ImagesDemocrat Julián Castro hails from Florida, where only medical marijuana is legal. Recreational marijuana legalization is a long way off — advocates are currently working to ease access to medical marijuana, which was only made legal in 2016.Castro previously served in Obama's White House as the Housing and Urban Development Secretary. Consequently, he doesn't have a Congressional voting record on marijuana, making his views a bit harder to decipher.Castro has previously made social media posts in support of at least partial legislation. Two years ago in a Facebook post, he discouraged the federal government from cracking down on recreational marijuana crimes.Castro has also said he supported voters passing marijuana legalization laws by state. It'll be interesting to see how Castro can distinguish himself in an already crowded Democratic field. Kamala Harris has come a long way on marijuana legalization.Image: chip somodevilla/Getty ImagesOh, California Senator Kamala Harris. Harris, who now admits she both smoked marijuana and inhaled it in the past, wasn't always an advocate for legalization. Her home state, meanwhile, has been one of the drug's most vocal advocates: a whopping 57.1 percent of voters voted yes on Proposition 64 in 2017 to legalize marijuana. It took until 2015 for the former attorney general to come out in support of medical marijuana. Back in 2014, she laughed in the face of a local news reporter who asked if she supported legalizing recreational marijuana. Harris has a new book in which she advocates for clearing the criminal records for people convicted of non-violent marijuana offenses, as well as for legalizing the drug.The senator has come a long way from her earlier, more prosecutorial days, but it may not be enough to make some legalization advocates happy. Gillibrand has signed several key pieces of marijuana legalization.Image: alex wong/Getty ImagesNew York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. It's easy for Gillibrand to hold this position, given her home state's support for the drug (New York is poised to become the 11th state to legalize recreational cannabis). And while we personally don't know if she's ever smoked, Gillibrand has signed her name to several key pieces of marijuana reform legislation, including Booker's Marijuana Justice Act.She'e been outspoken about the effects of drug war policy and the racial inequities in the criminal justice system, even prior to announcing her candidacy.After starting her career as a conservative, Blue Dog Democrat, Gillibrand has leaned hard to the left in recent years. I expect her to follow her party's progressive wing on this issue in the years to come.

12,School Uniforms,Should Students Have to Wear School Uniforms?,1s12q3r,http://theconversation.com/does-wearing-a-school-uniform-improve-student-behavior-51553,Does wearing a school uniform improve student behavior?,"Professor of Education, and Professor of Justice Studies, University of New Hampshire Todd A. DeMitchell does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.View all partners Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons license. In a growing number of school districts across the nation, students must wear a uniform.This is not the stereotypical school uniform associated with Catholic schools – pleated plaid skirt with a blouse for girls; a button-down shirt, a necktie and dark pants for boys. Instead, these are mostly khaki and blue or khaki and red shirt/blouse and skirt/pants uniforms. According to the US Department of Education, wearing a uniform can decrease the risk of violence and theft, instill discipline and help school officials recognize intruders who come to the school.As a former teacher, principal and superintendent and now a policy and law scholar, I am skeptical about such claims.Research on the effects of school uniforms is still nascent. And the findings on the impact of school uniforms on student behavior, discipline, connection to the school, attendance and academic gains is at best mixed. About half of schools around the country have dress codes policies. A dress code identifies what clothes cannot be worn to school. A school uniform policy defines what clothes must be worn to school. Dress codes limit clothing options while school uniforms define clothing options. Schools claim that when students come in uniforms, it improves discipline and leads to academic gains. The Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana enacted a uniform policy in 2001 in order to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems. However, such mandatory policies that decide what students can or cannot wear to schools, have led to free speech violations lawsuits. Students allege such policies are unconstitutional, as they restrict their freedom of expression. There have been nine lawsuits up to 2014. School districts have won almost all the cases, except one, where an appeals court found the uniform policy of a Nevada school unconstitutional. The school required students to wear shirts emblazoned with the school motto, “Tomorrow’s Leaders,” which the court found to be a violation of students’ free speech rights. In addition, students have protested in their schools as well.An example of student and parental reaction to school uniforms is found in my home state of New Hampshire when Pinkerton Academy, a private secondary school, considered adopting a “uniform dress code” (a school uniform). Students in an online protest wrote:[A school uniform] takes away individuality. Also, [it] will not change study habits of students. [It means] too much money [needs to be spent] for each child. Parents do not have that type of money, especially in this economy. We have the right to freedom of expression and would like to keep it that way.“ [And] ""its [sic] my right to wake up in the morning and have my own unique individuality.” A more important question is whether there is any evidence to show that mandatory uniform policies can lead to improved student outcomes. Research shows mixed results: it’s true that some studies show a reduction in the incidence of misbehavior. But then, there are others that show an increase in student suspensions. A few others show no significant change in student misbehavior.For example, a 2010 study in a large urban school district in the Southwest found that asking students to wear uniforms did not result in any change in the number of suspensions for elementary school students. In fact, middle and high school students experienced a significant increase in suspensions.By contrast, a 2003 study that used a large national data set concluded that elementary and middle schools with school uniforms had fewer student behavior problems. But, again, it found that high schools had a greater frequency of misbehavior. Interestingly, even when evidence is available, educators’ perceptions could be at odds with it. For example, a study of educators in 38 North Carolina high schools found that 61% of the responding principals and assistant principals believed that there was a reduction in cases of misbehavior on campus when school uniforms were introduced. In reality, the data showed no change in incidents of crime, violence and suspensions.Similarly, research on the efficacy of school uniforms on increasing student attendance and achievement is conflicted. For example, one study concluded that school uniforms resulted in increased student achievement and increased attendance. However, another study found little impact on academics at all levels and little evidence of improvement in attendance for girls and drop in attendance for boys.So, what does lack of consistent research mean for policy?In my view, it does not mean that schools should not implement such policies. It does mean, however, that educators must be clear about the goals that they hope to achieve with mandating school uniforms.There is often a cost associated with mandatory school uniform policies. Lawsuits and community reactions can take up scarce resources of time and money.Decreased discipline problems, increased attendance and increased academic achievement may not be achieved just by wearing khaki and blue. But there may be other benefits, such as, it could help a school promote its brand through a uniform look. School uniform may also serve as symbol of commitment to academic achievement.The point is that clarity of purpose and outcome is necessary before students don their uniform in the morning. I believe school uniforms may be part of a broad array of programs and approaches that a school may adopt to bring change. However, as a standalone measure, it implies that schools are simply trying to find an easy fix for difficult and complex problems.School uniforms alone cannot bring about a sustained or large-scale change.Comments on this article are now closed.

According to the US Department of Education, wearing a uniform can decrease the risk of violence and theft, instill discipline and help school officials recognize intruders who come to the school.As a former teacher, principal and superintendent and now a policy and law scholar, I am skeptical about such claims.Research on the effects of school uniforms is still nascent. And the findings on the impact of school uniforms on student behavior, discipline, connection to the school, attendance and academic gains is at best mixed. About half of schools around the country have dress codes policies. A dress code identifies what clothes cannot be worn to school. A school uniform policy defines what clothes must be worn to school. Dress codes limit clothing options while school uniforms define clothing options. Schools claim that when students come in uniforms, it improves discipline and leads to academic gains. The Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana enacted a uniform policy in 2001 in order to increase test scores and reduce disciplinary problems. However, such mandatory policies that decide what students can or cannot wear to schools, have led to free speech violations lawsuits. Students allege such policies are unconstitutional, as they restrict their freedom of expression. There have been nine lawsuits up to 2014. School districts have won almost all the cases, except one, where an appeals court found the uniform policy of a Nevada school unconstitutional. The school required students to wear shirts emblazoned with the school motto, “Tomorrow’s Leaders,” which the court found to be a violation of students’ free speech rights. In addition, students have protested in their schools as well.An example of student and parental reaction to school uniforms is found in my home state of New Hampshire when Pinkerton Academy, a private secondary school, considered adopting a “uniform dress code” (a school uniform). Students in an online protest wrote:[A school uniform] takes away individuality. Also, [it] will not change study habits of students. [It means] too much money [needs to be spent] for each child. Parents do not have that type of money, especially in this economy. We have the right to freedom of expression and would like to keep it that way.“ [And] ""its [sic] my right to wake up in the morning and have my own unique individuality.” A more important question is whether there is any evidence to show that mandatory uniform policies can lead to improved student outcomes. Research shows mixed results: it’s true that some studies show a reduction in the incidence of misbehavior. But then, there are others that show an increase in student suspensions. A few others show no significant change in student misbehavior.For example, a 2010 study in a large urban school district in the Southwest found that asking students to wear uniforms did not result in any change in the number of suspensions for elementary school students. In fact, middle and high school students experienced a significant increase in suspensions.By contrast, a 2003 study that used a large national data set concluded that elementary and middle schools with school uniforms had fewer student behavior problems. But, again, it found that high schools had a greater frequency of misbehavior. Interestingly, even when evidence is available, educators’ perceptions could be at odds with it. For example, a study of educators in 38 North Carolina high schools found that 61% of the responding principals and assistant principals believed that there was a reduction in cases of misbehavior on campus when school uniforms were introduced. In reality, the data showed no change in incidents of crime, violence and suspensions.Similarly, research on the efficacy of school uniforms on increasing student attendance and achievement is conflicted. For example, one study concluded that school uniforms resulted in increased student achievement and increased attendance. However, another study found little impact on academics at all levels and little evidence of improvement in attendance for girls and drop in attendance for boys.So, what does lack of consistent research mean for policy?In my view, it does not mean that schools should not implement such policies. It does mean, however, that educators must be clear about the goals that they hope to achieve with mandating school uniforms.There is often a cost associated with mandatory school uniform policies. Lawsuits and community reactions can take up scarce resources of time and money.Decreased discipline problems, increased attendance and increased academic achievement may not be achieved just by wearing khaki and blue. But there may be other benefits, such as, it could help a school promote its brand through a uniform look. School uniform may also serve as symbol of commitment to academic achievement.The point is that clarity of purpose and outcome is necessary before students don their uniform in the morning. I believe school uniforms may be part of a broad array of programs and approaches that a school may adopt to bring change. However, as a standalone measure, it implies that schools are simply trying to find an easy fix for difficult and complex problems.School uniforms alone cannot bring about a sustained or large-scale change.Comments on this article are now closed.

Yet this is not true provided that the revenue is not refunded exactly as collected.  If paying an extra $50 tax increases our climate dividend by exactly $50, then the refund cancels the tax.  If I pay an extra $50 tax, it will be divided among more than 100 million households, so practically speaking I get none of it back.A carbon tax makes economic sense, particularly if we eliminate other climate change regulations and alternative fuels subsidies.

In a speech he will make to the annual Oil and Money conference in London, van Beurden will again urge governments to place a price on carbon emissions in order to reduce coal consumption in favour of the less polluting natural gas. “I know that some people would like fossil fuels to be replaced by renewables as we speak. But for technical and economic reasons, this can only happen step by step. And it will not happen across the board,” van Beurden is set to say. Heavy industry, heavy duty transport and chemical manufacturers will continue to require hydrocarbons to operate, he added. Van Beurden said that an effective carbon pricing system would also boost the economic incentives for cleaner technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). “In my view, the issue is essentially about finding economic ways to invest in an energy transition. This is why governments should take the opportunity to put a price on carbon,” he is to say. “By taking the costs of tackling climate change and air pollution into account, carbon pricing systems will drive the right behaviour of consumers and producers.” Shell was among six of Europe’s largest oil and gas companies to urge governments around the world to introduce a price on carbon emissions at the United Nations Paris climate conference in December, where governments will try to agree on a way to limit global warming. Setting a price for each tonne of carbon that emitters produce is meant to encourage companies to adopt cleaner technologies and shift away from using fossil fuels, primarily coal.

Shell has reduced its operating costs by $4 billion or around 10 percent in the first half of 2015 as costs return to levels last seen in 2011, he will say.

Spot palladium was 1.9 percent higher at $1,484 per ounce by 2:12 p.m. EST (1912 GMT), having earlier soared to an all-time high of $1,491. A sustained deficit in supply was likely to widen this year as stricter emissions standards increase demand for catalytic converters, Britain-based autocatalyst manufacturer Johnson Matthey said last week. Adding to an already strained supply scenario for palladium, was the likelihood of an improvement in demand from the auto sector, given the expectations of a U.S.-China trade deal materializing, said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities in Toronto. “If we were already high and tight when the demand environment didn’t look all that promising, we are certainly going to get tighter when demand improves,” he said. A new round of trade talks between Washington and Beijing was scheduled for Tuesday. While both platinum and palladium are primarily used by automakers in catalytic converters, platinum is more heavily used in diesel vehicles, which have fallen out of favour since Volkswagen’s emissions-rigging scandal broke in 2015. Unlike platinum, palladium has benefited from the switch away from diesel engines and expectations for growth in hybrid electric vehicles, which tend to be partly gasoline-powered. This has helped cushion the metal from falling car sales globally. However, analysts said palladium has risen too fast too soon and was bound for a correction. “Palladium is a bubble and is moving much above what fundamentals suggest,” said Gianclaudio Torlizzi, managing director at consultancy T-Commodity in Milan. Meanwhile, the dollar backed away from a two-month high hit last week on increasing optimism for a breakthrough in the trade talks, bolstering appeal for gold. Spot gold gained 1 percent to $1,339.50 per ounce, having earlier touched its highest since April 20 at $1,341.78. U.S. gold futures settled up 1.7 percent at $1,344.8. “We are getting more evidence of slowing (global) growth,” said SP Angel analyst Sergey Raevskiy. “There were some dovish comments from Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank.” Dovish signals from Japan’s central bank and the ECB compounded worries over a global slowdown, and followed weak data from the United States and China. Also, investors will scan the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting on Wednesday for more guidance on interest rate increases this year. Higher rates tend to weigh on non-yielding gold. Among other precious metals, platinum gained 1.8 percent to $816 per ounce, while silver rose 1.2 percent to $15.99. (Additional reporting by K.

I think that animals should not be used for scientific or commercial purposes for a variety of reasons. To begin, testing is cruel and inhumane. Additionally, alternative testing methods now exist that can replace the need for animals. Reason why animals should not be used for scientific or commercial testing is because it is cruel and inhuman. according to, the humane society international “ they force feed and force inhalation the animals during experiments”(p.1). When force feeding animals it can lead to injuries and effects the animals simply means that it is against their will and it can lead to many things, such as death of the animal or cause serious injuries.Animals can become sick or cause traumatic effect that can last long term. Animals are not humans that can consent to anything so, if the animal is suffering we have no way of knowing if they had enough or not. Additionally, force feeding an animal can lead to death or bruises, lacerations, and sores. Additionally, infliction of burns and other wounds are made to the animals when studying the healing process.the US Department of Agriculture reported in 2010 that 97,123 animals suffered pain during experiments for scientific and commercial testing. During testing when animals have some burns during injection hurts even to humans and when something burns it really hurt so we should not hurt or give animals wounds. The US Department of Agriculture reported in 2009 that 98,200 animals was wounded during experiments for scientific and commercial testing. When animals suffer pain it lead to many thing like (stressful,monotonous,and unnatural lives of daily confinement and deprivation). Every year in the U.S, over 25 million animals are used to biomedical experimentation,product and cosmetic testing, and science education.This includes- dogs,cats,ferrets,rabbits,pigs,sheep,monkeys,chimpanzees and more.However, the majority of animals in lab ( over 90 percent ) are rats,mice, and birds. Some estimate place them in to hundreds of millions. Some people are in favor of animal testing because is easier for them and they want to know more about animals like ( what's in them, what they can do and can't, etc), so thats why some people are in favor of animal testing In conclusion I think animals should not be used for scientific or commercial testing because.Animals should not be use for experiments.If you keep on using the animal it would go endanhered and go and go extinct.It will mess up the food chain: the fox eats the rabbits and we eat the fox so if the rabbits are use for experiments than te fox will not have any food to eat.And keeping on using animals for experiments .But if the drugs and medical treatmens actually harm people,the purpose has been defeated and lab animals are still dead.So we need to stop using animals for experiments cause it is waht we eat when sometimes protects us and we play with and when we keep on using them for experiments there will not be anymore in some years.This article has 0 comments.Copyright © 2019 Teen InkWhich of your works would you like to tell your friends about?
