54,Social Security Privatization,Should Social Security Be Privatized?,1s54q9r,https://townhall.com/columnists/howardrich/2011/03/10/social-security-why-america-can-and-should-allow-private-accounts-n1168922,Social Security: Why America Can and Should Allow Private Accounts,"The Social Security debate is no different than the debate over any other government program – there are just a lot more zeroes involved. Of course the more zeroes, the less willing Washington politicians usually are to confront the problem – particularly when so-called “guaranteed” benefits are at stake. Still, there are three simple questions that can be asked of any government program – including Social Security – which if answered honestly will point us in the direction of sensible, sustainable reforms. First, is the outcome the program seeks to achieve consistent with the founding ideals of this country (i.e. advancing liberty and prosperity for all people)? Second, is government’s involvement absolutely necessary in order to achieve this outcome? And finally (assuming the answer to the first two questions is ‘yes’), should government’s role in achieving the outcome consist of directly funding or managing a particular task? Or should the private sector bear that responsibility – with government assuming a more limited oversight or regulatory role? The men who founded this nation – who risked their lives and liberties in order to break free from a repressive government – carefully weighed similar questions. It was important for them to enumerate and prioritize government’s responsibilities – and just as importantly to spell out its limitations. Otherwise the “more perfect union” they were creating risked becoming every bit as repressive as the government it was replacing. Today, politicians rarely take into account these considerations. Our entitlement culture has created a new definition of “core” government functions – one that goes far beyond the scope of the U.S. Constitution and which relies on trillions of borrowed dollars to sustain. In defending the creation of “Obamacare” – yet another unsustainable government entitlement – a former Democratic Majority Whip summed up the prevailing sentiment when he said “there’s nothing in the Constitution that says the federal government has anything to do with most of the stuff we do.” Truer words have never been spoken – of course this rare moment of entitlement honesty is buried beneath an avalanche of big government lies. These politicians also claim that Social Security is an inviolable “contract” between the government and beneficiaries of the program – classifying expenditures related to the program as “mandatory.” Both of these characterizations are false. “Entitlement to Social Security benefits is not a contractual right,” the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1960. Government has the authority to cut Social Security benefits anytime it wants – just as it has previously exercised the authority to expand those benefits on multiple occasions. But now that Social Security is on the verge of insolvency benefits must be cut – or else taxes will have to be raised. There is simply no “third way” when it comes to managing the “third rail,” at least not if we limit our solutions within the current (government) framework. In fact for every year that this problem is ignored, the benefit cuts and tax hikes necessary to bring Social Security into fiscal alignment grow steeper – while the looming implosion creeps closer. A decade ago the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculated that entitlement spending – including Social Security – would completely absorb the federal budget by the year 2060. Today that estimate has been moved forward by thirty-five years to 2025. Obviously sustaining the prosperity of the American people through their retirement years is a concept that is entirely consistent with our nation’s founding ideals. But that doesn’t mean this worthwhile objective is government’s responsibility – and even if it were, it certainly doesn’t mean that a government program is the best method of accomplishing that goal. In fact as far as retirement savings are concerned, government produces a lousy rate of return compared to the private sector – and has demonstrated a chronic inability to manage its assets efficiently. No wonder studies have shown that the even the lowest-risk voluntary private accounts (those equally weighted in treasuries and bonds) would produce a rate of return three times as high as Social Security – and that’s assuming higher-than-anticipated management fees. Higher returns mean additional consumer spending. Not only that, money which is currently subsidizing unnecessary government consumption would instead be used to grow the economy. Permitting private accounts for Social Security would not break a contract with the American people – it would efficiently fulfill one of the founding ideals of our Republic. It would also help pull our nation back from the brink of economic ruin. And without putting too fine a point on it, there simply aren’t any other options that don’t involve wrecking our economy.

28,Alternative Energy vs. Fossil Fuels,Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?,2s28q5r,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/trumps-speech-ignored-global-warming-and-climate-disasters-but-americans-are-more-worried-than-ever,"Trump’s speech ignored global warming and climate disasters, but Americans are more worried than ever | PBS NewsHour","Listen to our new podcast, 'The Last Continent'Listen to our new podcast, ‘The Last Continent’ Through the first nine months of 2018, the U.S. had experienced nearly a dozen weather and climate disasters with damages costing more than $1 billion. This tally already placed fourth — behind 2017, 2011 and 2016 — among four decades of disaster rankings. And that was before California’s Camp and Woolsey Fires struck on the same day in November, killing dozens of people and capping off a year that left much of the American West scorched. The deadly events sparked national conversations about the ways climate change has made wildfires more extreme, as last year churned out the fourth warmest temperatures on record.But when President Donald Trump headed to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for his second State of the Union address, he made no mention of these disasters — nor did he mention global warming and climate change. (In her Democratic response to the State of the Union, Stacey Abrams listed climate change as a threat to American democracy.)Trump’s omission of global warming and climate change isn’t necessarily a surprise. But the speech aims to set national priorities, and last year, global warming and climate change were of growing importance to the American people. More Americans than ever — 73 percent — believe global warming is happening. As you might expect, Democratic concerns on the topic have increased over time — but they have too for conservative Republicans, according to end-of-2018 polling released Tuesday by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. The polling surveyed liberal Democrats, moderate Democrats, moderate Republicans, conservative Republicans and independents.More conservative Republicans are worried now about global warming than they have been in nearly a decade, the polling said. “Even though Trump continues to cast doubts on climate change,” and his administration has taken action to undermine climate change efforts, “we see that even conservative Republicans — his base — are moving in the opposite direction, at least in the past year,” said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. While the share of conservative Republicans worried about global warming — 32 percent — is less than half of concerned Democrats and independents, this polling represents a reversal from Trump’s first year in office, when acceptance of climate change dropped among the GOP, according to Yale-George Mason polling. (Reminder: Republican-voting counties and congressional districts are more susceptible to climate harm, and 2018’s climate disasters forced evacuations for millions in purple states like Florida and North Carolina.) And, even if Trump had mentioned climate change in the State of the Union, policy action takes more than an 82 minute address. The PBS NewsHour spoke with energy and climate advocates about how they want Trump and the union to approach these issues in 2019 and beyond. Media coverage has described the Democratic-proposed Green New Deal as “a massive program of investments in clean-energy jobs and infrastructure,” “the revenge of the millennials,” and “a Trojan horse of socialist fantasies.” But it could also be a bipartisan bridge. The Green New Deal would push a transition toward clean energy through targeted investments in grid infrastructure, energy efficiency and the green economy, rather than relying solely on market-based solutions like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade. In December, a Yale-George Mason poll reported 81 percent of Americans approved of the proposal. The support crossed party lines, with 92 percent of Democrats, 88 percent of independents and 64 percent of Republicans saying they backed the plan. That support came despite weak brand recognition — fewer than one in five people polled said they had heard anything about the “Green New Deal.” Poll respondents voiced similar support for carbon-reduction proposals like a carbon tax and former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan. Last year, the Trump administration announced plans to roll back the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to cut carbon emissions at new and existing power plants — part of a broader mission to roll back or loosen regulations across industries. “The original Obama Clean Power Plan still does very well [in polling], even when you say there will be a cost to companies, or to consumers and companies, and that includes about half of Republicans,” Leiserowitz said. “Likewise, a revenue-neutral carbon tax continues to get strong overall support, plus about half of Republicans.”Though a growing number of Americans express support for a shift to green energy, a smaller but sizeable pool still wants fossil fuels. Forty-eight percent of registered voters — including 30 percent of Democrats, 49 percent of independents and 72 percent of Republicans — support the expansion of offshore drilling. This paradox may explain why American voters cast their blame broadly when it comes to climate change. When asked who should be doing “more” or “much more” to address global warming, most Americans — three of four — fault corporations and industry, which produce a substantial amount of the greenhouse gases that propel global warming. But nearly the same number — 67 to 68 percent — blame themselves, Congress and the president.America’s energy industry, for its part, has continued its trend of reducing carbon emissions despite the Trump administration’s plans to leave the Paris climate accord. Since then, the U.S. has outpaced other countries still in the Paris accord on reducing emissions — partly through the adoption of renewable energy, but also as a surge in natural gas increasingly replaced coal usage. “There’s really an amazing success story across many sectors, particularly in the oil and gas arena,” said Tom Pyle, the president of the Institute for Energy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. “We’re probably going to become the No. 1 energy exporter this year ahead of schedule, in large part due to the explosion of economic activity in the Permian Basin and the Bakken region.”The Permian Basin in Texas now produces more oil than every OPEC nation aside from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, as The New York Times reported Monday, while North Dakota’s Bakken region set new records for natural gas production in 2017 and 2018. Last year, the U.S. also surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia in oil production, which Pyle said keeps profits away “from hostile regimes and dictatorships.” Trump has “done yeoman’s work” for the energy industry, Pyle said, pointing to changes that have relaxed regulations on coal, oil and natural gas and expanded mining and drilling on federal land.

Photo by REUTERS/Nick OxfordPyle said the president is readying another executive order that will help prevent future bottlenecks of the Keystone pipeline, which has been halted by legal battles. “That just signals from my perspective that the administration is still focused on making America a strong hand in global energy markets, particularly oil and gas,” he addedHe looks forward to Trump’s recent proposals on the energy efficiency of power plants and vehicles moving through the regulatory process in 2019. The natural gas boom since 2005 has bolstered the U.S. economy and reduced consumer energy prices. But every day, the nation slides farther from achieving carbon sustainability and preventing future climate disasters. Paying lower electricity prices due to natural gas isn’t a bad thing, said Rob Cowin, the director of government affairs for the Climate & Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. But those prices don’t account for the damage caused by climate change, he said.“There are other costs baked into those prices that we’re actually bearing, and it’s the most economically vulnerable populations that are bearing them disproportionately,” Cowin said. As the costs of climate change continue to rise, it becomes harder to argue that burning more coal and natural gas is cost effective, he said. Cowin noted that last year’s drop in energy prices also paralleled an aggressive decline in the cost of solar and wind power, making them the cheapest new energy products in many parts of the country. “Last year specifically you really saw the emergence of offshore wind as a new renewable energy technology,” Cowin said, though he worries this boom could be stymied at the end of 2019, as tax credits for the renewables sector begin phasing out. The Trump administration has taken some steps to boost renewable energy, especially with Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s promotion of energy storage, Cowin said. The Department of Energy has ramped up investments and created new programs geared toward innovations in batteries — something that will be crucial if the U.S. wants to avoid gaps in renewables energy production caused by poor weather. Heavy seas engulf Rhode Island’s Block Island wind farm, the first U.S. offshore wind warm. Photo by Energy.gov/FlickrBut the White House has also pursued policies hostile to clean energy, Cowin said, such as a plan outlined in a leaked presidential memo last June. Under the plan, the energy department would use emergency authority to order purchases of electricity from coal and nuclear plants, though the Republican-led Federal Electricity Regulatory Commission had canned similar subsidies six months earlier. Cowin said the department of energy has also been slow to decentralize the energy grid, which favors fossil fuel plants over renewables-powered microgrids. “With grid modernization, they still have a mentality of baseload power, when we know that distributed generation is emerging,” Cowin said. “Their whole philosophy is really about going backwards to the industrial revolution with these old dirty technologies.”While most registered voters want policies that reduce carbon pollution, only half believe they can change the decisions of their local governments and businesses, according to Yale-George Mason polling. The numbers slide downward for those who feel confident that they can influence state, federal and corporate actions. Part of this dismay centers around people being tired of the bickering between opponents in the energy debate.The discussion has become so polarized and so tribal that “most camps are demanding 100 percent concessions from the other side. We don’t buy into that,” said Kyle Meyaard-Schaap, the national organizer and spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate Change.Meyaard-Schaap argues the U.S. can effectively mitigate greenhouse gas emissions at the levels called for by climate scientists by decarbonizing the economy as quickly as possible.Rather than focus on single arenas — like clean renewable energy, fossil fuel production and carbon taxes — he wants legislators to push a comprehensive plan that not only reduces carbon dioxide, but also cuts other dangerous greenhouse gases like methane.

Photo by REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo“That doesn’t mean we need to dismiss the contributions of coal and oil and natural gas, which powered America for 100-plus years. That’s a beautiful heritage,” Meyaard-Schaap said. “But the 21st century is the century of clean renewable energy. New technologies are calling us toward a different way of powering America.”Meyaard-Schaap has been disappointed by the rollback of the Clean Power Plan without a replacement because he feels like the Trump administration is ceding climate leadership. He also said deregulation on environmental protections for pollutants like mercury endangers Americans.Meyaard-Schaap’s organization wants to convince evangelicals — which represent a quarter of U.S. adults — and other christians that acting on climate change is a way to be obedient to Jesus in the 21st century.“The community that we’re focused on reaching takes the Bible very seriously,” Meyaard-Schaap said. “Scripture requires that we take climate change seriously because climate change is harming the world and harming our neighbors.”Common ground does exist. Pyle, a proponent of fossil fuels, recognizes there are issues with the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, but he argues correctly that many industries — not only energy — contribute to the problem. Cowin, too, emphasizes the need to decarbonize our industrial, construction and transportation sectors — though he says this can only be done through cleaner energy generation. “To get where we need to go, we need as many diverse people with as many diverse solutions as possible at the table,” Meyaard-Schaap said. “We think that regulation and free market solutions can work hand in hand.”",2,5,Pro,Pro,Pro,0,Pro,"['Pro', 'Pro', 'Pro']","Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?

Launched in 2001, Ceiba is the dominant foreign investor in Cuban real estate assets, managing a portfolio focused primarily on the tourism-related and commercial real estate sectors of the economy. Ceiba owns stakes in four hotels and several office buildings from Havana to Varadero that it plans to expand using the money it raised by going public.  Currently valued at nearly $180 million, the fund also plans to build a new 400-room hotel in Trinidad, a town in central Cuba that is growing in popularity as a tourist destination.These investments are coming at a much-needed time for Cuba given the economic implosion of Venezuela, their most important ally, from which Cuba has receive subsidized oil in exchange for medical and security services. Until recently, the second largest recipient of Cuban medical services was Brazil.  In mid-November, Cuba decided to withdraw approximately 8,500 healthcare professionals employed by Brazil’s Máis Médicos program after Brazilian president-elect Jair Bolsonaro accused Cuba of treating their doctors like slaves by keeping around 70% of their salaries and not allowing their families to travel with them.  The termination of the program will reportedly cost Cuba’s economy around $400-$500 million, which is more than the annual revenue they receive from sugar exports. To add to its woes, Cuba also imports nearly 80% of its food, among other things, and the country struggles to meet its debt obligations given its lack of access to hard currency or to credit as a result of the US embargo.  One attempt to put a band aid on this issue is Cuba’s dual currency system, whereby US citizens traveling to Cuba exchange their dollars for Cuban convertible pesos (CUC) at a 1:1 rate and pay a 10% tax plus 3% commission on top of that – but that’s neither here nor there.It’s no secret that Cuba’s state-owned economy is struggling, with economic growth in 2017 amounting to a meager 1.8% by government figures.  In November, the official economic growth forecast for 2018 was also lowered from 2% to just 1% for the year.  Add onto that the disappointing sugar harvests and weak exports that characterized 2018 and the problems just get worse for Cuba. But perhaps what we should be focusing on is Cuba’s proposed solution to remedy its economic woes: foreign investment. In its new Constitution that is set to be voted on this February 24th, the country upgrades it’s need for foreign investment from “secondary” to “important.”  In fact, soon after making an appearance at the United Nations in New York, Cuban President Miguel Díaz Canel went on his first international tour to the other side of the world, signing trade agreements and re-kindling bonds with current and former political allies like Russia, Vietnam, China, and North Korea – maybe he’s seen the writing on the wall regarding Venezuela.Ceiba’s IPO is indicative of the foreign investment interest in Cuba.  Another such indicator was Havana’s 36th International Trade Fair, which took place at the Mariel Special Development Zone just one week after Ceiba went public.  The fair is Cuba’s annual attempt to attract foreign countries, companies, and investors to do business there. Last year, proposed Cuban investment projects garnered a substantial amount of interest from abroad. However, one country whose presence at the trade fair was negligible, was the United States.  Given the political context at home, less than ten US businesses set up booths, a dismal turnout compared to the dozens that were present in 2015.While it’s true that the US and Cuba have made some joint progress in the fields of security, medicine, agriculture, and travel, US companies outside these industries just aren’t interested. Trump has tightened a few of the screws that Obama loosened regarding the US embargo on Cuba, a Cold War relic that still exists today. Many young Cubans, Cuban Americans, and Americans who are not of Cuban descent agree that the embargo has long outlived its purpose and that policies of isolation serve only to hurt both the Cuban and the US people. I also sit in this camp, but I have often said that the measures taken by Trump are largely nominal and it is the messaging behind the general policy shift from engagement back toward isolation that has people and businesses concerned.While Cuba tends to be polarizing and political in many aspects, lifting the embargo is one of the few areas in modern US identity politics where we are actually seeing some bipartisanship – who would’ve thought?  I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again that I am not a fan of the embargo because at this point all it does is serve largely as a mouthpiece and scapegoat for the Cuban government to blame their shortcomings on more so than anything else.Moreover, it has been proven that engagement between the US and Cuba benefits the Cuban people in a tangible way, with Cuban Airbnb hosts making over thirty times the average monthly salary of a Cuban state sector worker back when US-Cuba relations flourished.The numbers don’t lie, and this is just one example. Regardless, the point is that we must place an emphasis on being objective when assessing how a given policy impacts the group of people it affects (in this case the Cuban people) if helping that group is indeed the goal.That said, I can’t let the Cuban government off the hook that easily. Yes, the embargo is disastrous for the Cuban economy, but it seems that Cuba also institutes its own embargo against its people.You see, the Cuban government has estimated that it needs about $2 billion in foreign investment per year to sustain a healthy level of economic growth (with actual figures totaling dramatically less), but various organizations like the Havana Consulting Group estimate that almost $2.5 billion leaves the country every year with Cuban shoppers who travel to places like Guyana and Port-au-Prince in Haiti to purchase cheap goods for resale in Cuba. Let me break this down – The private sector in Cuba is very small, made up of close to 600,000 licenses for self-employed workers (some possess more than one).  Almost exactly one year ago, the Cuban government froze the issuance of private business licenses until they could come up with increased regulations for business owners.  These regulations came out in July and officially went into effect on December 7th, although there were some last-minute tweaks. Originally, the regulations would have limited business licenses to one per person and limited restaurant seating capacity to 50 chairs per restaurant, among other restrictions.  The last-minute adjustments did away with these limits, but the new regulations still harm Cuban entrepreneurs and hamper the growth of the private sector on the island.It doesn’t take a genius to see that the new business regulations are fundamentally aimed at preventing the accumulation of wealth and property by business owners. The Cuban government does not want private enterprises in Cuba, but it knows they are doomed without them.The government began allowing private businesses in 2010 after it laid off nearly half a million workers in an attempt to lean out bloated state payrolls. It was only after the private sector was created that the government began depending on its tax revenue to stay afloat. Cuba became caught in a paradoxical pickle, realizing it needed capitalism in order to maintain a socialist system. This is just one element that makes Cuba the backwards dystopia it is, where engineers drive taxis and people have greater access to free healthcare and education than they do to deodorant and toilet paper. This may sound like crude humor, but it’s the reality the Cuban people face. At the root of the problem is this: The state competes with the private sector. You may be asking yourself how the state can even stand a chance, and the answer is that they control the wholesale markets given the monopoly they have on imports and exports. The private sector is allowed to do business but is handicapped by not having access to raw materials. The result, as I alluded to earlier, is billions of dollars leaving the country with Cuban shoppers and entrepreneurs who buy raw materials abroad and bring them back to Cuba for re-sale.  Other countries, most recently Panama, have capitalized on this by making it very easy for Cubans to reallocate their dollars away from Cuba and into their markets.  For decades now, the Cuban government has overseen and to some extent sponsored the outflow of human and financial capital from the island abroad. Cuba invests in its people by investing in their education and their health. But I have always said, and will continue to say, that there is no point in being the most literate, skilled, and healthy population if your skills and education do not transfer to financial stability and your quality of life remains perpetually poor: The fruits of the Revolution are rotten. I have never met a Cuban or Cuban American who is not proud to call themselves Cuban, myself included. If Cuba demonstrated that it values the human capital it creates by allowing its people to invest in themselves and in their businesses on the island, few would ever leave, and the nation would flourish. If they made the projects for which they’re seeking foreign investment available to Cubans, maybe they could stop depending on foreign countries and companies for their livelihood. Cuba’s greatest asset is the Cuban people. Ingenuity and work ethic run in their blood.  They are not being valued by their government, and Cuba is bleeding as a result.*A Havana Times guest writer who will be contributing more articles in the future.Also read: Havana Is Not Your Hipster Playground by Chris Vazquez I agree. I’ve been saying this the first time I went to Cuba in 2005. Two currencies is ridiculous. I noticed then that the people are very well educated. However, after they complete their education they have no real means of earning a living because of the government’s strict policies of free enterprise. See South Vietnam for good examples of more free enterprise.Thanks for the reply Al. They do a good job of developing human capital, then watch it leave the country in search of a place where that capital is valued accordingly.Very much agree with you. They have it backward looking for foreign investors, when they are so many people in Cuba that are entrepreneurs. I wish Cuba could follow China example on this regard. The government is afraid or loosing control, and that cuban people with money will influence a change in politics. China demostreted there is not need for this fear. China gave their on people opportunity for business and now they are a world giant. Hope some of that mentality and results cold also happened in CubaYou say ‘that the measures taken by Trump are largely nominal and it is the messaging behind the general policy shift from engagement back toward isolation that has people and businesses concerned.’ However the fines against foreign banks trading with Cuba are real and extremely large: the French bank, Societe Generale – $1.3Billion: BNP Paribas – $8.9Billion: Credit Agricole – $0.8Billion: Barclays Bank $0.3Billion: Royal Bank of Scotland – $0.1Billion: HSBC – $1.9Billion: ING Group – $ 6Billion:the list goes on. The effect of American sanctions on Cuba is real and massive. It no exaggeration to say that NO other country on earth has ever experienced such a prolonged and massive economic embargo: do not belittle it. What is it about Cuba that makes American capitalism so frightened? America doesn’t care about humanity: just look at its foreign policy all around the globe. Cuban communism, without the embargo, would flourish and thus threaten the existence of the Beast itself.Hey John, a couple of points here. Firstly, you’re right to bring up the fines on banks and other businesses. Let me backtrack and clarify that the nominal nature of the reversal in policy was referring primarily to individual American travel to the island. The messaging and change in policy presents real risk to businesses wishing to invest or do business on the island, so we have seen a very real contraction in that area as a result (hence my description of the lack of American business presence at the International Trade Fair last year).Secondly, the line you quoted refers ONLY to the general policy shift from one of engagement under Obama back to isolation under Trump. This shift in policy and accompanying messaging does not refer to the economic embargo on Cuba, which has been in place since the 60’s – long before Obama. I completely agree with the devastating impact the embargo has had on the island and I do not belittle that impact in the slightest.Finally, and with all of the above said, Cuban communism would still cripple the spirit of the Cuban people and the economy of Cuba whether the embargo existed or not because it is an inherently flawed system of government that does not acknowledge market forces, human nature, or the way life works in general. The embargo, while devastating to the Cuban state, is a scapegoat for the Cuban government’s ineptitude.Sure, like Venezuela. This was sarcasm. The embargo has a cost to the Cuban Economy, but the cost is not 100% of the GDP. It costs 10% at most. Cuba does not produce much, and it is not a consequence of the embargo. It is a consequence of the whole corrupt system.Hey Neo, I’m not sure what your point is about Venezuela. But yes, the Cuban system is flawed and broken. And many Cubans have adopted the mentality that if something appears to be broken on the surface, it is that way intentionally. It is that way to “keep Cuba free and independent from foreign powers.” This contrasts the entire paradigm most people live by: If something is broken, you fix or replace it. Therefore, it would stand to reason that Cuba purposely propagates it’s circumstances.Awesome commentary and insight! I feel like I could have written this piece in the sense that everything I read is definitely among the things I have said and expressed over the recent past. I’m Cuban-Canadian and I’m very much interested in participating in the socio-economic development of the island. I applied for my re-patriation approval as soon as it became legally feasible and was approved. I bought real state in Havana and hope to help develop the financial intermediation industry on the island to help put all that human capital to its most effective use. I believe Cuba has immense potential for economic growth!The potential is there, overwhelmingly so. But the appetite to put that human capital to use is non-existent. The state does it just enough to siphon off the needed tax revenue. Cuba is extremely risky from an investment standpoint. Here’s why: People and businesses invest because they want to receive a return on their investment that exceeds their initial investment. The amount which the return should exceed the investment depends on how much risk is involved. Any risk assumed when investing in Cuba should be multiplied because your interests as an investor (return) are not aligned with the government’s interest (control). Given that the Cuban Communist Party is the supreme law of the land (which is about to be enshrined into law in the new Constitution), they have absolute control. The fact that they have absolute control and your interests are not aligned makes the risk not worth the return for many. That said, I too have thought about investing in Cuba and hope to do so one day. I would love to own a property and rent it out to travelers. I would have Cubans run the establishment and pay them fair wages, much like they would receive in the U.S. This is one of my profound dreams.Chris, good writing again, your articles will become top hits on this site. I can’t believe how ironic foreign investment is–help me connect the dots here. First, up until 1959, foreign control and ownership of property, assets and industries was rampant enough that Castro was able to sell the revolution, partly on the idea of driving out the dark forces of corruption and taking these things back, putting them back into the hands of Cuba and the Cuban people. And in itself, this was not such a bad idea to articulate, given some of the circumstances…From that revolutionary turn, a system arose that, combined with our blockade, has isolated Cuba and left the Cuban people so far behind the curve of life in so many ways, that a tropical island paradise barely grows any of its own food, and as you like to point out, doctors and engineers strive to drive taxis. Now, like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, the Cuban government awaits the inevitable dissolution of its failed venture, its untenable system…while deepening its voice and proclaiming its answer of the day: foreign investment…which will lead right back to foreign control and ownership of property, assets and industries. It is one big, slowly rolling hamster wheel…a perverse fever dream if not a flat out nightmare of governance. Two blessings within this brutal cycle: one is the buoyant and unbreakable nature of the Cuban people that everyone seems to recognize; the other is the inevitable surfacing of capitalism in a way that not only keeps the Cuban economy on some life support, but also keeps giving hope to the Cuban people, and shows them, and the world who visits and watches, that something else is near on the horizon. Let’s hope it’s something good for the Cuban people.Dan! Thanks again for the replies. Again, I agree with your analysis and you are right to question the current paradoxical reality. I agree the Revolution needed to happen. Cuba has always been owned by someone: Spain, the U.S., and now the CCP. The sad reality is that it’s not about finding the most opportune system to run a country or maintaining Cuban sovereignty from foreign powers or any of that propaganda. It comes down, at the root, to this: “How can we keep our heads above water economically and maintain power & control?” That’s the central question for the CCP. Because at the end of the day we know that market forces are necessary to maintain and grow an economy. It’s tried and true. But when it’s about maintaining control, I think the strategy seems to be to give the people enough to keep them complacent in a sense. Tourism itself since the Revolution only became a factor after the fall of the USSR, when Cuba needed cash to stay afloat. Now there is a renewed call for foreign investment. If they only opened the gates so the private sector on the island could develop and flourish, they could grow the economy.Cuba is one of the most beautiful destinations in the Caribbean. It is the largest and most diverse. It has an incredible potential. Currently, the tourist figure quadrupled to the previous decade.There are memories of Marti and Fidel in many places, when will there be a new leader that will lead the Cubans in a modern revolt against the present crisis. And yes a mean crisis, having visited Cuba 7 times during the past 5 years, I can not help but wonder why such an educated population does not rise up en mass and say enough is enough. One sees people sitting around all day with nothing to occupy them, they wait in line for almost everything due to the short supply of so many essentials. There is an increasing shortage of so many items including food. Many are forced to find less than normal ways to make ends meet. One has to carefully check every financial transaction to ensure the bill is correct and then that the change is correct. With so many professionals having been at work in foreign countries, there must be a common awareness of the shortcomings of the present system. Yes, medical care might be free or nearly free, but all medications are either expensive or almost nonexistent. This last visit, two weeks ago, was the most frustrating as I observed not only an significant increase in prices as well as many more items on various menus that were not available. The government kept publishing increasing tourist figures. This includes many tourists arriving on cruise ships. They spend very little time and money in Cuba. Talking with various casa particulaire owners, their number of guests are down. The outlook, as long as the aging old guard remains in solid control, is less than rosy.Hi Dave, I think there’s a multitude of reasons why the population doesn’t rise up. Remember that we’re now past the 60-year mark of the Revolution. There is the still lingering presence of the old guard, respect for the current authority, admiration for leaders past, culture, indoctrination in the school system, propaganda. There is an overall lack of context which is now just starting to shift, but people in the provinces have fractions of the exposure to the outside world that people in Havana have. No one has guns, people remember what was fought for, they believe their current system keeps Cuba free from American imperialism – there’s a TON to unpack here. I personally don’t see a new revolt or revolution happening in Cuba. Every time it came close (the last notable time being el Maleconazo) Castro opened the floodgates and released the political pressure that was brewing in the teapot that is Cuba. Throughout post-revolutionary history, Cuba encountered its turning points like Venezuela is facing now. But Cuba is no longer where Venezuela is. People sit and wait, wishing for a better future. But that revolutionary fervor to take matters into your own hands and create a better future – I just can’t feel it in Cuba when I’m there. Side note: I’m not too crazy about a country rallying behind one person or one person being the “leader” or the “savior,” whether that person is José Martí, Fidel Castro, or someone else. People need to understand they have the power to change their lives and their circumstances. They need to believe they own their destinies and then they need to be given room to run. That said, there is the cultural element of machismo and in Latin America it’s very common to rally around a strongman.This article makes some good points, but misses important ones as well. All island economies need foreign trade and foreign investments. Cuba is no different. And in today’s world that means dollars. One of the most adverse impacts of the blockade is the difficulties Cuba faces is changing tourist dollars for Euros and then spending them for imports. Estimates are that they loose 15% in purchasing power through bank fees for this conversion. Annual costs of the blockade are 3 billion dollars. Even an inefficient, bureaucratic government could do a lot with that money.Secondly, Cubans for the most part don’t buy “raw materials” abroad. They buy finished products that are manufactured elsewhere and resold at home. While this puts needed products on the shelves the money that leaves Cuba never return or circulates within its own economy.And lastly, but of critical importance, by importing 80% of its food, Cuba is contributing to its own economic crisis. When China began modernizing in the late 70’s despite having nearly 840 million people who were very poor, they were for the most part, food secure and thereby free from the need for foreign agricultural imports. Of course this has changed but food security enabled much of that change. Cuba needs to produce much more from its agricultural sector.Cuba has nowhere near the scale nor manufacturing base that China had when economic transformation began, so Cuba must decide whether to take a similar radical stance. Right now they are taking half steps and getting a corresponding limited impact on their economy.Finally, let’s be honest. Cuba could ‘reform’ politically, they could elect a liberal democratic president and increase the capitalization of its economy. But none of these measures will satisfy the US. America corporations wants to own Cuba’s greatest assets and wants full penetration of the entire Cuban economy by American banks and hedge funds. They in effect want to turn the Cuban clock back to 1940.One need only look around Latin America to see that this has been and remains the cornerstone of US policy in the region. The way forward may depend on changes in the US as much as from changes in Cuba.Great analysis. Quite objective and devoid of political intentionality. Many of the comments are also on point. I will be coming back, definitely. How damaging is the Embargo/Blockade to the Cuban economy compared to the policies established by it’s own government? I live in Cuba and I can say that the effects of the embargo/blockade are real and affect above all the quality of life of Cubans. It also affects citizens and companies from third countries. It has existed for many decades and we have “accustomed” to accept that it exists. But we must always remember that it is imposed by a third country in violation of international rights. It is like, close your eyes, imaging Trump announcing the US will do that to your country and maybe you will understand how wrong it is. I agree with Victor and his view on the international policy of the US towards Latin America. Totally. Now let’s talk about the Cuban government and its policies… I totally agree with Chris. I am also proud of being Cuban, in certain aspects of the international policy I agree with the position taken by my government, I am also happy to have good doctors to take care of my kids, but in terms of providing for the people the possibility of prospering and finding independently how to improve their quality of life… no sir. We need a change and we need it now. About the embargo/blockade there is nothing the Cuban government can do. Sad but true. So why not focusing in being creative? If you want different results, then approach the problem in a different way. Provide the means, give enough freedom and encourage entrepreneurship creating a business enabling environment. Use taxes to promote certain economic activities, not to discourage people from being successful and accumulate wealth. Who cares how you call it? What you need is a system that will not only allow people to survive, but also to develop and pursue its ambitions.Your email address will not be published.

However, after they complete their education they have no real means of earning a living because of the government’s strict policies of free enterprise. See South Vietnam for good examples of more free enterprise.Thanks for the reply Al. They do a good job of developing human capital, then watch it leave the country in search of a place where that capital is valued accordingly.Very much agree with you. They have it backward looking for foreign investors, when they are so many people in Cuba that are entrepreneurs. I wish Cuba could follow China example on this regard. The government is afraid or loosing control, and that cuban people with money will influence a change in politics. China demostreted there is not need for this fear. China gave their on people opportunity for business and now they are a world giant. Hope some of that mentality and results cold also happened in CubaYou say ‘that the measures taken by Trump are largely nominal and it is the messaging behind the general policy shift from engagement back toward isolation that has people and businesses concerned.’ However the fines against foreign banks trading with Cuba are real and extremely large: the French bank, Societe Generale – $1.3Billion: BNP Paribas – $8.9Billion: Credit Agricole – $0.8Billion: Barclays Bank $0.3Billion: Royal Bank of Scotland – $0.1Billion: HSBC – $1.9Billion: ING Group – $ 6Billion:the list goes on. The effect of American sanctions on Cuba is real and massive. It no exaggeration to say that NO other country on earth has ever experienced such a prolonged and massive economic embargo: do not belittle it. What is it about Cuba that makes American capitalism so frightened? America doesn’t care about humanity: just look at its foreign policy all around the globe. Cuban communism, without the embargo, would flourish and thus threaten the existence of the Beast itself.Hey John, a couple of points here. Firstly, you’re right to bring up the fines on banks and other businesses. Let me backtrack and clarify that the nominal nature of the reversal in policy was referring primarily to individual American travel to the island. The messaging and change in policy presents real risk to businesses wishing to invest or do business on the island, so we have seen a very real contraction in that area as a result (hence my description of the lack of American business presence at the International Trade Fair last year).Secondly, the line you quoted refers ONLY to the general policy shift from one of engagement under Obama back to isolation under Trump. This shift in policy and accompanying messaging does not refer to the economic embargo on Cuba, which has been in place since the 60’s – long before Obama. I completely agree with the devastating impact the embargo has had on the island and I do not belittle that impact in the slightest.Finally, and with all of the above said, Cuban communism would still cripple the spirit of the Cuban people and the economy of Cuba whether the embargo existed or not because it is an inherently flawed system of government that does not acknowledge market forces, human nature, or the way life works in general. The embargo, while devastating to the Cuban state, is a scapegoat for the Cuban government’s ineptitude.Sure, like Venezuela. This was sarcasm. The embargo has a cost to the Cuban Economy, but the cost is not 100% of the GDP. It costs 10% at most. Cuba does not produce much, and it is not a consequence of the embargo. It is a consequence of the whole corrupt system.Hey Neo, I’m not sure what your point is about Venezuela. But yes, the Cuban system is flawed and broken. And many Cubans have adopted the mentality that if something appears to be broken on the surface, it is that way intentionally. It is that way to “keep Cuba free and independent from foreign powers.” This contrasts the entire paradigm most people live by: If something is broken, you fix or replace it. Therefore, it would stand to reason that Cuba purposely propagates it’s circumstances.Awesome commentary and insight! I feel like I could have written this piece in the sense that everything I read is definitely among the things I have said and expressed over the recent past. I’m Cuban-Canadian and I’m very much interested in participating in the socio-economic development of the island. I applied for my re-patriation approval as soon as it became legally feasible and was approved. I bought real state in Havana and hope to help develop the financial intermediation industry on the island to help put all that human capital to its most effective use. I believe Cuba has immense potential for economic growth!The potential is there, overwhelmingly so. But the appetite to put that human capital to use is non-existent. The state does it just enough to siphon off the needed tax revenue. Cuba is extremely risky from an investment standpoint. Here’s why: People and businesses invest because they want to receive a return on their investment that exceeds their initial investment. The amount which the return should exceed the investment depends on how much risk is involved. Any risk assumed when investing in Cuba should be multiplied because your interests as an investor (return) are not aligned with the government’s interest (control). Given that the Cuban Communist Party is the supreme law of the land (which is about to be enshrined into law in the new Constitution), they have absolute control. The fact that they have absolute control and your interests are not aligned makes the risk not worth the return for many. That said, I too have thought about investing in Cuba and hope to do so one day. I would love to own a property and rent it out to travelers. I would have Cubans run the establishment and pay them fair wages, much like they would receive in the U.S. This is one of my profound dreams.Chris, good writing again, your articles will become top hits on this site. I can’t believe how ironic foreign investment is–help me connect the dots here. First, up until 1959, foreign control and ownership of property, assets and industries was rampant enough that Castro was able to sell the revolution, partly on the idea of driving out the dark forces of corruption and taking these things back, putting them back into the hands of Cuba and the Cuban people. And in itself, this was not such a bad idea to articulate, given some of the circumstances…From that revolutionary turn, a system arose that, combined with our blockade, has isolated Cuba and left the Cuban people so far behind the curve of life in so many ways, that a tropical island paradise barely grows any of its own food, and as you like to point out, doctors and engineers strive to drive taxis. Now, like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain, the Cuban government awaits the inevitable dissolution of its failed venture, its untenable system…while deepening its voice and proclaiming its answer of the day: foreign investment…which will lead right back to foreign control and ownership of property, assets and industries. It is one big, slowly rolling hamster wheel…a perverse fever dream if not a flat out nightmare of governance. Two blessings within this brutal cycle: one is the buoyant and unbreakable nature of the Cuban people that everyone seems to recognize; the other is the inevitable surfacing of capitalism in a way that not only keeps the Cuban economy on some life support, but also keeps giving hope to the Cuban people, and shows them, and the world who visits and watches, that something else is near on the horizon. Let’s hope it’s something good for the Cuban people.Dan! Thanks again for the replies. Again, I agree with your analysis and you are right to question the current paradoxical reality. I agree the Revolution needed to happen. Cuba has always been owned by someone: Spain, the U.S., and now the CCP. The sad reality is that it’s not about finding the most opportune system to run a country or maintaining Cuban sovereignty from foreign powers or any of that propaganda. It comes down, at the root, to this: “How can we keep our heads above water economically and maintain power & control?” That’s the central question for the CCP. Because at the end of the day we know that market forces are necessary to maintain and grow an economy. It’s tried and true. But when it’s about maintaining control, I think the strategy seems to be to give the people enough to keep them complacent in a sense. Tourism itself since the Revolution only became a factor after the fall of the USSR, when Cuba needed cash to stay afloat. Now there is a renewed call for foreign investment. If they only opened the gates so the private sector on the island could develop and flourish, they could grow the economy.Cuba is one of the most beautiful destinations in the Caribbean. It is the largest and most diverse. It has an incredible potential. Currently, the tourist figure quadrupled to the previous decade.There are memories of Marti and Fidel in many places, when will there be a new leader that will lead the Cubans in a modern revolt against the present crisis. And yes a mean crisis, having visited Cuba 7 times during the past 5 years, I can not help but wonder why such an educated population does not rise up en mass and say enough is enough. One sees people sitting around all day with nothing to occupy them, they wait in line for almost everything due to the short supply of so many essentials. There is an increasing shortage of so many items including food. Many are forced to find less than normal ways to make ends meet. One has to carefully check every financial transaction to ensure the bill is correct and then that the change is correct. With so many professionals having been at work in foreign countries, there must be a common awareness of the shortcomings of the present system. Yes, medical care might be free or nearly free, but all medications are either expensive or almost nonexistent. This last visit, two weeks ago, was the most frustrating as I observed not only an significant increase in prices as well as many more items on various menus that were not available. The government kept publishing increasing tourist figures. This includes many tourists arriving on cruise ships. They spend very little time and money in Cuba. Talking with various casa particulaire owners, their number of guests are down. The outlook, as long as the aging old guard remains in solid control, is less than rosy.Hi Dave, I think there’s a multitude of reasons why the population doesn’t rise up. Remember that we’re now past the 60-year mark of the Revolution. There is the still lingering presence of the old guard, respect for the current authority, admiration for leaders past, culture, indoctrination in the school system, propaganda. There is an overall lack of context which is now just starting to shift, but people in the provinces have fractions of the exposure to the outside world that people in Havana have. No one has guns, people remember what was fought for, they believe their current system keeps Cuba free from American imperialism – there’s a TON to unpack here. I personally don’t see a new revolt or revolution happening in Cuba. Every time it came close (the last notable time being el Maleconazo) Castro opened the floodgates and released the political pressure that was brewing in the teapot that is Cuba. Throughout post-revolutionary history, Cuba encountered its turning points like Venezuela is facing now. But Cuba is no longer where Venezuela is. People sit and wait, wishing for a better future. But that revolutionary fervor to take matters into your own hands and create a better future – I just can’t feel it in Cuba when I’m there. Side note: I’m not too crazy about a country rallying behind one person or one person being the “leader” or the “savior,” whether that person is José Martí, Fidel Castro, or someone else. People need to understand they have the power to change their lives and their circumstances. They need to believe they own their destinies and then they need to be given room to run. That said, there is the cultural element of machismo and in Latin America it’s very common to rally around a strongman.This article makes some good points, but misses important ones as well. All island economies need foreign trade and foreign investments. Cuba is no different. And in today’s world that means dollars. One of the most adverse impacts of the blockade is the difficulties Cuba faces is changing tourist dollars for Euros and then spending them for imports. Estimates are that they loose 15% in purchasing power through bank fees for this conversion. Annual costs of the blockade are 3 billion dollars. Even an inefficient, bureaucratic government could do a lot with that money.Secondly, Cubans for the most part don’t buy “raw materials” abroad. They buy finished products that are manufactured elsewhere and resold at home. While this puts needed products on the shelves the money that leaves Cuba never return or circulates within its own economy.And lastly, but of critical importance, by importing 80% of its food, Cuba is contributing to its own economic crisis. When China began modernizing in the late 70’s despite having nearly 840 million people who were very poor, they were for the most part, food secure and thereby free from the need for foreign agricultural imports. Of course this has changed but food security enabled much of that change. Cuba needs to produce much more from its agricultural sector.Cuba has nowhere near the scale nor manufacturing base that China had when economic transformation began, so Cuba must decide whether to take a similar radical stance. Right now they are taking half steps and getting a corresponding limited impact on their economy.Finally, let’s be honest. Cuba could ‘reform’ politically, they could elect a liberal democratic president and increase the capitalization of its economy. But none of these measures will satisfy the US. America corporations wants to own Cuba’s greatest assets and wants full penetration of the entire Cuban economy by American banks and hedge funds. They in effect want to turn the Cuban clock back to 1940.One need only look around Latin America to see that this has been and remains the cornerstone of US policy in the region. The way forward may depend on changes in the US as much as from changes in Cuba.Great analysis. Quite objective and devoid of political intentionality. Many of the comments are also on point. I will be coming back, definitely. How damaging is the Embargo/Blockade to the Cuban economy compared to the policies established by it’s own government? I live in Cuba and I can say that the effects of the embargo/blockade are real and affect above all the quality of life of Cubans. It also affects citizens and companies from third countries. It has existed for many decades and we have “accustomed” to accept that it exists. But we must always remember that it is imposed by a third country in violation of international rights. It is like, close your eyes, imaging Trump announcing the US will do that to your country and maybe you will understand how wrong it is. I agree with Victor and his view on the international policy of the US towards Latin America. Totally. Now let’s talk about the Cuban government and its policies… I totally agree with Chris. I am also proud of being Cuban, in certain aspects of the international policy I agree with the position taken by my government, I am also happy to have good doctors to take care of my kids, but in terms of providing for the people the possibility of prospering and finding independently how to improve their quality of life… no sir. We need a change and we need it now. About the embargo/blockade there is nothing the Cuban government can do. Sad but true. So why not focusing in being creative? If you want different results, then approach the problem in a different way. Provide the means, give enough freedom and encourage entrepreneurship creating a business enabling environment. Use taxes to promote certain economic activities, not to discourage people from being successful and accumulate wealth. Who cares how you call it? What you need is a system that will not only allow people to survive, but also to develop and pursue its ambitions.Your email address will not be published.

These molecules all activate a special protein called PPAR-delta and have the potential to treat fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetic nephrotoxicity, and to heal wounds.News of these findings was published today in Scientific Reports, a Nature journal, and was made possible thanks to a new, award-winning algorithm that Goldblum's team developed. This algorithm sifted through a database of 1.56 million molecules and picked out 27 with a strong therapeutic potential, as determined by biologists at the Novartis Genomic (GNF) Institute in San Diego.To date, these new molecules are undergoing pharmaceutical evaluations to treat two main health conditions. The first is Fatty Liver Disease, also known as NASH (Non-Alcoholic SteatoHeptatis). This disease currently has no cure and is a leading cause of liver cancer in the Western world. The second is obesity. PPAR-delta activation has the potential to increase physical endurance and trim waistlines by getting muscle cells to burn more fat. Future evaluations will hopefully include testing treatments for improved wound healing, and to prevent kidney toxicity in diabetics.Professor Goldblum is cautiously optimistic about these findings. ""With such a large group of highly active molecules, there is a high probability to find treatments for several common diseases. However, we should wait till all the experiments are done before we get our hopes up too high,"" he shared.To date, there is much pharmaceutical interest in Goldblum's new molecules.

2,Euthanasia & Assisted Suicide,Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?,1s2q6r,http://www.teenink.com/opinion/social_issues_civics/article/771899/Human-Euthanasia-and-Physician-Assisted-Suicide/,Human Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide | Teen Ink,"Please enter the email address that you use to login to TeenInk.com, and we'll email you instructions to reset your password. Often times death is considered the cruel truth which all people must come to accept and embrace at one time in their lives; if death was a better choice than the alternative, a much different approach and opinion would be taken by society. This is often the case for patients who have terminal illnesses which cause them unbearable pain each day. These patients wish for nothing more than to be able to painlessly end their own suffering through embracing death. For these patients, the offer of a painless death beckons much greater than the prospect of another day of continued agony and suffering. Human euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is the practice of painlessly administration of chemicals into a patient’s body which results in a controlled, painless death. Through physician-assisted suicide, patients who experience daily pain and suffering may die without any further delay or pain. Human euthanasia or physician- assisted suicide should be accepted as justice because not only does it follow the right of all people to die and avoid the pain and agony that is the alternative, but it is also a more financially responsible method to handle situations involving terminal illnesses. Human euthanasia should be accepted as justice because it honors the right of all people to die. All competent, terminally ill patients deserve the right to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. If the patient is suffering daily, and only wishes to die to avoid this suffering, it should be their decision as to if they would like to pursue the option of a painless death through a physician-assisted suicide. It should be the right of all people to not be forced to endure unneeded pain, especially when it is avoidable or solvable (Frey 13). In many cases, terminally ill patients are forced to endure excruciatingly painful existences due to either not being able to have physician-assisted suicide performed, or due to the stigma associated with it. Patients should be free to choose to undergo euthanasia in order to relieve themselves of agony and suffering that they feel each day due to a terminal illness (Frey 23). It is the ethical thing to allow human euthanasia due to the right to death being a right that all people have because it is unethical to force individuals to endure continued existence when it torments them with pain and suffering. No one should be forced to endure suffering that could be alleviated through physician-assisted suicide. Physician-assisted suicide is often the only method for helping these terminally ill patients experience relief from the pain they feel, and it is not the place of societyto regulate whether or not they should be able to attain this relief (Girsh 12). The idea of society keeping a terminally ill person from experiencing relief from their pain is terrible, as people should be free to make decisions free from the influence of others regarding their personal suffering and the absence thereof. Additionally, people who are tortured everyday by the pain they feel due to their diseases deserve to be happy. In order to feel happy, these patients should not feel the pain which they do every day; they should be free to exercise their right to death because it would help to stop the pain they feel. These people have been suffering for such a long time, and all they want is to end their pain (Kimsma 2). If physician-assisted suicide is accepted as justice then they could achieve the bliss and release that they had only imagined before. If physician-assisted suicide is branded as unjust and is no longer practiced, these people will be forced to endure as much pain as their disease mandates. They will live a painful existence, tormented by the pain they feel as well as by the desire to just end everything. These people will die slowly, very much in pain the whole time; they will die knowing that their delayed death and prolonged pain could have been prevented through physician-assisted suicide. Physician-assisted suicide should be accepted as justice not only because it honors the right of all people to die and avoid unnecessary suffering, but also because it is a more financially responsible method to handle terminal illnesses. Physician-assisted suicide is a more financially responsible method to deal with terminal illnesses than continued medical services and care. Terminally ill patients require a multitude of services and treatments, all of which are extensively expensive. While people are often shocked to believe that economics and finances would affect their life-and-death decisions, it is a fact that expensive end-of-life care often impacts the choice of physician-assisted suicide (Leeuwen 5). It is logical to believe that it is more financially responsible to opt for physician-assisted suicide due to the fact that physician-assisted suicide is often a cheaper and better solution than expensive, suffering-prolonging procedures for extending life. Modern medicine has evolved greatly in its ability to deliver life prolonging services to terminally ill patients. However, these procedures are often brutal, expensive, and painful. It logically makes sense for a cheaper, more effective solution to be favored over a more expensive, less effective one. Physician-assisted suicide offers a cheaper alternative to expensive life-prolonging treatment that will immediately end the suffering that the patient feels, while refusal of physician-assisted suicide provides the patient with an increased span of life, but at the cost of their own quality of life (Nitschke 14). For these reasons, physician-assisted suicide is logically a more reasonable practice for terminally ill patients. Secondly, it is unethical to force patients and their families to pay for continued life support and life-prolonging treatments and services simply because the only alternative, physician-assisted suicide, is illegal. Many families and patients are unable to cover expensive life support services that are required. It may be difficult for them to pay for these services due to health insurance not covering it, or they may simply e paying for all procedures out-of-pocket. They are essentially being forced to expend more money on life support services even if they are extending the patient’s life at the expense of their quality of life (Nitschke 16). Even if a patient and their family has come to the conclusion that they are unable to financially bear the weight of expensive continued medical services, if physician-assisted suicide is illegal, they will be forced to continue to pay them. Physician-assisted suicide offers a financially reasonable alternative to expensive medical services, which in many cases is desirable for families and patients. Additionally, in the case that an elderly terminally ill patient is being refused physician-assisted suicide and is having their medical services paid for by their children,mthey may wish to take the more financially reasonable route of physician-assisted suicide in order to lessen the financial burden which they are placing on their children (Nitschke 24). This gives rise to an ethical issue because the family is forced to pay for medical care that they have deemed to be unwanted as well as too expensive for them; essentially, if physician-assisted suicide is illegal and unjust, then society will be forcing families and patients into debt and financial instability simply because they are unable to accept the more reasonable option of physician- assisted suicide. While there are numerous arguments for the acceptance of human euthanasia as justice, there are still arguments against it. While there are several arguments against the institution of human euthanasia as just, one of the biggest arguments against euthanasia is that it’s irreversible. Critics of human euthanasia often argue that the effects of euthanasia are irreversible and that one cannot predict recoveries or breakthroughs in terminally ill patients. They also argue that patients may continue to live happy lives with their illness. They often believe that euthanasia should not be considered just because it removes any chance that the patient had to make a recovery, for a medical breakthrough to occur, or for a miracle to occur. However, these are all simply miracles, or figments of human imagination created by inability to comprehend truth. The chances of a miraculous recovery or breakthrough are astronomically low, such as they should not be considered a reasonable outcome (Vacco v. Quill 73). Additionally, in the countries where euthanasia is legal and practiced, euthanasia reduces life by often as little as a few hours. A Dutch case study found that in 86% of euthanasia cases, life was reduced by as little as an hour to a maximum of a week (Girsh 45). This means that euthanasia is a last resort for patients; it is an escape hatch used by patients in unbearable agony who would rather have their suffering ended now than in two days’ time. This supports the conclusion that in the cases in which euthanasia was used, the patient would have died shortly after, as well as that the chances of a miraculous recovery or medical breakthrough during this short period would be statistically impossible. In conclusion, physician-assisted suicide should be instituted as justice and legal because it observes the right of patients to death and avoid unnecessary pain, as well as because it provides a more financially responsibly method for dealing with terminally ill patients. Members of society should be implored to take a stance for the institution of physician-assisted suicide; think about keeping your own children in suffering unnecessarily while a clear solution is present. Not instituting physician-assisted suicide as justice and legal would essentially be you keeping those patients who are terminally ill in pain. Do not let those in pain due to terminal illness toll in suffering that could be prevented.This article has 0 comments.Copyright © 2019 Teen InkWhich of your works would you like to tell your friends about?

Human Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide | Teen Ink Please enter the email address that you use to login to TeenInk.com, and we'll email you instructions to reset your password. Often times death is considered the cruel truth which all people must come to accept and embrace at one time in their lives; if death was a better choice than the alternative, a much different approach and opinion would be taken by society. This is often the case for patients who have terminal illnesses which cause them unbearable pain each day. These patients wish for nothing more than to be able to painlessly end their own suffering through embracing death. For these patients, the offer of a painless death beckons much greater than the prospect of another day of continued agony and suffering. Human euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is the practice of painlessly administration of chemicals into a patient’s body which results in a controlled, painless death. Through physician-assisted suicide, patients who experience daily pain and suffering may die without any further delay or pain. Human euthanasia or physician- assisted suicide should be accepted as justice because not only does it follow the right of all people to die and avoid the pain and agony that is the alternative, but it is also a more financially responsible method to handle situations involving terminal illnesses. Human euthanasia should be accepted as justice because it honors the right of all people to die. All competent, terminally ill patients deserve the right to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. If the patient is suffering daily, and only wishes to die to avoid this suffering, it should be their decision as to if they would like to pursue the option of a painless death through a physician-assisted suicide. It should be the right of all people to not be forced to endure unneeded pain, especially when it is avoidable or solvable (Frey 13). In many cases, terminally ill patients are forced to endure excruciatingly painful existences due to either not being able to have physician-assisted suicide performed, or due to the stigma associated with it. Patients should be free to choose to undergo euthanasia in order to relieve themselves of agony and suffering that they feel each day due to a terminal illness (Frey 23). It is the ethical thing to allow human euthanasia due to the right to death being a right that all people have because it is unethical to force individuals to endure continued existence when it torments them with pain and suffering. No one should be forced to endure suffering that could be alleviated through physician-assisted suicide. Physician-assisted suicide is often the only method for helping these terminally ill patients experience relief from the pain they feel, and it is not the place of societyto regulate whether or not they should be able to attain this relief (Girsh 12). The idea of society keeping a terminally ill person from experiencing relief from their pain is terrible, as people should be free to make decisions free from the influence of others regarding their personal suffering and the absence thereof. Additionally, people who are tortured everyday by the pain they feel due to their diseases deserve to be happy. In order to feel happy, these patients should not feel the pain which they do every day; they should be free to exercise their right to death because it would help to stop the pain they feel. These people have been suffering for such a long time, and all they want is to end their pain (Kimsma 2). If physician-assisted suicide is accepted as justice then they could achieve the bliss and release that they had only imagined before. If physician-assisted suicide is branded as unjust and is no longer practiced, these people will be forced to endure as much pain as their disease mandates. They will live a painful existence, tormented by the pain they feel as well as by the desire to just end everything. These people will die slowly, very much in pain the whole time; they will die knowing that their delayed death and prolonged pain could have been prevented through physician-assisted suicide. Physician-assisted suicide should be accepted as justice not only because it honors the right of all people to die and avoid unnecessary suffering, but also because it is a more financially responsible method to handle terminal illnesses. Physician-assisted suicide is a more financially responsible method to deal with terminal illnesses than continued medical services and care. Terminally ill patients require a multitude of services and treatments, all of which are extensively expensive. While people are often shocked to believe that economics and finances would affect their life-and-death decisions, it is a fact that expensive end-of-life care often impacts the choice of physician-assisted suicide (Leeuwen 5). It is logical to believe that it is more financially responsible to opt for physician-assisted suicide due to the fact that physician-assisted suicide is often a cheaper and better solution than expensive, suffering-prolonging procedures for extending life. Modern medicine has evolved greatly in its ability to deliver life prolonging services to terminally ill patients. However, these procedures are often brutal, expensive, and painful. It logically makes sense for a cheaper, more effective solution to be favored over a more expensive, less effective one. Physician-assisted suicide offers a cheaper alternative to expensive life-prolonging treatment that will immediately end the suffering that the patient feels, while refusal of physician-assisted suicide provides the patient with an increased span of life, but at the cost of their own quality of life (Nitschke 14). For these reasons, physician-assisted suicide is logically a more reasonable practice for terminally ill patients. Secondly, it is unethical to force patients and their families to pay for continued life support and life-prolonging treatments and services simply because the only alternative, physician-assisted suicide, is illegal. Many families and patients are unable to cover expensive life support services that are required. It may be difficult for them to pay for these services due to health insurance not covering it, or they may simply e paying for all procedures out-of-pocket.

The new findings broaden the understanding of how genes can predispose certain individuals to obesity.The GIANT Consortium is a major international collaboration of more than 275 scientists that seeks to identify genetic sites that affect human body size and shape, including height and measures of obesity.Kari E. North, professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Gillings School of Global Public Health, is joint lead author of the new study, ""Protein-Coding Variants Implicate Novel Genes Related to Lipid Homeostasis 1 Contributing to Body Fat Distribution,"" published February 18 in Nature Genetics.Other co-authors from the UNC Gillings School include assistant professor Kristin Young, assistant professor Misa Graff, and postdoctoral fellow Heather Highland, all in the UNC Gillings School's department of epidemiology.Identifying the genetic variants associated with obesity is central to developing targeted interventions that can reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, to which obesity contributes in significant ways. Genome-wide association studies previously identified 49 loci, or positions along a chromosome where the related genetic variants are located, that predispose individuals to a higher waist-to-hip ratio, which is a way to assess body-fat distribution. Lower values of WHR are associated with lower incidence of these diseases.In this study, with a specific focus on coding variation, the team found 24 coding loci -- 15 common and nine rare -- along the chromosomes of individuals that predispose to higher WHR. Further analysis revealed pathways and gene sets that influenced not only metabolism but also the regulation of body fat tissue, bone growth and adiponectin, a hormone that controls glucose levels and breaks down fat.The team also performed functional studies across other organisms and identified two genes that were associated with a significant increase in triglyceride levels and body fat across species.""For the first time, we were able to examine, on a large scale, how low-frequency and rare variants influence body fat distribution,"" said Kari E. North. ""These variants are rarer in the population, but the effects they have on individuals are much larger, possibly making them more clinically relevant.""Another major finding from this study is the importance of lipid metabolism to bodyfat distribution, which could lead to a better understanding of how obesity causes downstream diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""A better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of body fat distribution may lead to better treatments for obesity and the cascade of downstream diseases obesity also impacts, for example type 2 diabetes and heart disease"" North said.Story Source:Materials provided by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

European nations have developed a funding mechanism to try to salvage trade and investment with the Islamic Republic but it's unclear if the protections it offers will reassure nervous investors.Conservative opponents have also opposed Mr. Rouhani's proposals to limit the economic footprint of sanctioned military entities such as the Revolutionary Guards Corps, a powerful military organization that controls a wide range of companies. The Iranian president says his bid to develop the private sector is backed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The ""worst economy"" is one dominated by semi-governmental institutions, Mr. Rouhani was quoted by ILNA as saying.

20,Banned Books,Should Parents or Other Adults Be Able to Ban Books from Schools and Libraries?,2s20q9r,https://carolinianuncg.com/2018/10/11/its-okay-to-be-uncomfortable-why-we-should-not-ban-books/,It’s Okay to be Uncomfortable: Why We Should Not Ban Books – THE CAROLINIAN,"Home › Opinions › It’s Okay to be Uncomfortable: Why We Should Not Ban Books Opinions EditorPC: San José Public LibrarySeptember 23-29 is annually recognized as “Banned Books Week.” It is a celebration that takes place all around the U.S., protesting the censorship of information in public libraries and schools. Since 1982, roughly 11,300 books have been challenged, according to the American Library Association. There are a lot of reasons why a book can be banned. One of the biggest is racial themes, seen in Sherman Alexie’s “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” and Harper Lee’s “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Most books that include racial slurs or unjust treatment of minorities, naturally, are protested. The use of them in an academic setting can often make students feel uncomfortable or offended. Witchcraft is another big one that gave J.K. Rowling’s “Harry Potter” series the ban hammer in several schools. Parents worry that the use of magic would promote their children to dip their feet into Wicca or Satanism. Novels with the mention of the occult or necromancy usually stir up religious concern.Whether it’s sex, violence, profanity or drugs, books are challenged all the time and that’s nothing new. In 399 B.C.E., Socrates was charged with corrupting the minds of youths. Hitler burned over 25,000 books in Munich for being “un-German.” Galileo agreed to destroy some of his manuscripts after pressure from the Catholic church. Think of all the texts which were lost with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. I think it’s important to remember that when a novel is banned now, it is removed from the classroom; it is not removed from the public. You can sleep soundly at night knowing Trump is not going to be taking away your copy of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ anytime soon. Therefore, the onus lies on parents, rather than the average Joe with no kids. I understand the difficulty in deciding what is and what is not appropriate for your child. After all, no one should ever be advocating for ‘Lolita’ to be taught to kindergarteners. ‘And Tango Makes Three’ by Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson is another story, literally. This book is specifically aimed towards a younger audience. It discusses same-sex relationships by illustrating the true story of two male penguins who fell in love and adopted their daughter, Tango, at New York’s Central Park. If that’s not the cutest sentence you’ve ever read, I don’t know what to tell you. There is concern that Roy, Silo and Tango are leading the gay agenda, and that scares a lot of people. That’s the bottom line of this whole process: books can be very influential and that’s scary. It makes parents only want their own opinions taught, but that’s not how the world works. At some point or another, little Suzy and little Johnny need to learn about racism and sex and gay people. That doesn’t mean that they’re going to experiment with it or even agree with these topics as they are presented. Some of this stuff is hard to read and I don’t mean ‘The Canterbury Tales’ kind of hard to read. I’m talking about the horrors of ‘Kite Runner’ and ‘Thirteen Reasons Why.’ The real problems human beings face are hard to swallow. Why should high schoolers be reading about them then? It’s important to be aware of all the bad stuff in the world because it’s going to be there when they graduate. Future adults don’t just have a right to this knowledge, their parents and educators have the obligation to prepare them.Banning books is just putting a bandaid on real problems. Is it uncomfortable how many times the N-word is used in ‘The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn?’ Yes, and by the way it’s 219 times in 366 pages. But it’s real life. People really spoke like that. It’s horrifying and students need to be aware how horrifying it was. Students need to remember the Holocaust and understand the treatment of minorities in both the past and present. Students need information. Who are we to deny them that?Sometimes being uncomfortable is a good thing. It means that we are recognizing an issue. To keep our heads down and be silent during injustice is unacceptable with the resources we have today. It is also unfair to forget the suffering of people of the past, because the subject seems vulgar. The world can be a cruel, unforgiving place, but banning books is not the answer.

First lady Gwen Walz took the stage in her first official action to provide support for the bill. In no uncertain terms, House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler, DFL-Golden Valley, said he was ready to get it done.“The Minnesota House of Representatives is going to pass ‘Restore the Vote’ this year,” Winkler said to applause from those gathered in the Capitol Rotunda.Under current law, those convicted of a felony lose the right to vote until after they’ve completed their sentence including prison time, probation, parole or conditional release.

The initial report had the suggestive vagueness of a battlefield dispatch – multiple combatants, as many as 30, embroiled in a “physical confrontation.”This sounded quite reasonable to most ears. People are, after all, bonkers. And it is hockey, which quickens the blood of all Canadians, right up to the point where otherwise average taxpayers are running out to their Volvos to fetch a tire iron. Of course, as it turned out, none of this had happened.“I have seen worse at a work site or a schoolyard,” one of the team’s parent reps later told The Globe and Mail’s Marty Klinkenberg.Read More: The brawl that never was: How an argument among parents at a hockey game went viral.A few sharps words had been exchanged, but no blows traded. Someone phoned 911 and in that broken telephone way, a foolish argument became Pickett’s Charge. The cops showed up in force and who can blame them? These were hockey people.There isn’t much fighting in NHL hockey any more. Most people agree that’s a good thing, in public at least.I will admit to a wistfulness for fighting and know many people who feel the same way. When they come clean on that, they do so in a lowered tone – “You know what? [check over both shoulders] I sort of miss fighting” – like they’ve just admitted to cheating at something.Then again, we’re not the ones getting punched in the head. So maybe we don’t get a say.But it seems that as the most obvious instance of violence is removed from the game, the low-grade moral panic around hockey continues to simmer. We worry constantly that hockey is “out of control” or that the mere playing of it encourages dark thoughts and actions.If someone were to tell you that a fight broke out at a swim meet, you’d think, “Did someone release a nerve toxin?” But when you hear the same story involving hockey, you assume the worst.

In the 1970s, this sort of thing happened daily in hockey. And we’re not just talking about the NHL.Were people just more savage back then? Yes. Even as kids, we were beating the tar out of each other at every opportunity and being congratulated for our enthusiasm. We used to fight at baseball.The on-ice riot between the Acadia University and St. Francis Xavier University men’s teams prompted a lot of pearl clutching. Fighting? Isn’t that over?(One Maritimer of my acquaintance sighed, “Tell them to spend a night out in Yarmouth watching a Junior A game. They’ll see some fights.”)Next came the public autopsy.As is so often the case, a spiteful word causes more injury than a blow. One of the players had been taunting another. The taunted player believed he was being targeted because he knows a sexual-assault survivor. The taunter said he believed he was just throwing out a generalized insult – “You look like a rapist.” The result was a big fight.It all ended in official handwringing, scripted apologies and multiple suspensions. The coaches got it the worse, which is the way this should work. If you’re being paid to be in charge, you take the blame. It was a proper shemozzle.Perhaps we can all agree on a few things.That when young people get together they usually share one trait – a heedlessness that will occasionally veer into epic acts of stupidity. That things will be said on the ice/field that would never be said in the real world. Though they oughtn’t, they are. That if someone said that to you, you might punch them, too. And that the fault here does not lie with hockey, but with the casual cruelty that competition, taken too far, can encourage.You are more likely to dam an ocean that rid sports of any of the above. No amount of penalty minutes or postfacto sanctions will work the trick.People will be idiots. Fights will result. In some instances, fisticuffs are an emotional purgative. While that shouldn’t be encouraged – and especially not at the amateur level – it also doesn’t mean the End of Days is upon us.And to complete this Rule of Threes, the NHL suffered this week through another of its bouts of philosophy. You know what the Department of Player Safety needs? It isn’t more former pros going through tape frame by frame. It’s an epistemologist: ‘Why is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness?’This one involved Pittsburgh star Evgeni Malkin attempting to axe-handle an opponent. Back in the day, Malkin was a little bit of a fighter, just like everybody else.A couple of weeks ago, he ‘fought’ Steven Stamkos. It looked like two guys simultaneously giving each other the Heimlich manoeuvre. As fighting has gone out of fashion, Malkin has forgotten how to do it.A meaningless scramble in the neutral zone turned nasty after Philadelphia’s Michael Raffl gave Malkin a rabbit punch in the back of the head. You ever get punched in the back of the head? It is deeply unpleasant. It is the least pleasant of the punchable areas on the body, none of which are all that pleasant.In the older, more barbarous NHL, Malkin might have fought Raffl. Or someone else might have later on his behalf. In the new, civilized NHL, Malkin instead attempted to separate Raffl’s skull from his spinal column with his stick blade.After a great deal of discussion and pondering, Malkin was suspended for one game and Raffl got off. Why? Who knows. None of this makes much sense any more.Would the presence and acceptance of fight culture have made that particular situation any better? Maybe. You could argue that it reduces stick work, and keeps the Raffls of the world from punching too many head-backs. But also maybe not. As noted above, people are bonkers.Eliminating fighting in hockey is not synonymous with eliminating violence. Until they get rid of all padding, start kicking the puck down the ice and have everyone play within earshot of their mothers, people will attempt to hurt each other. Use of fists is a single aspect of that. Eliminate one weapon and another will take its place.This is the one thing hockey has to distinguish itself from the world’s other popular team sports. Almost all of them involve putting an object in a goal of some sort. But none do it with quite so much animus as hockey.Though I may miss it sometimes, getting rid of fighting is an aggregate good. It had spiralled away from something spontaneous to a circus act. It had become bear-baiting and was diminishing everyone involved.But no tweaking of our social mores or the NHL rules can alter hockey’s essential character, which is roughness. Sometimes, that roughness will tip over into brutality.That isn’t something that’s socially contagious or can be corrected. It’s just something that is.Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community. This is a space where subscribers can engage with each other and Globe staff.

According to the US Census Bureau, in 2016 the 18-29 age demographic had the lowest voting rate at 46.1 percent, 12.6 percentage points behind that of the next closest age group. The idea of this amendment is that civic engagement becomes a habitual part of young people’s lives before they have too many distractions, according to political science professor Michael Latner. “Eighteen to 24 is a really important time for individuals going through adulthood. You’re moving out for the first time. You’re going through college. You’re starting your first full-time job,” Latner said. “It’s all about your individual resources and so people are thinking less civically, certainly compared to older adults who have more time on their hands, who pay more taxes, and who feel like they have a bigger stake in society.”This age group also has the highest change in voter population each year, according to 2016 US Census data. From 2012 to 2016, roughly 8,978,000 new voters became eligible to vote and a little more than half of that group was present at the polls. Supporters of a lowered voting age believe the possible new amendment can get young people into a culture of civic engagement early. Low’s intention is to get people voting regularly at a young age in the hopes that this will lead to habitual young voters who show up to the polls consistently. “There’s a magic number in voting cycles that says that if people vote three times in a row, they’re likely to become habitual voters for the rest of their lives,” Latner, who focuses on political participation and representation, said.Opposition to the proposed amendment asserts that it would just add to the democratic electorate in California. “Conventionally, younger people vote more democratic, so some might see this [amendment] as benefitting the Democratic party … But the data we have on young people tends to show that the younger they are the more likely they are to just copy their parents voting patterns,” Latner said. “So I don’t think you’re gonna be pulling a lot of folks into one party camp or another because their votes will probably just mirror their parents’ voting behavior.”California already implemented voter pre-registration, meaning that 16 and 17 year-olds can register to vote so that once they are 18, there are fewer obstacles to prohibit them from civic engagement. “If you’re registered to vote, it means you’re receiving voting materials from the secretary of state,” Latner said. “It’s about socializing young people into the routine of being a voter … so that when they’re legally able, they’re making informed decisions.” For that reason, it is not unlikely that this gets passed into law, according to Latner.

40,Drone Strikes Overseas,Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad?,1s40q7r,https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2019/02/17/us-withdrawal-from-and-russias-suspension-of-the-inf-treaty-the-implications-for-nigeria/,"US Withdrawal from, and Russia’s Suspension of, the INF Treaty: The Implications for Nigeria","INF is Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces. The INF Treaty is the short form for the “Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.” It was initially done on December 8, 1987 and entered into force on June 1, 1988. Following the policies of Glasnost (openness in the context of government transparency and increased freedom of expression) and Perestroika (restructuring) by party Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev and the eventual self-dismantlement and collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR), also simply referred to as Soviet Union, the bilateral character of the INF Treaty became multilateral with the accession of former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine in 1992. The agreement is one of many others done to maintain international peace and security, especially in Europe, but life is being taken out of the treaty with the mutual disregard for it by the signatories. The United States decided to withdraw its commitment to INF Treaty on February 1, 2019. In the same vein, Russia also suspended its own obligations resulting from the treaty the following day. Without doubt, the signing of the INF Treaty was largely informed by two sets of consideration. The first is a resultant of the principle of sanctity of agreements, requiring absolute compliance with obligations created by agreements voluntarily contracted. In this regard, Article VI of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is here relevant. Secondly, the US and the Soviet Union were mindful of the devastating consequences of any nuclear war for all mankind. This consideration necessarily required the quest to ensure strategic stability, as well as seek to prevent the risk of outbreak of war. Put differently, the need to ensure an environment that would be conducive to the strengthening of international peace and security, was a desideratum. From this perspective, the INF Treaty is important because of its objective and operational coverage. In terms of objective, the treaty seeks mutual protection and security, especially strategic stability in Europe. The treaty banned the deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe, meaning that both signatories guaranteed a nuclear missile-free European territory. In terms of coverage, it covers deployed and non-deployed ground-based short-range missiles with an extent of between 500 and 1000 km. It also covered deployed and non-deployed ground-based intermediate-range missiles with the capacity of between 1000 and 5,500 km. These missiles were not to be deployed and therefore were to be destroyed. And true enough, both the US and the former Soviet Union kept to the spirit and obligations of the treaty. In 1991, the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846 missiles while the United States destroyed 846 missiles. All inspection activities stopped in May 2001. With the destruction on both sides, it means that, before the destruction of the missiles, the Soviet Union was already more militarised than the United States in this area of ground-based short- and intermediate range missiles. The problem, however, began in 2014 when the United States accused Russia of non-compliance with the obligations of the treaty and Russia similarly began not only to explain its own side of the issue but also accused the United States of unfaithfulness to the same INF Treaty. President Vladimir Putin of Russia made it clear that Russia is not interested in any new arms race with the United States. However, Russia is being forced against its will to engage in an arms race with the United States. In this regard, President Putin declared: ‘naturally, we are not going to turn a blind eye to the deployment of American missiles, which present threat to our (Russia) security… We will have to take effective counter-measures.’ In fact, the Russian government made efforts to organise a briefing session for the diplomatic community in its capital on the fate of the Treaty and on the present situation on the banned short- and intermediate- range land-based missiles. The US diplomats ignored the briefing session and simply said it wanted to withdraw from the obligations of the Treaty. And true enough, the accusations and counter-accusations reached their crescendo on Friday, February 1, 2019 when the United States announced its intention to withdraw its commitment to the INF Treaty with effect from the following day, Saturday, February 2, 2019. The United States gave six months’ notice of complete withdrawal. On this same day, Russia reciprocally announced the suspension of the INF Treaty, meaning that there is no longer any control of nuclear missiles, with the exception of the 2010 New Start Treaty which still limits the deployment of strategic nuclear warheads to only 1,550 and which is also expected to expire in 2021. Will this treaty be renewed or not, especially in light of the deepening disagreement over the INF Treaty? In this regard, President Donald Trump not only gave Russia 180 days to quickly destroy its violating missiles and launchers in order to avoid new arms race, but also declared as follows: ‘we (United States) will move forward with developing our own military response options’ to Russia’s suspect missiles. This declaration could be explained and understood against US suspicions that, far back in 2013, Russia had already developed a new ground-launched cruise missile contrary to the obligations contracted within the framework of the INF Treaty. Without doubt, Russia had developed a new ground-launched cruise missile but denied any infraction on the basis of the obligations of the INF Treaty. Russia submitted that the range of its cruise missile was not up to what was prohibited. This argument cannot be waved aside simply because missiles that were prohibited, both shorter and intermediate, were between 500 and 5,500 km range. The implication is that any missile with a range outside what is banned may not be illegal. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said countries must be held accountable when they break the rules. Russia has jeopardised the United States’ security interests, and we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it.’ More interestingly, Donald Trump has it that his administration is ‘committed to effective arms control that advances United States, allied, and partner security, is verifiable and enforceable, and includes partners that fulfil their obligations.’ In the eyes of the United States, Russia is certainly one of the partners that do not fulfil their obligations. In the eyes of the Russians, the culprit is the United States. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Mr. Sergei Ryabkov, accused the United States of producing armed drones that were the equivalent of the prohibited land-launched cruise missiles. The Americans refuted the allegation and argued that they are surely not missiles, and therefore, the armed drones do not constitute an infringement of the INF Treaty. In his State of the Union address, Donald Trump said the United States had ‘followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the INF treaty.’ Russians argued that the United States have developed new missiles and do have the intention to deploy them in Europe. Such deployment ‘will be a crisis of security for the European countries.’ In this regard, Mr. Ryabkov, on Thursday, February 13, 2019, warned the Washingtonian authorities not to deploy any medium-range missiles near Russia’s borders in Eastern Europe. He underscored the possible consequences of deploying weapons in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as doing so would have violated the INF Treaty from which the United States had withdrawn. As the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister actually put it: I will make every possible effort to stop the United States from deploying missiles. I am sure that everyone who is somehow involved in our foreign policy, defense, and security activities will work as a team to prevent a situation that would mean everything that was a cornerstone of European security for decades has perished.’ The first import of this warning is that, if the United States is prevented from deploying any medium-range nuclear weapons near its own borders and the Russian shorter and intermediate-range cruise missiles can reach European territory, then the whole of Europe can expect to be frontally faced with nuclear weapon insecurity in the foreseeable future. What is also important to note about the foregoing is that both countries have truly not kept to the spirit of the treaty. They are both rearming. The accusations of one against the other, as well as the counter-allegations are nothing more than politics to which all African countries, especially Nigeria, should pay special attention for various reasons. First, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II), Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the various non-nuclearisation accords signed by many countries, are nothing more than fraudulent agreements consciously done by the powerful countries to give the impression to the whole world that they are much interested in the maintenance of international peace and security, but which is not always true. Whereas, the truth of the matter is that, when weapons, arms, their launchers, etc, become obsolete in the light of development of new ones, the major powers quickly come together and negotiate, as well as sign agreements that will only allow for the destruction of the irrelevant weapons but without stopping the development of new and more powerful weapons. And perhaps more unfortunately, developing countries are consciously denied the sovereign right to have access to the development of nuclear capability under the guise of their non-capacity and capability to manage the effects of possible nuclear explosion. The extent to which the powerful countries accept the non-nuclear powers to develop nuclear capability is limited only to peaceful uses, even though the processes of developing nuclear capability for purposes of war and peace are the same. Now that the fate of the INF Treaty has become uncertain, how is Africa going to be affected? Come 2020, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference is expected to take place. What is the position of African countries? How is Nigeria preparing for this under the new administration? Strategic scholars have pointed to the likelihood of the United States deploying the Precision strike Missile, which is said to be similar to the Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile with a range exceeding the previously announced 500 km. The development of another land-based cruise missile of the JASSM family that currently exists in air-launched versions has also been initiated. In this regard, what and where is the place of Nigeria and Africa? Why should some countries arrogate the right of development of nuclear weapons to the detriment of others? The possibility of a World War III is no longer ruled out. In the event of another World War, how will African countries align? Will African countries be free from nuclear attacks? What really is and should be the correct approach to the international politics of non-nuclearisation? Africa and Nuclear Non-proliferation Politics South Africa is probably the first country in Africa to have developed nuclear weapon with the assistance of the United States. The nuclear programme began in 1974 as an anti-Soviet project within the framework of the Cold War politics. It was for deterrence. In this regard, South Africa constructed six gun-type nuclear weapons. However, in less than ten years after the development, the Government of South Africa voluntarily abandoned the project and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapon State in 1991. The initiative coincided with the beginning of the post Cold War era which ended in December 1989. It is useful to note that the origins of the nuclear programme is traceable to 1948 when the South African government established the Atomic Energy Board, a precursor to the Atomic Energy Corporation, to develop the uranium mining and trade industry. In 1957, South Africa signed a 50-year nuclear collaboration agreement with the United States which enabled South Africa to acquire a nuclear reactor and the supply of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel. The nuclear reactor and 90% HEU fuel were delivered by an American company, Allis Chalmers Corporation, to South Africa and were located in Pelindaba, near Pretoria, in 1965. In 1967, South Africa succeeded in constructing its own reactor, called Safari-2, the first, being the US-assisted reactor. Both reactors were located in Pelindaba. As noted by the NTI.org, ‘in 1969 South Africa abandoned the critical assembly at Pelindaba and the heavy water reactor project because it was draining resources from the uranium enrichment programme initiated in 1967. Additionally, President F.W. de Klerk made it clear that between 1989 and 1994, his government developed ‘a limited nuclear deterrent capability’ as early as 1974. Today, the nuclear programme belongs to history but the knowledge of it does not. In other words, the abandonment of the nuclear project has not denied South Africa of its technological know-how and its use for other purposes, including peaceful uses, and eventually for belligerent purposes if there is a new Cold War. The situational reality of Russo-American relations, and especially in the context of the Venezuelan election saga, is a clear pointer to a new Cold War in the making. But what is the place of Nigeria in these international strategic calculations? The attitudinal disposition of Nigeria to the NPT is interesting: total elimination of nuclear weapons but which the nuclear weapons States are consciously opposed to, as clearly demonstrated in their clear quest for nuclear rearmament in spite of its prohibition by the INF Treaty. As explained by Nigeria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Offices and other International Organisations in Geneva, Ambassador Audu Kadiri, on August 30, 2018, for us in Nigeria, ‘the nuclear weapons option was never contemplated in the first place. Nigeria’s basic position has always been that, as long as nuclear weapons exist, they constitute a threat to international security and, indeed, all of humanity.’ More important, Ambassador Kadiri also had it that ‘for avoidance of doubt, the moral watershed in the clarion call for the non-proliferation and eventual elimination of the weapons of extreme terror, is the recognition that no one could claim to be safe and secure as long as there exists thousands of nuclear warheads, while others are making spirited efforts to acquire or produce more of these lethal arsenal.’ And perhaps most importantly, he explained that ‘Nigeria holds the view that the most effective and credible guarantee against the threat of the use of nuclear weapons lies in their complete and total elimination through a verifiable and irreversible programme of global disarmament.’ From the analysis of the positions of South Africa and Nigeria as case studies, both countries support nuclear non-proliferation treaty. In the specific case of Nigeria, the Government, does not only support the de-alerting initiative as a confidence building measure and as a pragmatic approach to disarmament but also prefers the outright elimination of all nuclear weapons. Most unfortunately, however, Nigeria’s position is the ideal, but international politics does not care much about what is ideal. International politics is the defence of the national interest through diplomacy by negotiation or diplomacy by gun boat. A country either struggles to qualify to join the Nuclear Weapons States or it accepts a dependentist and followership personality on them. There is no middle option between the two. Most unfortunately, Nigeria’s current position is that of followership and dependency which does not and cannot guarantee national security in the event of a new international conflagration. By virtue of Nigeria’s foreign policy towards Africa, by virtue of its economy being the biggest, its press being the most vibrant, and its people being the most populous, there is no good reason why Nigeria’s military should not be the best quantitatively and qualitatively speaking. Nigeria’s military should be the strongest in all ramifications. In terms of conventional weapons and nuclear arsenals, under no circumstance should Nigeria be lagging behind and be dependent. Acquisition of nuclear capability for peaceful uses is self-defeatist. What is ideal for Nigeria is also to acquire the development skills required for the management of nuclear disasters. If the possession of nuclear weapons can be good for some countries, it should also be good for Nigeria. There should not be any good reason to stop or impede Nigeria’s scientific development, more so that a new Cold War is in the making. Nigeria’s policy of non-alignment must be largely predicated on a nuclear-capability driven military. Nigeria should seek to be a Nuclear Weapon State. This is how Nigeria can earn international respect. True, the world will be hostile but that is what other countries have been doing and have also succeeded in imposing themselves. France and China did it the same way in 1963 and 1968. North Korea is another example. The cases of Pakistan and India are not different. If Russia and the United States are improving on their nuclear arsenals and have opted to set aside their INF Treaty, what good logic is there for Nigeria to be respecting an NPT that only relegates Nigeria to the secondary and dependent category of militarily weak countries? Nigeria should acquire both nuclear capacity and nuclear capability for both peace and war purposes and then, consistent with her policy of foreign policy of non-alignment, determine when to use it for peaceful purposes. This is necessary because the Nuclear Weapons States want to continue to wax stronger while seeking to strengthen the weaknesses and poverty of other sovereign States. Even if the principle of sovereign equality is more of an aberration in international practice, it is only when Nigeria can authoritatively assert and reassert herself in the comity of nations that her own claim of sovereign equality can be meaningful. Consequently, the politics of destroying old weapons and developing newer and more powerful nuclear missiles, and also preaching the sermon of nuclear non-proliferation to other countries like Nigeria, is height of international fraud to which Nigeria should not be allowed to subscribe.",1,7,Not-about,Not-about,Not-about,0,Not-about,"['Not-about', 'Not-about', 'Not-about']","Should the United States Continue Its Use of Drone Strikes Abroad? US Withdrawal from, and Russia’s Suspension of, the INF Treaty: The Implications for Nigeria INF is Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces. The INF Treaty is the short form for the “Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles.” It was initially done on December 8, 1987 and entered into force on June 1, 1988. Following the policies of Glasnost (openness in the context of government transparency and increased freedom of expression) and Perestroika (restructuring) by party Secretary, Mikhail Gorbachev and the eventual self-dismantlement and collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR), also simply referred to as Soviet Union, the bilateral character of the INF Treaty became multilateral with the accession of former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine in 1992. The agreement is one of many others done to maintain international peace and security, especially in Europe, but life is being taken out of the treaty with the mutual disregard for it by the signatories. The United States decided to withdraw its commitment to INF Treaty on February 1, 2019. In the same vein, Russia also suspended its own obligations resulting from the treaty the following day. Without doubt, the signing of the INF Treaty was largely informed by two sets of consideration. The first is a resultant of the principle of sanctity of agreements, requiring absolute compliance with obligations created by agreements voluntarily contracted. In this regard, Article VI of the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is here relevant. Secondly, the US and the Soviet Union were mindful of the devastating consequences of any nuclear war for all mankind. This consideration necessarily required the quest to ensure strategic stability, as well as seek to prevent the risk of outbreak of war. Put differently, the need to ensure an environment that would be conducive to the strengthening of international peace and security, was a desideratum. From this perspective, the INF Treaty is important because of its objective and operational coverage. In terms of objective, the treaty seeks mutual protection and security, especially strategic stability in Europe. The treaty banned the deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe, meaning that both signatories guaranteed a nuclear missile-free European territory. In terms of coverage, it covers deployed and non-deployed ground-based short-range missiles with an extent of between 500 and 1000 km. It also covered deployed and non-deployed ground-based intermediate-range missiles with the capacity of between 1000 and 5,500 km. These missiles were not to be deployed and therefore were to be destroyed. And true enough, both the US and the former Soviet Union kept to the spirit and obligations of the treaty. In 1991, the Soviet Union destroyed 1,846 missiles while the United States destroyed 846 missiles. All inspection activities stopped in May 2001. With the destruction on both sides, it means that, before the destruction of the missiles, the Soviet Union was already more militarised than the United States in this area of ground-based short- and intermediate range missiles. The problem, however, began in 2014 when the United States accused Russia of non-compliance with the obligations of the treaty and Russia similarly began not only to explain its own side of the issue but also accused the United States of unfaithfulness to the same INF Treaty. President Vladimir Putin of Russia made it clear that Russia is not interested in any new arms race with the United States. However, Russia is being forced against its will to engage in an arms race with the United States. In this regard, President Putin declared: ‘naturally, we are not going to turn a blind eye to the deployment of American missiles, which present threat to our (Russia) security… We will have to take effective counter-measures.’ In fact, the Russian government made efforts to organise a briefing session for the diplomatic community in its capital on the fate of the Treaty and on the present situation on the banned short- and intermediate- range land-based missiles. The US diplomats ignored the briefing session and simply said it wanted to withdraw from the obligations of the Treaty. And true enough, the accusations and counter-accusations reached their crescendo on Friday, February 1, 2019 when the United States announced its intention to withdraw its commitment to the INF Treaty with effect from the following day, Saturday, February 2, 2019. The United States gave six months’ notice of complete withdrawal. On this same day, Russia reciprocally announced the suspension of the INF Treaty, meaning that there is no longer any control of nuclear missiles, with the exception of the 2010 New Start Treaty which still limits the deployment of strategic nuclear warheads to only 1,550 and which is also expected to expire in 2021. Will this treaty be renewed or not, especially in light of the deepening disagreement over the INF Treaty? In this regard, President Donald Trump not only gave Russia 180 days to quickly destroy its violating missiles and launchers in order to avoid new arms race, but also declared as follows: ‘we (United States) will move forward with developing our own military response options’ to Russia’s suspect missiles. This declaration could be explained and understood against US suspicions that, far back in 2013, Russia had already developed a new ground-launched cruise missile contrary to the obligations contracted within the framework of the INF Treaty. Without doubt, Russia had developed a new ground-launched cruise missile but denied any infraction on the basis of the obligations of the INF Treaty. Russia submitted that the range of its cruise missile was not up to what was prohibited. This argument cannot be waved aside simply because missiles that were prohibited, both shorter and intermediate, were between 500 and 5,500 km range. The implication is that any missile with a range outside what is banned may not be illegal. US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said countries must be held accountable when they break the rules. Russia has jeopardised the United States’ security interests, and we can no longer be restricted by the treaty while Russia shamelessly violates it.’ More interestingly, Donald Trump has it that his administration is ‘committed to effective arms control that advances United States, allied, and partner security, is verifiable and enforceable, and includes partners that fulfil their obligations.’ In the eyes of the United States, Russia is certainly one of the partners that do not fulfil their obligations. In the eyes of the Russians, the culprit is the United States. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Mr. Sergei Ryabkov, accused the United States of producing armed drones that were the equivalent of the prohibited land-launched cruise missiles. The Americans refuted the allegation and argued that they are surely not missiles, and therefore, the armed drones do not constitute an infringement of the INF Treaty. In his State of the Union address, Donald Trump said the United States had ‘followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the INF treaty.’ Russians argued that the United States have developed new missiles and do have the intention to deploy them in Europe. Such deployment ‘will be a crisis of security for the European countries.’ In this regard, Mr. Ryabkov, on Thursday, February 13, 2019, warned the Washingtonian authorities not to deploy any medium-range missiles near Russia’s borders in Eastern Europe. He underscored the possible consequences of deploying weapons in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as doing so would have violated the INF Treaty from which the United States had withdrawn. As the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister actually put it: I will make every possible effort to stop the United States from deploying missiles. I am sure that everyone who is somehow involved in our foreign policy, defense, and security activities will work as a team to prevent a situation that would mean everything that was a cornerstone of European security for decades has perished.’ The first import of this warning is that, if the United States is prevented from deploying any medium-range nuclear weapons near its own borders and the Russian shorter and intermediate-range cruise missiles can reach European territory, then the whole of Europe can expect to be frontally faced with nuclear weapon insecurity in the foreseeable future. What is also important to note about the foregoing is that both countries have truly not kept to the spirit of the treaty. They are both rearming. The accusations of one against the other, as well as the counter-allegations are nothing more than politics to which all African countries, especially Nigeria, should pay special attention for various reasons. First, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I and II), Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as the various non-nuclearisation accords signed by many countries, are nothing more than fraudulent agreements consciously done by the powerful countries to give the impression to the whole world that they are much interested in the maintenance of international peace and security, but which is not always true. Whereas, the truth of the matter is that, when weapons, arms, their launchers, etc, become obsolete in the light of development of new ones, the major powers quickly come together and negotiate, as well as sign agreements that will only allow for the destruction of the irrelevant weapons but without stopping the development of new and more powerful weapons. And perhaps more unfortunately, developing countries are consciously denied the sovereign right to have access to the development of nuclear capability under the guise of their non-capacity and capability to manage the effects of possible nuclear explosion. The extent to which the powerful countries accept the non-nuclear powers to develop nuclear capability is limited only to peaceful uses, even though the processes of developing nuclear capability for purposes of war and peace are the same. Now that the fate of the INF Treaty has become uncertain, how is Africa going to be affected? Come 2020, the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty Review Conference is expected to take place. What is the position of African countries? How is Nigeria preparing for this under the new administration? Strategic scholars have pointed to the likelihood of the United States deploying the Precision strike Missile, which is said to be similar to the Russian Iskander-M ballistic missile with a range exceeding the previously announced 500 km. The development of another land-based cruise missile of the JASSM family that currently exists in air-launched versions has also been initiated. In this regard, what and where is the place of Nigeria and Africa? Why should some countries arrogate the right of development of nuclear weapons to the detriment of others? The possibility of a World War III is no longer ruled out. In the event of another World War, how will African countries align? Will African countries be free from nuclear attacks? What really is and should be the correct approach to the international politics of non-nuclearisation? Africa and Nuclear Non-proliferation Politics South Africa is probably the first country in Africa to have developed nuclear weapon with the assistance of the United States. The nuclear programme began in 1974 as an anti-Soviet project within the framework of the Cold War politics. It was for deterrence. In this regard, South Africa constructed six gun-type nuclear weapons. However, in less than ten years after the development, the Government of South Africa voluntarily abandoned the project and acceded to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapon State in 1991. The initiative coincided with the beginning of the post Cold War era which ended in December 1989. It is useful to note that the origins of the nuclear programme is traceable to 1948 when the South African government established the Atomic Energy Board, a precursor to the Atomic Energy Corporation, to develop the uranium mining and trade industry. In 1957, South Africa signed a 50-year nuclear collaboration agreement with the United States which enabled South Africa to acquire a nuclear reactor and the supply of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel. The nuclear reactor and 90% HEU fuel were delivered by an American company, Allis Chalmers Corporation, to South Africa and were located in Pelindaba, near Pretoria, in 1965. In 1967, South Africa succeeded in constructing its own reactor, called Safari-2, the first, being the US-assisted reactor. Both reactors were located in Pelindaba. As noted by the NTI.org, ‘in 1969 South Africa abandoned the critical assembly at Pelindaba and the heavy water reactor project because it was draining resources from the uranium enrichment programme initiated in 1967. Additionally, President F.W. de Klerk made it clear that between 1989 and 1994, his government developed ‘a limited nuclear deterrent capability’ as early as 1974. Today, the nuclear programme belongs to history but the knowledge of it does not. In other words, the abandonment of the nuclear project has not denied South Africa of its technological know-how and its use for other purposes, including peaceful uses, and eventually for belligerent purposes if there is a new Cold War. The situational reality of Russo-American relations, and especially in the context of the Venezuelan election saga, is a clear pointer to a new Cold War in the making. But what is the place of Nigeria in these international strategic calculations? The attitudinal disposition of Nigeria to the NPT is interesting: total elimination of nuclear weapons but which the nuclear weapons States are consciously opposed to, as clearly demonstrated in their clear quest for nuclear rearmament in spite of its prohibition by the INF Treaty. As explained by Nigeria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Offices and other International Organisations in Geneva, Ambassador Audu Kadiri, on August 30, 2018, for us in Nigeria, ‘the nuclear weapons option was never contemplated in the first place. Nigeria’s basic position has always been that, as long as nuclear weapons exist, they constitute a threat to international security and, indeed, all of humanity.’ More important, Ambassador Kadiri also had it that ‘for avoidance of doubt, the moral watershed in the clarion call for the non-proliferation and eventual elimination of the weapons of extreme terror, is the recognition that no one could claim to be safe and secure as long as there exists thousands of nuclear warheads, while others are making spirited efforts to acquire or produce more of these lethal arsenal.’ And perhaps most importantly, he explained that ‘Nigeria holds the view that the most effective and credible guarantee against the threat of the use of nuclear weapons lies in their complete and total elimination through a verifiable and irreversible programme of global disarmament.’ From the analysis of the positions of South Africa and Nigeria as case studies, both countries support nuclear non-proliferation treaty. In the specific case of Nigeria, the Government, does not only support the de-alerting initiative as a confidence building measure and as a pragmatic approach to disarmament but also prefers the outright elimination of all nuclear weapons. Most unfortunately, however, Nigeria’s position is the ideal, but international politics does not care much about what is ideal. International politics is the defence of the national interest through diplomacy by negotiation or diplomacy by gun boat. A country either struggles to qualify to join the Nuclear Weapons States or it accepts a dependentist and followership personality on them. There is no middle option between the two. Most unfortunately, Nigeria’s current position is that of followership and dependency which does not and cannot guarantee national security in the event of a new international conflagration. By virtue of Nigeria’s foreign policy towards Africa, by virtue of its economy being the biggest, its press being the most vibrant, and its people being the most populous, there is no good reason why Nigeria’s military should not be the best quantitatively and qualitatively speaking. Nigeria’s military should be the strongest in all ramifications. In terms of conventional weapons and nuclear arsenals, under no circumstance should Nigeria be lagging behind and be dependent. Acquisition of nuclear capability for peaceful uses is self-defeatist. What is ideal for Nigeria is also to acquire the development skills required for the management of nuclear disasters. If the possession of nuclear weapons can be good for some countries, it should also be good for Nigeria. There should not be any good reason to stop or impede Nigeria’s scientific development, more so that a new Cold War is in the making. Nigeria’s policy of non-alignment must be largely predicated on a nuclear-capability driven military. Nigeria should seek to be a Nuclear Weapon State. This is how Nigeria can earn international respect. True, the world will be hostile but that is what other countries have been doing and have also succeeded in imposing themselves. France and China did it the same way in 1963 and 1968. North Korea is another example. The cases of Pakistan and India are not different.

One bill passed by the legislators would add 13 new medical conditions that qualify for the program, including anxiety disorder, migraines and autism. The others are aimed at alleviating physician concerns over signing off on the federally illegal drug, allowing cancer patients to purchase and possess more dried cannabis leaves and permitting edible medical marijuana products. The House’s votes, which all exceeded the two-thirds threshold needed to amend a recent ballot measure, send the bills to the Senate for consideration. The closest bill to failing and drawing any sort of disagreement was the bill dealing with edible products that passed on a 72-21 vote. It would be added to other medical marijuana products that include dried flowers, concentrated oils, capsules, patches and topicals.Opponents were mostly concerned about the edible products falling into the hands of children.Rep. Chuck Damschen, R-Hampden, said he realized products might be helpful to some but he argued that the ""only real credible evidence"" is that a child or young person's mind into their early 20s can be damaged by marijuana use and that the Legislature shouldn't be misleading the public because marijuana is still a federally illegal drug.However, Rep. Gretchen Dobervich, D-Fargo, said the the packaging on edibles would be clearly marked, including letting people know that it can take two to four hours for effects to be felt because it was being digested.She also said like the other medical marijuana products or any medications they should be locked up or out of the reach of children or minors.""It would be irresponsible parenting if it wasn't,"" she said.Rep. Greg Westlind, R-Cando, agreed that there would be strict packaging and marketing and that such products as gummy bear edibles wouldn't be allowed. Rep. Thomas Beadle, R-Fargo, added that Captain Morgan rum might also have an appeal to children with its ""real cool pirate"" packing on its label, but said any packaging of edibles that would be marketed wouldn't have appeal to children.As for the bill on other conditions allowed, that passed by an 89-4 margin, those also added would be anorexia, bulimia, Tourette syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, neuropathy, opioid use disorder, opioid withdrawal and Rheumatoid arthritis.Rep. Matt Ruby, R-Minot, said all of the conditions were cross-referenced with conditions approved in other states. He said there might be some questions about opioid withdrawal but that it is thought to be another option for people trying to get off the painkiller medication.Ruby also noted that the bill calls for an interim study commission to look into possible new conditions that could be added.Another bill expanding the amount of medical marijuana patients with cancer could possess from 2.5 ounces to 6 ounces of dried leaves in a 30-day period because of chemotherapy and the drug's possibility of helping with nausea and vomiting passed by an 89-4 margin.And the other bill that will allow physician assistants to work with patients on medical marijuana and also protect doctors further in the program by saying they only have to say a person has one of the qualifying medical conditions instead of certifying medical marijuana usage sailed through on a 90-3 vote.The involvement of doctors in the program has been of concern as some patients were having trouble finding a physician that would agree to sign off on certification. Legislators said they hoped this new law would help ease that problem.Voters approved medical marijuana in 2016 by a wide margin, but lawmakers said the new law was flawed and needed changes.

18,School Vouchers,Are School Vouchers a Good Idea?,1s18q2r,https://helenair.com/opinion/letters/making-school-voluntary-is-not-the-answer/article_75541def-ad5f-5090-adc4-8c62e1047891.html,Making school voluntary is not the answer,"Bill 303 presented by Rep. Greg DeVries that wishes to make school voluntary and not mandatory has some very good points: Our schools are being used to indoctrinate children to believe there is no God, to think that there are no spiritual penalties for immoral behavior, and to promote liberal philosophies. Children are growing up without hope and our suicide rate demonstrates the results. Parents should have a say in what is being taught to their children. However, making school voluntary is not the answer. School became mandatory in the first place because children who were not in school were being used by unscrupulous adults. Gangs of children roamed the streets picking pockets. Child prostitution was out of control. Crime rates among children went through the roof in our cities. Requiring that children be in school kept the children from falling victim to criminals who would take advantage of them. It established order in cities. Colorado has put parents in charge of their children’s education by allowing charter schools and vouchers. The money follows the child. This means the parents can choose schools where their children learn certain skills, such as speaking a second language or learning computer technology, carpentry or mechanics in addition to the basics. Montessori schools, where children are taught with the multisensory method became an option. Home-school parents received waivers to pay for books and supplies. Christian schools were only part of the equation, but they, too received waiver funding. “We’ve never done it that way before,” are the words of a dying culture. Let’s not think that way! Montana does have a problem: Let’s fix it. Montana can only profit from putting its parents – instead of the state - in charge of education. Parents are in charge of charter schools. Schools become competitive and strive to become better. If parents don’t like what is being taught, they can take their child – and their money – elsewhere.

Making school voluntary is not the answer Bill 303 presented by Rep. Greg DeVries that wishes to make school voluntary and not mandatory has some very good points: Our schools are being used to indoctrinate children to believe there is no God, to think that there are no spiritual penalties for immoral behavior, and to promote liberal philosophies. Children are growing up without hope and our suicide rate demonstrates the results. Parents should have a say in what is being taught to their children. However, making school voluntary is not the answer. School became mandatory in the first place because children who were not in school were being used by unscrupulous adults. Gangs of children roamed the streets picking pockets. Child prostitution was out of control. Crime rates among children went through the roof in our cities. Requiring that children be in school kept the children from falling victim to criminals who would take advantage of them. It established order in cities. Colorado has put parents in charge of their children’s education by allowing charter schools and vouchers. The money follows the child. This means the parents can choose schools where their children learn certain skills, such as speaking a second language or learning computer technology, carpentry or mechanics in addition to the basics. Montessori schools, where children are taught with the multisensory method became an option. Home-school parents received waivers to pay for books and supplies. Christian schools were only part of the equation, but they, too received waiver funding. “We’ve never done it that way before,” are the words of a dying culture. Let’s not think that way! Montana does have a problem: Let’s fix it. Montana can only profit from putting its parents – instead of the state - in charge of education. Parents are in charge of charter schools. Schools become competitive and strive to become better. If parents don’t like what is being taught, they can take their child – and their money – elsewhere.

It opposes highway tolls, attacks on property rights and mandatory vaccinations of schoolchildren, according to its last publicly available 990 filing with the IRS.The newly created affiliate that commissioned the poll describes its own focus this way on its website: “Rhode Island Progressives are trying to legalize the killing of an unborn baby — for any reason — UP UNTIL BIRTH. We’re calling on every citizen with a sense of human compassion in the Ocean State to mobilize and show the Rhode Island legislature this is NOT an American value.“This morning, somewhere in Rhode Island a mother got to hold her baby for the first time. Under this new law, that same baby could have been legally killed just moments earlier. Let us not forget the barbaric procedure required to abort a baby so close to birth involves crushing the skull and dismembering the body. ...These are not exaggerations. These are facts. And they could soon be legal in Rhode Island.”“As God is our witness, we will FIGHT.”According to the sponsoring group, the telephone survey of 700 likely general election voters in Rhode Island was conducted by Cygnal between Feb. 6-9, 2019; interviews were conducted by live professional agents calling landlines and cellphones, and the demographics were “weighted to a general election voter universe.” The assigned margin of error: 3.7 percent.Cygnal’s clients include Republican Party organizations in a number of states, including the Associated Republicans of Texas, and “Trump Make America Great Again.”The survey probed, for example, support for “legislation allowing abortion until the moment of a live birth ... Legislation allowing a method of late-term abortion, also known as partial-birth abortion, in all situations.” More than two-thirds opposed both of these suggested legislative options.The survey did not ask about the status quo under Roe v. Wade, which essentially prohibits an abortion after a fetus has reached “viability” except to protect the life and health of the mother.But it asked which statements “best” reflect the person’s point of view, such as: “Abortion should be legal at any time during a pregnancy (21.7 percent) ... Abortion should not be permitted under any circumstances (12 percent) ... Abortion should be legal only in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother (12.8 percent) ... Only during the first three months of the pregnancy (24.7 percent) ... The first six months (7.9 percent)” Another question probed support for hypothetical “legislation that, except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger, bans abortion once the unborn is able to experience pain.” In this case, only 35.6 percent signaled support.The questions reflect the sharp divide between advocates and opponents over what the legislation introduced this year in Rhode Island actually does.At its most basic, the legislation bans the state from preventing a woman from terminating a pregnancy “prior to fetal viability,″ or “after fetal viability when necessary to preserve the health or life of that individual.” It also repeals laws that have been declared unconstitutional, including Rhode Island’s own “partial-birth abortion ban.” A federal partial-birth abortion law remains in place.Abortion opponents make this argument: without any specific language prohibiting third-trimester abortions, a woman could “abort″ a fully developed, unborn baby right up until the day of birth.Asked about the newly released poll, Barth Bracy, the lead lobbyist for the Rhode Island Right to Life Committee, told The Journal: “The top-line numbers do not surprise me at all, based on published results of multiple years of national polling. The pollsters appear to be credentialed and credible.” (Bracy had earlier denounced as “bogus” the finding by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, during a poll conducted last fall for The Journal, ABC6 and The Public’s Radio,that 7 out of every 10 Rhode Islanders favor keeping abortion legal in Rhode Island, regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court might do to the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling in the future.)But the Rhode Island Coalition for Reproductive Freedom said “the questions asked in this poll are biased and misleading, and did not ask about maintaining the status-quo afforded under Roe v. Wade.″“Currently, an abortion can only be performed after fetal viability in cases where the life or health of the pregnant person is in jeopardy,″ the coalition said. “The definition of fetal viability in the [pending legislation] is based on the language in Roe v. Wade and affirmed in subsequent cases.”Similarly, The Womxn Project said the “Citizens for Life” poll “used trumped up and misleading rhetoric and asked about a law that has already been settled at the federal level. This is in no way any kind of comment on the current legislation moving in the state of Rhode Island.”The Gaspee Project is the common link between the group that commissioned the new poll and the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity.“I founded both [organizations], but after the 2016 elections I stepped aside, and the Gaspee Board handed over management to Clay Johnson,” said R.I. Center for Freedom & Prosperity CEO Mike Stenhouse. “While completely separate corporations, both [organizations] are aligned in our missions to advance pro-business, pro-taxpayer, and constitutional ideals.

11,Prescription Drug Ads,Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?,1s11q3r,http://mentalfloss.com/article/557121/why-you-should-be-wary-prescription-drug-ads-tv,Why You Should Be Wary of Prescription Drug Ads on TV,"In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration permitted prescription drug companies to start publicizing their products directly to consumers in television advertisements. Compelled by the persuasive spots, patients petitioned their physicians for drugs to alleviate mood disorders, cardiovascular issues, and various other chronic conditions. But two studies released this year both came to a sobering conclusion about this direct-to-consumer approach: While advertising is persuasive by nature, drug spots may actually be misleading. In a report published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, researchers at Yale University looked at 97 drug ads that aired on television in 2015 and the first half of 2016. Most were targeted to people with arthritis, diabetes, and other ailments that require continuous care. None of them offered objective information about the potential risks of the drugs; the focus was instead on relative improvement in quality of life. In 13 percent of the ads, the drug companies suggested that various diabetes medications could be used off-label to reduce weight or lower blood pressure, a violation of FDA policy. The spots also emphasized positive results of clinical trials. These efficacy statements dominated the narrative, with statements like “most people using [the drug] saw 75 percent clearer skin,” or “my doctor said [the drug] helps my bones get stronger.” The Yale study concluded that these and similar claims were potentially misleading and difficult to analyze objectively. Another recent study published in the Annals of Family Medicine [PDF] examined the abundance of lifestyle depictions in the spots. Rather than dwell on risk factors, the 61 ads that researchers analyzed were predominantly made up of footage that made a direct connection between using the drug and an improved quality of life. Many of the ads were addressing conditions (like diabetes and depression) that might benefit from therapies other than medication. Roughly 59 percent of ads depicted a person losing control of their life as a result of their condition, while almost 69 percent suggested the advertised drugs enabled a more active and healthy lifestyle. The FDA is responsible for making sure companies don't mislead consumers, but critics charge that the agency is not doing its part. It doesn't review prescription drug ads in advance, nor does it restrict ad spending. “Everyone on the ads appears healthy, happy, dancing, and they get better,” internist Andy Lazris, M.D. told Health News Review. “So people are led to believe a) the drug will be effective (which is often not the case), and b) that they should replace their old therapy with the newer one because it’s better (again, which is often not the case)."" “And if they give you any numbers at all, they’re almost always the deceptive relative numbers that look really good, not the more realistic absolute numbers,"" Lazris added. ""So the benefits are over-exaggerated, the harms are downplayed or missed, and that’s how patients can get hurt.” Because the spots are so short—usually 30 to 60 seconds—it’s difficult to communicate the risk-to-benefit ratio clearly. Even when ads go into a laundry list of side effects, it can become white noise compared to the happy, smiling faces appearing onscreen. (Soon, the FDA might even allow companies to shorten that list, based on its own study that found fewer mentioned side effects allow consumers to retain more information about the drug’s risks.) The one part of the spots most critics agree is accurate? When they urge viewers to talk to their doctor.

Its authors maintain, “The blockade … against Cuba constitutes the principal obstacle to the development of all potentials of the Cuban economy.” Taking inflation into account, they say the blockade has drained $933.68 billion from Cuba’s economy since it took effect. Losses during the most recent year amounted to $4.3 billion.Once again the report appears ahead of a vote in the United Nations General Assembly on a Cuban resolution titled, “Necessity for putting an end to the economic, commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States against Cuba.” The vote this year takes place on October 31. Cuba’s first purpose in issuing the report is to inform national delegations at the Assembly about the blockade. In effect, the Cuban government is also sending a message to world opinion.Nations of the world have voted on this Cuban resolution every year since 1992, and every year they have overwhelmingly voted down the U.S. blockade. Only the United States and Israel have supported the blockade in recent years.The blockade is the centerpiece of U.S. aggression against a sovereign nation. The U.S. people on the side of decency and respect toward Cuba have reason to call their own government to account. The current report from Cuba is an incentive and a resource for information.Cuba’s 2018 report surveys U.S. laws authorizing the blockade, U.S. violations of international law, and U.S. and worldwide opposition to the blockade. The report offers a flood of examples of blockade-related damage showing up between April 2017 and March 2018. It surveys harm done to healthcare, education, sports, culture, economic development, foreign trade, and Cuba’s relations with international financial institutions.The report touches upon new U.S. regulations imposed by the Trump administration in November 2017, in particular the tightening of travel restrictions and banning of U.S. trade with 179 specified Cuban companies. This report returns to Cuba’s charge over the years that the blockade exerts an “extraterritorial” effect. It reaches beyond Cuba to affect countries throughout the world.The report outlines mechanisms by means of which the blockade causes shortages. There is the prohibition of direct dealings between entities of the two countries. The major exception is an allowance dating from 2000 for U.S. agricultural products to be exported to Cuba.Monetary losses also result from U.S. sanctions, or the fear of sanctions, that are applied to specific companies, agencies, and financial institutions in third countries. Their vulnerability stems from any affiliation they enjoy with U.S. counterparts or from any significant admixture of U.S. components or U.S. financing in the manufacture of goods in those third countries. Third–country companies involved in distributing such goods to Cuba also risk U.S. fines.Companies in third countries may not use dollars in transactions with Cuba. Banks are punished “for using the word Cuba in reference to the transaction.”The report catalogs difficult situations. Specialized medical equipment and drugs made only in the United States are unavailable and lives are lost. To buy goods from third countries rather than from the United States means higher prices and increased transportation costs. Cuban agricultural products are off limits to U.S. buyers. Services for Cuban embassies in foreign countries may be unavailable due to providers’ affiliations with U.S. companies. Tourist revenue is down as a result of the Trump administration’s new travel restrictions. The refusal of third-country banks to handle dollars heading for Cuba curtails revenue.Frustration results from a lack of access to equipment and services from abroad that are essential for improvements in the agricultural, educational, and healthcare sectors. Shortages in health care cause “pain that never can be quantified.” The near impossibility of Cubana Airlines to secure spare parts or to rent or buy replacement planes is a recipe for danger.Blockade regulations have long interfered with visits in both directions of performing artists, scientific delegations, academic groups, and cultural representatives. Academic exchanges and U.S. student programs in Cuba have been put on hold.Economic reverses suffered by Cubans at the hands of the blockade are thus quantifiable and serious. But, as the report demonstrates, the blockade also causes fatigue, discouragement, and dashed hopes affecting people’s daily lives. That, in fact, is the way it was supposed to be. According to a State Department memo in 1960, the blockade would inflict pain and suffering and thereby, in theory, provoke rebellion.The dominant U.S. media are ignoring the current Cuban report to the United Nations. One Internet search yielded two articles in English, one from Venezuela and the other from Cuba. A modified one identified another posting by the official “New China News Agency.” A search for Spanish language articles on the report produced an overflow.The blockade itself receives little mention in the U.S. press, which dwells on Cuba’s economic problems. Any pretense at objectivity surely would require press coverage of this U.S. policy, not least because the blockade has much to with shortages and economic stress in Cuba.We note, lastly, that the U.S. blockade operates in concert with other aggressive U.S. measures against Cuba, in particular, many well-established U.S. programs providing money and support for a political opposition there.

38,Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?,2s38q6r,https://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Encountering-Peace-Moving-forward-without-negotiations-for-now-579239,Encountering Peace: Moving forward without negotiations – for now - Opinion - Jerusalem Post,"The INSS correctly assesses that with the current leadership in Israel and Palestine there is no possibility of bridging the gaps between them at this time. This week, the Israel Institute of National Security Studies (INSS), headed by former Military Intelligence chief Maj.-Gen. (res.) Asher Yadlin, issued a new plan for confronting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The INSS plan is called “A Political-Security Framework for the Israeli-Palestinian Arena.” In its introduction they state: “Although Israel has never been stronger and more secure, it today faces a severe external national security threat in the form of a one-state reality, which would perforce be either non-Jewish or non-democratic. However, the Israeli political system of recent years has failed to address this threat seriously. “While the Israeli Right continues to lead Israel toward a one-state reality that threatens to destroy the Zionist dream of a Jewish democracy, the Left still believes that reaching peace is possible. However, the Palestinian parameters for agreement are clearly unacceptable to the vast majority of people in Israel, fall short of assuring sufficient security and demographic conditions, and fail to guarantee the end of the conflict. “Thus, both of the traditional two paradigms are unrealistic, and the dichotomy between them is artificial... The main advantages of the INSS plan... is in its very essence: defining a clear strategic goal for Israel as a Jewish, democratic, secure, and just state, and arresting the slide toward a one-state reality. The second advantage is in its modular, flexible, and phased implementation strategy. This strategy can breach the current impasse in the political process and enjoy critical flexibility of maneuver between various alternatives, while suiting the ever-changing strategic environment.” The INSS correctly assesses that with the current leadership in Israel and Palestine there is no possibility of bridging the gaps between them at this time on the fundamental core issues that must be agreed upon. There have not been any genuine Israeli-Palestinian political negotiations during the entire terms of the past two Netanyahu governments. There have also not been any Israeli political initiatives toward the Palestinians or initiatives aimed at setting a political border between Israel and Palestine. During all this time Israeli settlements, not only in the settlement blocks, have been expanding. Israeli infrastructure for Israelis throughout the West Bank (roads, water and electricity networks) have also grown enormously. Proposals for annexation of most of the West Bank (area C, which equals 62% of the area) have taken root inside of Israel’s Right wing and have trickled down to the mainstream. THE NON-JEWISH majority “between the river and the sea,” which is subject to Israeli control and domination, does not enjoy the benefits of Israel’s democracy, and thus Israel, under the continued right-wing Jewish religious population is destroying Israel’s own self-definition as the democratic nation-state of the Jewish people. The one-state reality is materializing before our eyes. It is already questionable if there remains a viable two-states solution. It is difficult to find Palestinians who still believe in that solution, which most thinking Palestinians now call a political fiction. The facts on the ground since the signing of the Oslo agreements, of continued Israeli settlement building, expanded land expropriations, house demolitions, removal of Palestinians from area C, entrenching the Israeli occupation and control over the Palestinians, prove to the Palestinians that Israel never had a real intention of allowing them to have a state of their own. Israelis who know the reality on the ground also have real difficulty imagining how a two-states solution could be feasible without the Palestinians agreeing to at least 10% of the West Bank being annexed to Israel, and east Jerusalem never being the capital of Palestine. Under the current reality, and in the absence of any clear Israeli peace initiative, there is no acceptable starting point for entering into negotiations. These were the issues that the INSS team of military and security experts placed on the table when they confronted Israel’s strategic options. The continuation of the status quo, which is not static but all the time moving toward annexation, essentially means that Israel either becomes non-democratic, apartheid-like, or it no longer can claim to be the nation-state of the Jewish people. If at the current time, with the current leaderships, there is no possibility of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, does it mean that Israel cannot take actions to improve the situation on the ground, create better conditions to facilitate possible genuine negotiations in the future, and to prevent the horrendous effects of annexation? The lessons from the strategic negative impacts of previous Israeli unilateralism, both in the withdrawal from Lebanon and from Gaza, have been learned. And so the question addressed is how to achieve a better result for Israel without handing territories over to the possibility of becoming areas for attacking Israel? The central element for mitigating the risks of Israeli withdrawal, according to the INSS, is to define a political border, which is not permanent; declare that the permanent border will be negotiated between the two states in the future; and to keep full Israeli military control of the Jordan Valley and freedom of military action within the entire area under Palestinian control for countering terrorism. THE OTHER central element of the mitigation of risks is to continue to coordinate security with the Palestinian security forces, even to enhance that coordination and to take steps for enlarging Palestinian territorial assets with contiguity, without Israeli settlements inhibiting free movement, and without Israeli checkpoints in and around Palestinian cities. These steps, according to the INSS plan, would increase the chances for a functioning governable Palestinian state in the future. The INSS also went beyond the regular separation paradigm of “Us here and them there,” recognizing that cross-border Israeli Palestinian cooperation in all fields – economic and others – would be mutually beneficial and could help to create the environment which would enable future negotiations. The INSS plan overcomes the Israeli habit of calling for divorce and hopefully recognizes that: 1) there was never a marriage, and 2) eventual peace is not built by walls and fences but rather by bridges of understanding and cooperation. The plan calls to “demonstrate Israel’s intention to promote political and territorial separation from the Palestinians and promote conditions for a two-state reality, thus improving Israel’s strategic position even without bilateral political progress.” While the plan does not undertake enough emphasis for rebuilding Israeli-Palestinian partnerships – something that an institute like INSS could play a very positive role in doing – this is the best option for Israel under a government led by the Right wing, yet cautious enough not to completely cave in to the demands of the Israeli settler’s movements. A more left-leaning government could do a lot more to create a more positive climate for genuine negotiations that would have to include dealing with Jerusalem, Gaza, refugees and a swap of territories with much broader cross-border cooperation in everything from water, energy and the environment to security. Renewing genuine negotiations, even with the current Fatah-led leadership, would not be impossible, but it would also demand Israeli initiative and demonstration of real intentions to create a viable two-states solution based on rebuilding partnerships of real cross-border cooperation. Giving a significant push to Palestinian economic development and seriously improving the lives of Palestinians on the ground by enabling more freedom is largely in Israel’s hands. New positive initiatives by serious people, like those in the INSS, are most welcome.",2,6,Pro,Against,Neutral,0,No majority,"['Pro', 'Against', 'Neutral']","Is a Two-State Solution (Israel and Palestine) an Acceptable Solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict?

The plan calls to “demonstrate Israel’s intention to promote political and territorial separation from the Palestinians and promote conditions for a two-state reality, thus improving Israel’s strategic position even without bilateral political progress.” While the plan does not undertake enough emphasis for rebuilding Israeli-Palestinian partnerships – something that an institute like INSS could play a very positive role in doing – this is the best option for Israel under a government led by the Right wing, yet cautious enough not to completely cave in to the demands of the Israeli settler’s movements. A more left-leaning government could do a lot more to create a more positive climate for genuine negotiations that would have to include dealing with Jerusalem, Gaza, refugees and a swap of territories with much broader cross-border cooperation in everything from water, energy and the environment to security. Renewing genuine negotiations, even with the current Fatah-led leadership, would not be impossible, but it would also demand Israeli initiative and demonstration of real intentions to create a viable two-states solution based on rebuilding partnerships of real cross-border cooperation. Giving a significant push to Palestinian economic development and seriously improving the lives of Palestinians on the ground by enabling more freedom is largely in Israel’s hands. New positive initiatives by serious people, like those in the INSS, are most welcome.",1265,1237

We've received your submission. News By Nikki SchwabContact The Author Submit June 4, 2018 | 7:17pm | Updated June 4, 2018 | 9:24pm WASHINGTON — Tipper Gore was more enraged about Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky than even Hillary Clinton, according to a new book.“Tipper Gore was furious at Bill Clinton, angrier than Hillary Clinton was,” author Kate Andersen Brower told The Post. Her new book, “First in Line: Presidents, Vice Presidents and the Pursuit of Power,” comes out Tuesday.With Lewinsky being the same age as the Gores’ eldest daughter, Karenna, Tipper “felt personally offended by the scandal,” said ex-Gore aide Jamal Simmons. The White House intern was 22 when the affair with Bill Clinton began.“In Gore’s case there’s no way he would have gotten to such a dark place if Tipper hasn’t been so mad,” another aide told the author.That “dark place” was Al Gore’s decision not to campaign with Bill Clinton during Gore’s 2000 run for the presidency, which – like Hillary Clinton – he lost because of the Electoral College math.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, used her husband’s White House record to vault into a US Senate seat in 2000, representing New York, becoming the first first lady to ever hold elected office.Today, Al Gore still bristles when asked about his relationship with Hillary Clinton – who many characterized as Bill Clinton’s co-president, diminishing Gore’s role as veep.“I expected him to say Hillary Clinton and I had a great working relationship,” Andersen Brower told The Post. Instead, “he thought the interview might have to be cut short,” she wrote in the book.In the run-up to the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton’s top aide, Huma Abedin, had warned campaign chairman John Podesta and aide Cheryl Mills that Gore had said in 2015 that he wouldn’t be giving Hillary Clinton his endorsement.Mills then offered that Gore might change his mind. “No. [It’s] bad,” Abedin replied in an email, which was part of the hacked conversations put online by Wikileaks.Eventually, the endorsement did come, but in the form of a July 2016 tweet. He also never showed up to that summer’s Democratic National Convention.Al Gore did, however, call Hillary Clinton after her 2016 election loss. ”She doesn’t need any advice from me,” he said to the author. “It was commiserating and reaching out to say, in her husband’s famous phrase, ‘I feel your pain.’”Ron Klain, who served as both Al Gore and Joe Biden’s chief of staff, described the call to Andersen Brower as “nice” and “courteous,” but added, “I don’t think there’s been deep bonding.”“They are both in that strange club of having won the popular vote and lost the Electoral College,” Andersen Brower pointed out.They also were both negatively affected politically by Bill Clinton’s extracurricular sex life. President Trump turned the Democratic ex-president’s misdeeds into political fodder after he was exposed for saying that as a celebrity he could grab women “by the p—y.” Trump suggested that Hillary Clinton was complicit.“They both suffered because of him,” Andersen Brower said, pointing to Hillary Clinton and Al Gore’s relationship with Bill Clinton.Bill Clinton was in the news again Monday, revealing on the “Today” show that he never apologized personally to Lewinsky. “I apologized to everyone in the world.”The book reveals that after denying the affair with Lewinsky to Al Gore in the entryway of the Oval Office, Bill Clinton eventually came clean to his vice president in the backseat of a limousine on Aug. 10, 1998, a week before the American public knew.Bill Clinton told Al Gore that he was disappointed in himself. “Well, this is the first time you have apologized to me personally,” Al Gore answered.After the confession, however, Bill Clinton was in a good mood, while Al Gore turned sour.He was “upset, offended, and conflicted about what it all would mean for his own presidential ambitions,” Andersen Brower wrote.Al and Tipper Gore, the author suggested, never recovered from his 2000 election loss.The Gores separated in 2010.

She also explained that in more affluent school districts, the standardized tests are not so heavily relied upon and are looked at more of as “a kind of annoyance.”“But for our kids in our most vulnerable situations, they have obsessed over these tests so that they have narrowed what it means to teach and what it means to learn.”Watch NewsOne Now guest host Mo Ivory and Garcia discuss how No Child Left Behind and standardized testing has adversely impacted education, especially in underserved communities.Be sure to watch “NewsOne Now” with Roland Martin, weekdays at 9 a.m. EST on TV One.Subscribe to the “NewsOne Now” Audio Podcast on iTunes.Corey Feldman, Former Childhood Friend Of Michael Jackson, Slams…R Kelly’s Net Worth Has Plummeted, But He’s Still Getting…Lynne Patton, Who Once Called April Ryan Miss Piggy, Further Debased…Valenica Love’s Jobs Are Under Attack After She Bailed Out…Someone Stole From Aretha Franklin Months Before She Died And Cops…Kanye West’s Contract Shows He Chose SlaveryR.

33,Ronald Reagan,Was Ronald Reagan a Good President?,2s33q4r,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900055626/why-the-principles-lessons-from-ronald-reagan-are-what-the-future-needs-podcast.html,"Why the principles, lessons from Ronald Reagan are what the future needs (+podcast)  | Deseret News","Editor’s note: The following is a transcript of the episode. It's been edited for clarity.Boyd Matheson: Leadership is lacking in Washington and across the nation. Young people are drifting from the principles and values that have shaped America from its founding. Legacies born of big ideas, civil debate and open dialogue and American optimism seem to be fading from the public square and the collective memory of the country. Ronald Reagan was the happy warrior and the great communicator. He was a president who challenged citizens to believe in themselves as well as their neighbors.Andrew Coffin, director of the Reagan Ranch and vice president of Young America's Foundation joins us to discuss the return of Reaganesque leadership, preservation of a legacy, and instilling principles in the rising generation on this episode of Therefore, What?All right, we are very pleased to be joined today by Andrew Coffin from the Reagan Ranch and Young America's Foundation. Andrew, thanks for joining us today.Andrew Coffin: Boyd, thank you so much for having me. Great to be with you.BM: Well, you have one of the great jobs in America, I always say, really preserving and protecting the Reagan legacy and particularly the Reagan Ranch. A lot of people think, when they think about Ronald Reagan or a place to go to, they often think of the Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, which of course has its place. But you're tasked with something that I think is really the heart and soul of who Ronald Reagan was. So tell our listeners a little bit about the Reagan Ranch and how it came to be and what its mission really is.AC: Boyd, the frequency with which people tell me I've got one of the best jobs in the world is a reminder that I need to keep looking over my shoulder. It's a job I want to hang on to. But it's true, it is one of the best jobs in the world and so much of that is wrapped up in this special place, Rancho del Cielo, Ronald Reagan's Western White House and the Reagans' home for 25 years.You're correct — it's not the Presidential Library. Our Presidential library system is an important repository of official documents and an important research institution. But I think one way to understand the difference is the way former Attorney General Ed Meese put it. He said you go to the library to learn about the presidency, you come to the ranch to meet the man. And I think that sums it up well. Today Ronald Reagan's ranch home in the mountains northwest of Santa Barbara sits almost exactly as it did when he so enjoyed it. You walk in the front door and his books are on the bookshelves, His clothes are in the closet, his saddles and chain saws are up in the tack barn. It really feels as though he never left and I think there's just something remarkably intimate, something very personal about walking in someone's footsteps, seeing the sorts of books they kept on the bookshelves, how they surrounded themselves in their most private moments, learning what they do with their free time. And visit to the ranch, as someone once said, is a window into Ronald Reagan's soul. It really tells you a lot about his character, his values.While most children’s excitement is bursting by the end of the school year, summer break can be a source of stress for...BM: Yeah, it really does. I've always said you can learn a lot about Ronald Reagan in books and other places. But until you've been to the ranch you really don't understand the man. The person and the place are so interwoven and so many critical lessons there. Give us just a brief peek, Andrew, into, you know, as things ended, as President Reagan wound down and as the family was looking at what to do with the ranch. Give us just a quick snapshot there. And then I want to get into some of the lessons from the ranch.AC: Sure. Many of your listeners probably remember that 1994 letter that Ronald Reagan wrote to the American people, that handwritten letter announcing that he had Alzheimer's disease. A powerful statement in its own right, you know. We quickly forget that people were much more hesitant to talk about Alzheimer's even back in the early '90s compared to the way we are today. And at that stage, in 1994, Ronald Reagan was still going to the ranch regularly. But the visits were becoming increasingly difficult. And they reached a point where it became clear he was not going to be able to continue enjoying the ranch. And they made the difficult decision to put the property up for sale. There were attempts at the state and federal level, and I won't go into all of that history, but it's important to understand that the ranch truly was in danger of being lost. The preservation efforts at the state and federal level failed, there were some interested parties who wanted to build homesites up there, a fair amount of national attention on this saga. And Ron Robinson, the president of Young America's Foundation, and our board of directors, decided to move quickly, that somebody had to act to ensure that this presidential site — and really I can't think of a more important site for conservatives in the country — was protected and preserved. So we were able to acquire the ranch directly from the Reagan family.April of 1998 was when the sale went through. And since that day, we've been using the ranch not only as a place to preserve history, as a place to tell stories about Ronald Reagan and the Reagan years, but as a place to introduce, particularly young people, high school and college students, to his values, his principles, his ideals.BM: That's such an important part of what happens there at the ranch. I remember the very first time I went and we started at the Reagan Ranch Center there in Santa Barbara, down in the valley. And I was so struck — you know, when most people think about the Reagan years, those that can remember them usually say everyone loved Ronald Reagan. The democrats loved Ronald Reagan, the Republicans loved Ronald Reagan, the media loved Ronald Reagan, and I was really struck that first time I went there that the very first thing that you show people as they come into the center is about a 4 1/2-minute video of every major political and media pundit that was alive at the time just ripping Ronald Reagan to shreds. I mean, from George H.W. Bush saying it was ""Voodoo economics,"" to all of the nighttime folks, you know, saying he was radical and dangerous and a threat to world peace. Tell me why you started with that. It's just such a great lesson.AC: We were really pleased with the way that exhibit turned out. It's called the Reagan critics. And you're right. It's a 4- or 5-minute film recounting some of the most vicious attacks on the president from left, right, middle, you name it and I have to tell you, when we when we first installed that exhibit I'm afraid some of our wonderful volunteer docents, who clearly love and admire and respect Ronald Reagan, that's the reason they give so much of their time to the center, they were shocked and horrified that we put in such an exhibit.But as you're suggesting, I think that is such a critical, important part of the story to tell for a couple of reasons. We do quickly forget, we have this image of Ronald Reagan today as a kindly, grandfatherly figure. And certainly that was part of his appeal. He made Americans feel good about themselves, the way a grandfather might. But it is of critical importance that we remember what he was up against, and how firmly he stood on the principles in which he believed, that he had spent decades developing, refining before he ran for the presidency in 1980. And so we think to truly appreciate his courage, his boldness, his fortitude, you have to understand what he was up against, the way he was attacked. There are also, as I'm sure you would relate to, there are eerie echoes of some of the rhetoric we hear today. And I think that is also a good lesson. As young people hear conservative leaders today viciously attacked and these horror stories about what's going to happen if conservative principles are turned into policy. We need to remember that Ronald Reagan faced the same thing and faced down the same critics.BM: I'm so glad you mentioned that, Andrew, because it is so easy to get caught in the later years of the Reagan presidency, where he was such a beloved figure, to realize that he did have to really stand up and speak out even against his own party, even against people who he thought were his friends. But to be able to do that, and then to achieve all of the things that he achieved, I think just speaks volumes there.I want to shift a little bit now, Andrew, and kind of visually take people up to the ranch. This is not an easy place to get to. So it really is a ranch in the sky, as the name suggests. Tell us about some of the people who've visited there and give us an insight into why you think Reagan was so drawn to that space.AC: Sure. Well, you mentioned the Reagan Ranch Center earlier. And I'm glad you brought that up because that is our schoolhouse for Reaganism in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara, just two blocks from the waterfront, easily accessible and also includes free exhibit galleries. And so that is a place that I encourage anyone interested in the ranch and the mission and work of Young America's Foundation to visit if you're anywhere near the Santa Barbara area.You're correct that the ranch itself is far more remote. It's tucked up on a peak in the San Ynez mountains, you take a winding, 7-mile mountain road to reach the entrance to the property. Certainly the sort of road that put off Mrs. Reagan the first time they visited the ranch when they were considering buying the place, but he instantly fell in love with it. And it became his retreat. There are so many ways you know, and we've been able to understand just how important this place was to Ronald Reagan. One indication is the amount of work he put into it. When he was at the ranch he wanted to get away from the Washington, D.C., lifestyle. He wanted to not only ride his beloved horses in the mornings, but spend the rest of the day clearing brush, chopping wood for the fireplaces, building telephone pole fencing, laying the stone patio in front of the home, retiled the roof himself, everything about the ranch reflects the President's own hand and what he invested in the property. You also know the significance of the ranch, as you suggested, by who he invited there. This was not a place they did a lot of entertaining, it really was a place they guarded closely. They wanted a retreat for the two of them to enjoy each other, where the President could think, reflect, pray, go back to Washington recharged. But they did invite Mikhail Gorbachev, George and Barbara Bush, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Margaret Thatcher, Brian Mulroney, the Prime Minister of Canada, to visit them there at the ranch. And I think Ronald Reagan, that there was something about him and his connection to that property that he thought they would better understand if they visited him at the ranch.Certainly, it was an eye-opening experience for somebody like Mikhail Gorbachev, who, though he espoused the principles of communism, lived as other as every other Soviet leader did with access to the retreats, the doctors and the Black Sea that were only available to the Soviet elite, which is not the sort of way that he was accustomed to meeting with an important world leader. But that was who Ronald Reagan was. And, of course, he often talks about the ranch. So many of the great letters that have been published, and speeches and addresses, his final words to the American people. His farewell address from the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan talks about the bittersweet prospect of leaving Washington, D.C., and the White House behind, but the joy of returning to California, the ranch and freedom. Those were two concepts that were always linked in his mind. I think it's why he signed the economic recovery tax there in 1981, because with his economic policy he was returning the American people's money to the American people. It was all about freedom and that's the way he looked at the ranch.BM: One of the great visuals to me at the ranch, you mentioned this comparison, that this was not an opulent palace for the rich and famous. One of my favorite visuals at the ranch is to walk into their bedroom and to see that it was two single beds pushed together and held together with a zip tie. Ronald Reagan could have had any mattress in the world and yet he's still did that. What do we learn from that?AC: You know, the bed is amazing because the ranch is such a humble place. And it's comfortable but it's modest, it's only about 1,800 square feet, there's no central air, no heating except for the fireplaces, and it's that bed that really sticks with people. Those twin beds were there in the home when they bought it. It was a working cattle ranch when the Reagans purchased what was then known as Tip Top Ranch. They renamed it Rancho del Cielo. And those beds were there, they pushed them together, used plastic zip ties and the headboard to keep them from sliding apart. At about 6-foot-1, Ron Reagan was tall for a twin bed. So you probably remember a bench at the end where his feet might hang over. Just the simplicity, the humility, the fact that as you walk from their sitting area, their living room, into the bedroom, you're not walking down the halls lined with pictures of the president with world leaders or with other movie stars from his Hollywood days. It just helps you understand, I think, how and why he was able to connect with the American people the way he was. There was a reason that people were so prepared to listen to him and what he had to say.BM: Yeah, there was an authenticity there that I think is quite unique in leadership. You mentioned earlier him working on the ranch, clearing the brush and so on. But you also mentioned this fence, which to me, I think, says a lot about just having something to come to. Describe a little bit about how this fence came about. And how it really became kind of his eternal mission to work on.AC: Well, like most of the projects at the ranch, the president didn't want to start something and then have somebody else finish it in his absence. He would pick up where he left off the next time he was at the ranch. It didn't matter what he was doing, that's the way he handled it. And the fence project is something he started in the mid 1970s, shortly after he purchased the ranch. He wanted to create a little corral next to the home, and learned that Pacific Bell had some used telephone poles available, made the call himself to make the arrangements to purchase the poles and have them delivered to the ranch. And he didn't finish the project until 1987. He'd get one section done, and one of his buddies who worked with them up there, Dennis LeBland, said they'd be sitting on the front patio and he could just tell by the look in the president's eye that he'd come with a new project, a new section of fence that he wanted to put in. That is certainly one of the ways he relaxed. I mean, he was out there with a chainsaw. He developed the plan for the fence himself, kind of an interesting thing, the polls arrived and they were 45 feet long. And he developed a way of cutting the polls down for the posts and the railings that used all the pole except for three feet. And those last three feet of the pole he used to put in steps leading from the home to the tack barn, which is set up a little hillside just above the Reagans' adobe. So again, just indicative of the way he thought about things. He got the poles and he wanted to use every last bit of them.BM: Now that's good frugality. And I think a good lesson in terms of just having something to go to, you know, to have a place to go to. Most people don't realize that he spent almost a full year of his eight years as president actually at the ranch. Is that right?AC: Yes, that's right, just over 350 days. So one of his eight years in office was spent here at the ranch, it truly was the Western White House.BM: So I want to shift to some of the principal components and some of the things that you're trying to pass on, especially through the Young America's Foundation, in terms of some of these important legacy pieces. But before we leave the ranch itself, I think there's one other experience and story that I think everyone needs to understand, just in terms of President Reagan's ability even as he was winding down and as the disease was progressing, that he was still worried about the people around him. And you mentioned his love to go out for the ride. I know they went through a few Secret Service folks with broken arms and limbs who couldn't keep up, but take us through a little bit of that history and then lead us up to the last ride at the ranch.AC: Oh you're asking a lot, Boyd. That's a difficult story to tell but I'll do my best. You're right. I mean, there's really nothing except perhaps spending time with Nancy that Ronald Reagan enjoyed more than his horses, more than getting out on the trail. And that was a challenge for the Secret Service. You know the Secret Service is pretty accustomed to the official responsibilities of the presidency. What really creates some unique challenges for them is what a president likes to do in his free time. Whether it's downhill skiing or powerboating or, in the case of Ronald Reagan, horseback riding. So they cycled through some details that really were not well-equipped to keep up with the president. He was an excellent equestrian, loved riding these rugged, rocky trails in the far reaches of the ranch property. Nearly 20 miles of trails snake through the scope of Rancho del Cielo. And so pretty early in the presidency, they assigned a young agent named John Barletta to come out to the ranch and ride with the president. John had a bit more riding experience in his background than his fellow agents. And after an initial ride that went just as they'd hoped it would, the President was able to do what he wanted to do and wasn't held back by John or the detail. John was told whenever the president so much as thinks about a horse you're going to be there. His fate was sealed. And you know, John was on the presidential protective detail when he was back in the White House. He traveled the world with the president, but their unique relationship was really formed through their hours and hours together on the trails at Rancho del Cielo in particular, but John rode with the president and Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle as well. And other places like Camp David, where the president had opportunities to ride. And ended up staying on his detail for 17 years, which is unheard of in the Secret Service. That's not a typical career path, probably will never be repeated. But John stayed with the president even after the presidency until John retired from the Secret Service in 1997.And then of course they'd become so close John was one of the few people who continued to visit the president at his home in Bel-Air all the way up until the end, all the way until the president passed away. So they really did have a unique bond and a unique relationship. But what you're referring to is John's account of what happened in 1994, that same year that the president wrote his letter announcing that he had Alzheimer's. And as I mentioned earlier, the president was still coming to the ranch regularly, still horseback riding. But that was becoming increasingly difficult, to the point where one day at the ranch on one of their morning rides, the president was having enough trouble with his horse that John ended up dismounting from his own horse and leading the president's horse in. And you know, this is something that's terribly embarrassing for John. Their whole friendship, their relationship is built around the horseback riding, and he's also worried, he's concerned about where they are. And so John talked to Mrs. Reagan when they returned from the ride and said, ""You know, I don't think I can protect him out there anymore. I think we need to stop riding."" And he thought that would be the extent of his responsibility. But Nancy had also became very close to John. She said, ""John, you're gonna have to tell him, he'll take it better coming from you.""Not what John wanted to hear. But he wasn't gonna say no to Nancy, and so later that afternoon, Mrs. Reagan called up to the Secret Service command post, which is still on the property. And said ""John, it's time, why don't you come down to the house."" John walks down the gravel drive, knocks in the front door, and there's the president sitting by the fireplace. John sits down in the chair opposite to him and says, ""You know, Mr. President,"" and as close as they got, he always called him Mr. President. ""You know, Mr. President, we're not having fun out there anymore."" John took that approach because he would tell you every morning before their ride, they would stand in the tack barn, look at a map of the ranch, scope out the plan for the day, the trails the president wanted to take. And the president would always say, ""John, do the fellows want to take this ride today, do the fellows want to see this spot?"" He wanted everybody else to enjoy the ride as much as he did. And so John said, ""We're not having fun out there anymore. I'm not enjoying it. And I don't think you are either."" At this point, of course, John is having a hard time getting the words out, he was tearing up and he said the president stood up from his chair and walked over to him, put his had on his shoulder and said, ""It's OK, John. I know.""And that was it. They never rode again. And they never talked about it again. And to John, that one mental moment typified their whole relationship. Here's one of the president's darkest days, nothing he enjoyed more than horseback riding. And he's thinking about how difficult this must be on John to break that news to him.BM: That's great. Thank you so much for sharing that, Andrew. I think it to me, that encapsulates not only the spirit of the ranch, but the spirit of the man, the president, and so much of what he was really all about, and why he connected so well with American people across the spectrum in such a powerful way. In just our remaining couple of minutes. Andrew, I want to just have you share briefly just kind of the vision of sharing these principles, these stories, these experiences, this great legacy of Ronald Reagan in what you're doing with the young people across the country.AC: Thanks, Boyd. So that is absolutely essential to understanding why we saved the ranch and how we use it today. The ranch itself is not open to regular public tours. Part of that is just the logistics of it. One of the things that the president loved so much about the place is that it wasn't easy to get to. He used to say when you get there, the world is gone. And it's not the sort of place you would have hundreds of thousands of people come through every year and preserve it as we are now. But it's also a matter of strategy. It's a matter of priorities. We think the most important audience we can reach with the ranch and the lessons that it holds are young people during those formative high school and college years. And that's what we've been doing throughout the history of Young America's Foundation. We were founded by Bill Buckley in 1960 in Sharon, Connecticut. By 1962, Ronald Reagan had joined our advisory board and was our honorary national chairman later in the '60s. And that started really four decades worth of working together to introduce young people to conservative ideas. We're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so we don't get involved in elections, campaigns, candidates, but we are unabashedly committed to making sure that at some point during their high school and college years, as many young people as possible in the country are introduced to the three enterprise traditional values: individual freedom, strong national defense, limited government — those core Reagan values that inspired his leadership, that were at the heart of the founding of our nation, and yet sadly, are too often shut out of the classroom experience for most young people.So we accomplish that mission through conferences and seminars across the country, through campus lectures and other campus initiatives, chapters on college and high school campuses all over the country. If you hear about Ben Shapiro, the most popular conservative speaking on campus or just about anywhere today, speaking on campus, that's thanks to his work with Young America's Foundation students and through the programs. Dinesh D'souza, Allen West, so many other great conservatives we send to campus. So the ranch has become really the essential training ground to accomplish all of that. And it is the one place where most high school students are introduced to the mission and programs of Young America's Foundation. We all know that a high school student today has the world in the palm of their hand with their smartphones. To really attract students to a program you have to offer something unique, an experience they can't get anywhere else. And the ranch does that for us. It gives young people who weren't even born during the Reagan years — think about a 14- to 18-year-old high school student born 2000 or after attending our programs. They have no firsthand knowledge of the Reagan presidency and yet they flock to Santa Barbara to walk in his footsteps, to learn more about his life and character, and then have that inspirational experience matched with the opportunity to hear from great conservative leaders that, sadly, they shouldn't have to travel to Santa Barbara to hear from, but just don't have access to anywhere else. And we have found that to be a powerful, powerful combination. Compelling ideas and speakers matched with the example of Ronald Reagan.BM: That's great. As we get to the close here, we always end our program with the Therefore, What? question. And it really is the where do we go from here moment. And I'm gonna let you be the final answer on Therefore, What? What should people take away after listening to us for the last 25 minutes, what do you hope they think different, what do you hope they do different? And as you're thinking of your Therefore, What?, to me that one the most poignant moments for Reagan was his 1980 convention address.You know this was long before Morning in America and a lot of the positive feelings and now here he was in a jam-packed stadium and as he got to the close of that speech, really the speech of his life to that point, and he could have thrown out any red meat political line in the book and the place would have gone crazy. But he didn't. He stopped, and it was almost as if you could see him at the ranch and he invited all of those who were watching on TV and those that were in that arena, that as we begin this journey together we can't do this alone. Would you join me in a moment of silent prayer? And so rather than ending with a red meat applause line, he ended with silence. And I thought that was just extraordinary, and I think he got that stillness, that silence from the ranch. And so that's one of my Therefore, Whats, as I think about the Reagan legacy, is that you don't always need the bombast, you don't always need the hyper-rhetoric, sometimes a little bit of stillness in a very turning world, as Reagan would say, really can be the answer and the solution.AC: That's powerful. I think that's really well said. That really does capture the appeal of the ranch to Ronald Reagan. And I think the continued appeal of the ranch today. I'd leave you with a couple more things. One, I was just reflecting on this with a friend earlier today, but think back to that incredibly powerful moment during the Reagan funeral service, memorial service at the National Cathedral when Margaret Thatcher's pre-taped address is played. So many great reflections surrounding his memorials, but for me that was the high point of the week. And every word she uttered was powerful. What really sticks with me is when she was talking about the great loss to the country and the world as Ronald Reagan is leaving the seed. But she reminded us that we have something that Ronald Reagan didn't. We have his example. And I think that is incredibly important. We we look around and it's easy to tear people down from high places. But I think it is very important to recognize who our heroes are, who is worth emulating. And to ensure that future generations are exposed to and learn the same principles. And that leads me to the second thing I would say, I mentioned that it is not necessarily the easiest thing to do to, to get to the ranch. But there are opportunities to visit, especially for any young people listening, especially if you have a young person in your life. If you care about instilling these values in high school students, who I would say no matter what kind of family they come from, is in desperate need of having these ideas, values reinforced, go to yaf.org, look at the lineup for our upcoming programs anywhere in the country, but particularly the high school conferences at the ranch and look for an opportunity to send that young person through one of these programs. They are life changing experiences, they form bonds with other students who care about the same ideas that last a lifetime. They're emboldened, they realize that there are incredible resources available to them so they can bring these ideas back to their own campuses. And then of course, they learned from the example of Ronald Reagan.BM: Fantastic, wonderful. Andrew Coffin, thank you so much for joining us today.AC: Thank you, Boyd, I appreciate so much what you do and what you and your family have done to support our mission at the ranch. We are grateful for your good work, for Sarah's good work, and look forward to lots of opportunities to collaborate.BM: Fantastic. Thank you so much.

Young people are drifting from the principles and values that have shaped America from its founding.

Ronald Reagan was the happy warrior and the great communicator. He was a president who challenged citizens to believe in themselves as well as their neighbors.Andrew Coffin, director of the Reagan Ranch and vice president of Young America's Foundation joins us to discuss the return of Reaganesque leadership, preservation of a legacy, and instilling principles in the rising generation on this episode of Therefore, What?All right, we are very pleased to be joined today by Andrew Coffin from the Reagan Ranch and Young America's Foundation. Andrew, thanks for joining us today.Andrew Coffin: Boyd, thank you so much for having me. Great to be with you.BM: Well, you have one of the great jobs in America, I always say, really preserving and protecting the Reagan legacy and particularly the Reagan Ranch. A lot of people think, when they think about Ronald Reagan or a place to go to, they often think of the Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, which of course has its place. But you're tasked with something that I think is really the heart and soul of who Ronald Reagan was. So tell our listeners a little bit about the Reagan Ranch and how it came to be and what its mission really is.AC: Boyd, the frequency with which people tell me I've got one of the best jobs in the world is a reminder that I need to keep looking over my shoulder. It's a job I want to hang on to. But it's true, it is one of the best jobs in the world and so much of that is wrapped up in this special place, Rancho del Cielo, Ronald Reagan's Western White House and the Reagans' home for 25 years.You're correct — it's not the Presidential Library. Our Presidential library system is an important repository of official documents and an important research institution. But I think one way to understand the difference is the way former Attorney General Ed Meese put it. He said you go to the library to learn about the presidency, you come to the ranch to meet the man. And I think that sums it up well. Today Ronald Reagan's ranch home in the mountains northwest of Santa Barbara sits almost exactly as it did when he so enjoyed it. You walk in the front door and his books are on the bookshelves, His clothes are in the closet, his saddles and chain saws are up in the tack barn. It really feels as though he never left and I think there's just something remarkably intimate, something very personal about walking in someone's footsteps, seeing the sorts of books they kept on the bookshelves, how they surrounded themselves in their most private moments, learning what they do with their free time. And visit to the ranch, as someone once said, is a window into Ronald Reagan's soul. It really tells you a lot about his character, his values.While most children’s excitement is bursting by the end of the school year, summer break can be a source of stress for...BM: Yeah, it really does. I've always said you can learn a lot about Ronald Reagan in books and other places. But until you've been to the ranch you really don't understand the man. The person and the place are so interwoven and so many critical lessons there. Give us just a brief peek, Andrew, into, you know, as things ended, as President Reagan wound down and as the family was looking at what to do with the ranch. Give us just a quick snapshot there. And then I want to get into some of the lessons from the ranch.AC: Sure. Many of your listeners probably remember that 1994 letter that Ronald Reagan wrote to the American people, that handwritten letter announcing that he had Alzheimer's disease. A powerful statement in its own right, you know. We quickly forget that people were much more hesitant to talk about Alzheimer's even back in the early '90s compared to the way we are today. And at that stage, in 1994, Ronald Reagan was still going to the ranch regularly. But the visits were becoming increasingly difficult. And they reached a point where it became clear he was not going to be able to continue enjoying the ranch. And they made the difficult decision to put the property up for sale. There were attempts at the state and federal level, and I won't go into all of that history, but it's important to understand that the ranch truly was in danger of being lost. The preservation efforts at the state and federal level failed, there were some interested parties who wanted to build homesites up there, a fair amount of national attention on this saga. And Ron Robinson, the president of Young America's Foundation, and our board of directors, decided to move quickly, that somebody had to act to ensure that this presidential site — and really I can't think of a more important site for conservatives in the country — was protected and preserved. So we were able to acquire the ranch directly from the Reagan family.April of 1998 was when the sale went through. And since that day, we've been using the ranch not only as a place to preserve history, as a place to tell stories about Ronald Reagan and the Reagan years, but as a place to introduce, particularly young people, high school and college students, to his values, his principles, his ideals.BM: That's such an important part of what happens there at the ranch. I remember the very first time I went and we started at the Reagan Ranch Center there in Santa Barbara, down in the valley. And I was so struck — you know, when most people think about the Reagan years, those that can remember them usually say everyone loved Ronald Reagan. The democrats loved Ronald Reagan, the Republicans loved Ronald Reagan, the media loved Ronald Reagan, and I was really struck that first time I went there that the very first thing that you show people as they come into the center is about a 4 1/2-minute video of every major political and media pundit that was alive at the time just ripping Ronald Reagan to shreds. I mean, from George H.W. Bush saying it was ""Voodoo economics,"" to all of the nighttime folks, you know, saying he was radical and dangerous and a threat to world peace. Tell me why you started with that. It's just such a great lesson.AC: We were really pleased with the way that exhibit turned out. It's called the Reagan critics. And you're right. It's a 4- or 5-minute film recounting some of the most vicious attacks on the president from left, right, middle, you name it and I have to tell you, when we when we first installed that exhibit I'm afraid some of our wonderful volunteer docents, who clearly love and admire and respect Ronald Reagan, that's the reason they give so much of their time to the center, they were shocked and horrified that we put in such an exhibit.But as you're suggesting, I think that is such a critical, important part of the story to tell for a couple of reasons. We do quickly forget, we have this image of Ronald Reagan today as a kindly, grandfatherly figure. And certainly that was part of his appeal. He made Americans feel good about themselves, the way a grandfather might. But it is of critical importance that we remember what he was up against, and how firmly he stood on the principles in which he believed, that he had spent decades developing, refining before he ran for the presidency in 1980. And so we think to truly appreciate his courage, his boldness, his fortitude, you have to understand what he was up against, the way he was attacked. There are also, as I'm sure you would relate to, there are eerie echoes of some of the rhetoric we hear today. And I think that is also a good lesson. As young people hear conservative leaders today viciously attacked and these horror stories about what's going to happen if conservative principles are turned into policy. We need to remember that Ronald Reagan faced the same thing and faced down the same critics.BM: I'm so glad you mentioned that, Andrew, because it is so easy to get caught in the later years of the Reagan presidency, where he was such a beloved figure, to realize that he did have to really stand up and speak out even against his own party, even against people who he thought were his friends. But to be able to do that, and then to achieve all of the things that he achieved, I think just speaks volumes there.I want to shift a little bit now, Andrew, and kind of visually take people up to the ranch. This is not an easy place to get to. So it really is a ranch in the sky, as the name suggests. Tell us about some of the people who've visited there and give us an insight into why you think Reagan was so drawn to that space.AC: Sure. Well, you mentioned the Reagan Ranch Center earlier. And I'm glad you brought that up because that is our schoolhouse for Reaganism in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara, just two blocks from the waterfront, easily accessible and also includes free exhibit galleries. And so that is a place that I encourage anyone interested in the ranch and the mission and work of Young America's Foundation to visit if you're anywhere near the Santa Barbara area.You're correct that the ranch itself is far more remote. It's tucked up on a peak in the San Ynez mountains, you take a winding, 7-mile mountain road to reach the entrance to the property. Certainly the sort of road that put off Mrs. Reagan the first time they visited the ranch when they were considering buying the place, but he instantly fell in love with it. And it became his retreat. There are so many ways you know, and we've been able to understand just how important this place was to Ronald Reagan. One indication is the amount of work he put into it. When he was at the ranch he wanted to get away from the Washington, D.C., lifestyle. He wanted to not only ride his beloved horses in the mornings, but spend the rest of the day clearing brush, chopping wood for the fireplaces, building telephone pole fencing, laying the stone patio in front of the home, retiled the roof himself, everything about the ranch reflects the President's own hand and what he invested in the property. You also know the significance of the ranch, as you suggested, by who he invited there. This was not a place they did a lot of entertaining, it really was a place they guarded closely. They wanted a retreat for the two of them to enjoy each other, where the President could think, reflect, pray, go back to Washington recharged. But they did invite Mikhail Gorbachev, George and Barbara Bush, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Margaret Thatcher, Brian Mulroney, the Prime Minister of Canada, to visit them there at the ranch. And I think Ronald Reagan, that there was something about him and his connection to that property that he thought they would better understand if they visited him at the ranch.Certainly, it was an eye-opening experience for somebody like Mikhail Gorbachev, who, though he espoused the principles of communism, lived as other as every other Soviet leader did with access to the retreats, the doctors and the Black Sea that were only available to the Soviet elite, which is not the sort of way that he was accustomed to meeting with an important world leader. But that was who Ronald Reagan was. And, of course, he often talks about the ranch. So many of the great letters that have been published, and speeches and addresses, his final words to the American people. His farewell address from the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan talks about the bittersweet prospect of leaving Washington, D.C., and the White House behind, but the joy of returning to California, the ranch and freedom. Those were two concepts that were always linked in his mind. I think it's why he signed the economic recovery tax there in 1981, because with his economic policy he was returning the American people's money to the American people. It was all about freedom and that's the way he looked at the ranch.BM: One of the great visuals to me at the ranch, you mentioned this comparison, that this was not an opulent palace for the rich and famous. One of my favorite visuals at the ranch is to walk into their bedroom and to see that it was two single beds pushed together and held together with a zip tie. Ronald Reagan could have had any mattress in the world and yet he's still did that. What do we learn from that?AC: You know, the bed is amazing because the ranch is such a humble place. And it's comfortable but it's modest, it's only about 1,800 square feet, there's no central air, no heating except for the fireplaces, and it's that bed that really sticks with people. Those twin beds were there in the home when they bought it. It was a working cattle ranch when the Reagans purchased what was then known as Tip Top Ranch. They renamed it Rancho del Cielo. And those beds were there, they pushed them together, used plastic zip ties and the headboard to keep them from sliding apart. At about 6-foot-1, Ron Reagan was tall for a twin bed. So you probably remember a bench at the end where his feet might hang over. Just the simplicity, the humility, the fact that as you walk from their sitting area, their living room, into the bedroom, you're not walking down the halls lined with pictures of the president with world leaders or with other movie stars from his Hollywood days. It just helps you understand, I think, how and why he was able to connect with the American people the way he was. There was a reason that people were so prepared to listen to him and what he had to say.BM: Yeah, there was an authenticity there that I think is quite unique in leadership. You mentioned earlier him working on the ranch, clearing the brush and so on. But you also mentioned this fence, which to me, I think, says a lot about just having something to come to. Describe a little bit about how this fence came about. And how it really became kind of his eternal mission to work on.AC: Well, like most of the projects at the ranch, the president didn't want to start something and then have somebody else finish it in his absence. He would pick up where he left off the next time he was at the ranch. It didn't matter what he was doing, that's the way he handled it. And the fence project is something he started in the mid 1970s, shortly after he purchased the ranch. He wanted to create a little corral next to the home, and learned that Pacific Bell had some used telephone poles available, made the call himself to make the arrangements to purchase the poles and have them delivered to the ranch. And he didn't finish the project until 1987. He'd get one section done, and one of his buddies who worked with them up there, Dennis LeBland, said they'd be sitting on the front patio and he could just tell by the look in the president's eye that he'd come with a new project, a new section of fence that he wanted to put in. That is certainly one of the ways he relaxed. I mean, he was out there with a chainsaw. He developed the plan for the fence himself, kind of an interesting thing, the polls arrived and they were 45 feet long. And he developed a way of cutting the polls down for the posts and the railings that used all the pole except for three feet. And those last three feet of the pole he used to put in steps leading from the home to the tack barn, which is set up a little hillside just above the Reagans' adobe. So again, just indicative of the way he thought about things. He got the poles and he wanted to use every last bit of them.BM: Now that's good frugality. And I think a good lesson in terms of just having something to go to, you know, to have a place to go to. Most people don't realize that he spent almost a full year of his eight years as president actually at the ranch. Is that right?AC: Yes, that's right, just over 350 days. So one of his eight years in office was spent here at the ranch, it truly was the Western White House.BM: So I want to shift to some of the principal components and some of the things that you're trying to pass on, especially through the Young America's Foundation, in terms of some of these important legacy pieces. But before we leave the ranch itself, I think there's one other experience and story that I think everyone needs to understand, just in terms of President Reagan's ability even as he was winding down and as the disease was progressing, that he was still worried about the people around him. And you mentioned his love to go out for the ride. I know they went through a few Secret Service folks with broken arms and limbs who couldn't keep up, but take us through a little bit of that history and then lead us up to the last ride at the ranch.AC: Oh you're asking a lot, Boyd. That's a difficult story to tell but I'll do my best. You're right. I mean, there's really nothing except perhaps spending time with Nancy that Ronald Reagan enjoyed more than his horses, more than getting out on the trail. And that was a challenge for the Secret Service. You know the Secret Service is pretty accustomed to the official responsibilities of the presidency. What really creates some unique challenges for them is what a president likes to do in his free time. Whether it's downhill skiing or powerboating or, in the case of Ronald Reagan, horseback riding. So they cycled through some details that really were not well-equipped to keep up with the president. He was an excellent equestrian, loved riding these rugged, rocky trails in the far reaches of the ranch property. Nearly 20 miles of trails snake through the scope of Rancho del Cielo. And so pretty early in the presidency, they assigned a young agent named John Barletta to come out to the ranch and ride with the president. John had a bit more riding experience in his background than his fellow agents. And after an initial ride that went just as they'd hoped it would, the President was able to do what he wanted to do and wasn't held back by John or the detail. John was told whenever the president so much as thinks about a horse you're going to be there. His fate was sealed. And you know, John was on the presidential protective detail when he was back in the White House. He traveled the world with the president, but their unique relationship was really formed through their hours and hours together on the trails at Rancho del Cielo in particular, but John rode with the president and Queen Elizabeth at Windsor Castle as well. And other places like Camp David, where the president had opportunities to ride. And ended up staying on his detail for 17 years, which is unheard of in the Secret Service. That's not a typical career path, probably will never be repeated. But John stayed with the president even after the presidency until John retired from the Secret Service in 1997.And then of course they'd become so close John was one of the few people who continued to visit the president at his home in Bel-Air all the way up until the end, all the way until the president passed away. So they really did have a unique bond and a unique relationship. But what you're referring to is John's account of what happened in 1994, that same year that the president wrote his letter announcing that he had Alzheimer's. And as I mentioned earlier, the president was still coming to the ranch regularly, still horseback riding. But that was becoming increasingly difficult, to the point where one day at the ranch on one of their morning rides, the president was having enough trouble with his horse that John ended up dismounting from his own horse and leading the president's horse in. And you know, this is something that's terribly embarrassing for John. Their whole friendship, their relationship is built around the horseback riding, and he's also worried, he's concerned about where they are. And so John talked to Mrs. Reagan when they returned from the ride and said, ""You know, I don't think I can protect him out there anymore. I think we need to stop riding."" And he thought that would be the extent of his responsibility. But Nancy had also became very close to John. She said, ""John, you're gonna have to tell him, he'll take it better coming from you.""Not what John wanted to hear. But he wasn't gonna say no to Nancy, and so later that afternoon, Mrs. Reagan called up to the Secret Service command post, which is still on the property. And said ""John, it's time, why don't you come down to the house."" John walks down the gravel drive, knocks in the front door, and there's the president sitting by the fireplace. John sits down in the chair opposite to him and says, ""You know, Mr. President,"" and as close as they got, he always called him Mr. President. ""You know, Mr. President, we're not having fun out there anymore."" John took that approach because he would tell you every morning before their ride, they would stand in the tack barn, look at a map of the ranch, scope out the plan for the day, the trails the president wanted to take. And the president would always say, ""John, do the fellows want to take this ride today, do the fellows want to see this spot?"" He wanted everybody else to enjoy the ride as much as he did. And so John said, ""We're not having fun out there anymore. I'm not enjoying it. And I don't think you are either."" At this point, of course, John is having a hard time getting the words out, he was tearing up and he said the president stood up from his chair and walked over to him, put his had on his shoulder and said, ""It's OK, John. I know.""And that was it. They never rode again. And they never talked about it again. And to John, that one mental moment typified their whole relationship. Here's one of the president's darkest days, nothing he enjoyed more than horseback riding. And he's thinking about how difficult this must be on John to break that news to him.BM: That's great. Thank you so much for sharing that, Andrew. I think it to me, that encapsulates not only the spirit of the ranch, but the spirit of the man, the president, and so much of what he was really all about, and why he connected so well with American people across the spectrum in such a powerful way. In just our remaining couple of minutes. Andrew, I want to just have you share briefly just kind of the vision of sharing these principles, these stories, these experiences, this great legacy of Ronald Reagan in what you're doing with the young people across the country.AC: Thanks, Boyd. So that is absolutely essential to understanding why we saved the ranch and how we use it today. The ranch itself is not open to regular public tours. Part of that is just the logistics of it. One of the things that the president loved so much about the place is that it wasn't easy to get to. He used to say when you get there, the world is gone. And it's not the sort of place you would have hundreds of thousands of people come through every year and preserve it as we are now. But it's also a matter of strategy. It's a matter of priorities. We think the most important audience we can reach with the ranch and the lessons that it holds are young people during those formative high school and college years. And that's what we've been doing throughout the history of Young America's Foundation. We were founded by Bill Buckley in 1960 in Sharon, Connecticut. By 1962, Ronald Reagan had joined our advisory board and was our honorary national chairman later in the '60s. And that started really four decades worth of working together to introduce young people to conservative ideas. We're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, so we don't get involved in elections, campaigns, candidates, but we are unabashedly committed to making sure that at some point during their high school and college years, as many young people as possible in the country are introduced to the three enterprise traditional values: individual freedom, strong national defense, limited government — those core Reagan values that inspired his leadership, that were at the heart of the founding of our nation, and yet sadly, are too often shut out of the classroom experience for most young people.So we accomplish that mission through conferences and seminars across the country, through campus lectures and other campus initiatives, chapters on college and high school campuses all over the country. If you hear about Ben Shapiro, the most popular conservative speaking on campus or just about anywhere today, speaking on campus, that's thanks to his work with Young America's Foundation students and through the programs. Dinesh D'souza, Allen West, so many other great conservatives we send to campus. So the ranch has become really the essential training ground to accomplish all of that. And it is the one place where most high school students are introduced to the mission and programs of Young America's Foundation. We all know that a high school student today has the world in the palm of their hand with their smartphones. To really attract students to a program you have to offer something unique, an experience they can't get anywhere else. And the ranch does that for us. It gives young people who weren't even born during the Reagan years — think about a 14- to 18-year-old high school student born 2000 or after attending our programs. They have no firsthand knowledge of the Reagan presidency and yet they flock to Santa Barbara to walk in his footsteps, to learn more about his life and character, and then have that inspirational experience matched with the opportunity to hear from great conservative leaders that, sadly, they shouldn't have to travel to Santa Barbara to hear from, but just don't have access to anywhere else. And we have found that to be a powerful, powerful combination. Compelling ideas and speakers matched with the example of Ronald Reagan.BM: That's great. As we get to the close here, we always end our program with the Therefore, What? question. And it really is the where do we go from here moment. And I'm gonna let you be the final answer on Therefore, What? What should people take away after listening to us for the last 25 minutes, what do you hope they think different, what do you hope they do different? And as you're thinking of your Therefore, What?, to me that one the most poignant moments for Reagan was his 1980 convention address.You know this was long before Morning in America and a lot of the positive feelings and now here he was in a jam-packed stadium and as he got to the close of that speech, really the speech of his life to that point, and he could have thrown out any red meat political line in the book and the place would have gone crazy. But he didn't. He stopped, and it was almost as if you could see him at the ranch and he invited all of those who were watching on TV and those that were in that arena, that as we begin this journey together we can't do this alone. Would you join me in a moment of silent prayer? And so rather than ending with a red meat applause line, he ended with silence. And I thought that was just extraordinary, and I think he got that stillness, that silence from the ranch. And so that's one of my Therefore, Whats, as I think about the Reagan legacy, is that you don't always need the bombast, you don't always need the hyper-rhetoric, sometimes a little bit of stillness in a very turning world, as Reagan would say, really can be the answer and the solution.AC: That's powerful. I think that's really well said. That really does capture the appeal of the ranch to Ronald Reagan. And I think the continued appeal of the ranch today. I'd leave you with a couple more things. One, I was just reflecting on this with a friend earlier today, but think back to that incredibly powerful moment during the Reagan funeral service, memorial service at the National Cathedral when Margaret Thatcher's pre-taped address is played. So many great reflections surrounding his memorials, but for me that was the high point of the week. And every word she uttered was powerful. What really sticks with me is when she was talking about the great loss to the country and the world as Ronald Reagan is leaving the seed. But she reminded us that we have something that Ronald Reagan didn't. We have his example. And I think that is incredibly important. We we look around and it's easy to tear people down from high places. But I think it is very important to recognize who our heroes are, who is worth emulating. And to ensure that future generations are exposed to and learn the same principles. And that leads me to the second thing I would say, I mentioned that it is not necessarily the easiest thing to do to, to get to the ranch. But there are opportunities to visit, especially for any young people listening, especially if you have a young person in your life. If you care about instilling these values in high school students, who I would say no matter what kind of family they come from, is in desperate need of having these ideas, values reinforced, go to yaf.org, look at the lineup for our upcoming programs anywhere in the country, but particularly the high school conferences at the ranch and look for an opportunity to send that young person through one of these programs. They are life changing experiences, they form bonds with other students who care about the same ideas that last a lifetime. They're emboldened, they realize that there are incredible resources available to them so they can bring these ideas back to their own campuses. And then of course, they learned from the example of Ronald Reagan.BM: Fantastic, wonderful. Andrew Coffin, thank you so much for joining us today.AC: Thank you, Boyd, I appreciate so much what you do and what you and your family have done to support our mission at the ranch. We are grateful for your good work, for Sarah's good work, and look forward to lots of opportunities to collaborate.BM: Fantastic. Thank you so much.

I am merely indicating that flogging or corporal punishment is for me a great deterrent to unwanted behaviour,"" he said.Hall told the Jamaica Observer following his speech at the Golf View Hotel that in his view ""no child over 15"" should be flogged and the punishment should not be carried out by the class teacher or anyone ""emotionally involved in the situation"". Also, he said it should not be carried out immediately but only after a ""process"" to determine the appropriate measure and also to explain to the student the reasons for the punishment.In a question-and-answer session at the tail end of his presentation, Hall — who is principal of Spanish Town High in St Catherine — confirmed that he was voicing his personal views on corporal punishment.He also made it clear that the Ministry of Education has a clear policy against flogging although the law still allows it in schools. He said the JTA has instructed its members to refrain from flogging children in order to avoid the possibility of legal action against them. ""Corporal punishment is still on our books in that (although) the child care and protection act outlawed corporal punishment in children's homes and places of safety, it is still legal in schools,"" said Hall.He noted, however, that ""there is illegality and then there is policy. The ministry's policy is to ban corporal punishment, so the association (JTA) has instructed its members not to perform corporal punishment because whenever it is done we recognise that whoever is the administrator ...could find him or herself on his own, without... legal backing"".While the Ministry of Education has turned its face against corporal punishment and the JTA has instructed teachers to desist from flogging, anecdotal evidence reaching the Observer suggests the practice remains in some schools.Late last year the Kensington Primary School in St Catherine was shrouded in controversy following a complaint by a parent that her nine-year-old had suffered corporal punishment.Down the years there have also been isolated reports of children suffering serious injury, as a result of accidents during flogging.Three years ago, a child lost the use of his eye after the buckle of a belt being wielded by a teacher accidentally hit him. That case is before the courts.Following the latter incident, then education minister in the Jamaica Labour Party Administration of the day, Andrew Holness, pledged that his Government would seek to pass legislation rendering corporal punishment illegal in schools. Holness and others noted that corporal punishment is in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Jamaica is signatory.Current Education Minister Ronald Thwaites, who took over as education minister following the People's National Party's election victory in December 2011, has been less assertive on the issue.In response to the case at Kensington Primary last year, Thwaites said: ""A clear policy has been given to schools that corporal punishment is not allowed with the normal running of the school and this is consistent with the laws and regulations.""But, he was also quoted as saying: ""I do accept that there will be very extreme cases of obstreperous conduct where a principal, having regard to age, circumstances and gender; may find it necessary to apply moderate corporal punishment. However, at no time should corporal punishment be used in order to enforce homework to be done or even work in a circumstance where a child has not done well in a test or in some exercise.""In seeking to explain his own views on the matter, Hall told Rotarians in Mandeville Tuesday that the formal removal of corporal punishment had left a ""vacuum"" in the system of administering discipline and had fuelled the practice of ""reprisals"" in schools. He appeared to suggest that children were socialised to accept flogging as legitimate when it is administered by ""institutionalised authority"" in a manner considered justified.""The child who receives the punishment (flogging) bears no ill will for the teacher because in that child's socialised opinion the teacher was merely carrying out his or her duty. A good teacher would have explained to the child prior to the flogging what it is you are going to be flogged for,"" said Hall.""What we have now is a removal of that method of punishment from our classroom. When child 'A' is slapped by Child 'B', he complains to the teacher.The teacher then uses counselling or speaks to the child or some other form of penal action. But the child who was inflicted does not view that as a means of exacting justice.""It therefore means that child B who was afflicted will seek to inflict his own form of justice at a time when it is convenient. It is this situation of reprisal that is causing most of the student-on-student violence we have in our institutions."" said Hall.Claiming he had first-hand experience of improved student behaviour because of the threat of corporal punishment, Hall said, ""I have come to the recognition that the promise or threat of corporal punishment is a greater deterrent than the corporal punishment itself.""However, he said, he also recognised that ""if you are forced to use corporal punishment regularly then you would also have misused it (and it would) not have the effect that it ought to have when used"".He suggested that the decision by the powers that be to ban corporal punishment in schools reflected a tendency to act without properly contemplating issues and the consequences of actions.Citing an example of what he believed to be inadequate thought, Hall referred to a recommendation that police be called when a child is found with an offensive weapon.""When corporal punishment was removed we were told that if a child comes to school with a knife or a weapon we should call the police,"" said Hall.But according to him, ""I will not report my 14-year-old to any police unless the situation becomes significantly troubling for that child or for other children"".He asked, ""How could I look in the eyes of a 17-year-old, who would have passed five or six CSEC (Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate) subjects and know that I prevented his future advancement because when he was 14 I gave him a police record?""""It is something teachers don't or won't do, and in that context the suggestion (from the Ministry of Education) was not feasible. We must now as educators look at education in terms of the development of the children, and anything that is going to enhance the student is what we must incorporate,"" he said.Hall said the authorities should refrain from adopting policies ""without giving it thought in our social and historical contexts...""The JTA head said that as a teacher he was committed to protecting children and to always giving them a chance to correct mistakes.""I am telling you that it is my fervent belief that I can reach each child, I was fortunate to have teachers who stood up for me and who guided me along the path, I was not always a very well behaved child,"" he said.""It is out of that reality I am convinced that if I can't reach child 'A' then I must find someone on my staff to reach this child, and if I can't find someone on my staff then I must find some friend who will be able to reach this child. I believe that all our children require a second chance and a third and a fourth. Many of us who now make policies, if those policies were in place while we grew up, we would have been truants and prisoners,"" he said.

Apparently some Texas lawmakers don’t like it either.The Texas Legislature is actively questioning daylight saving time this session. House Bill 49, authored by state Reps. Lyle Larson, R-San Antonio, and Dan Flynn, R-Van, would eliminate it.The more we learn about the psychological impact of sleep, the less it makes sense to keep daylight saving time around.Daylight saving time was popularized at the start of the 20th century as a way to make more use of daylight late in the day rather than sleeping through some of that daylight early in the morning. In this era of electric lights, television and computer screens, our lives are controlled less by the cycle of the sun than by the clock. That leads people to wonder why we still bother changing the clocks twice a year.Studies are consistent with most people’s experience of the time change. The extra hour of sleep in the fall is easier to adjust to than the lost hour in the spring. Our sleep-wake cycle is governed by a circadian rhythm that is slow to shift. We notice this most when flying across time zones and trying to adapt to the new time. But the shift to daylight saving time creates a version of jet lag in which there are several days that people get less sleep and sleep less well. This change can be particularly difficult for families with pets that do not understand why they are suddenly being fed or walked at a different time.Research on the impact of sleep deprivation demonstrates that the younger you are, the more the previous night’s sleep affects the next day. Children and teens are particularly vulnerable. Even an hour less sleep can make a child or teen more irritable. The lost sleep also disrupts their ability to study and to learn effectively. So, the school days after the spring time change are less efficient than the ones before the change.For older people, the effects of poor sleep are longer term. Middle-aged folks aren’t necessarily much more irritable or less effective cognitively when they have a night of bad sleep. But the worse people’s overall pattern of sleep in middle age, the higher their risk of dementia and other cognitive problems in old age.In general, the specific problems associated with the changes to and from daylight saving time are small and short lived. Although a few studies have demonstrated an increase in traffic and workplace accidents on the “sleepy Monday” after the time change, the evidence for an increase in accidents is weak at best.Given all this, why the fuss over daylight saving time?The big reason is that people in the United States generally have poor sleep habits. For one thing, the circadian rhythms that govern many body functions (including the sleep-wake cycle) are influenced by the sun, but most people don’t get a lot of exposure to sunlight throughout the day because of the amount of time we spend indoors.Screen time also influences sleep. The light from screens can make it harder to sleep. More important, the stimulation from what people are watching and doing with those screens makes it hard for people to wind down and sleep.On top of that, many people shift their schedules between weekdays and weekends, so that they stay up an hour or two later on weekend nights than they do on weeknights. That creates the equivalent of a daylight saving shift each week.In this context, daylight saving time creates one more factor that disrupts people’s ability to develop good routines around getting to sleep and staying asleep. Eliminating a factor that leads to poor sleep is a simple thing we can do to help people maintain better habits. It would also send a message from the government to the people of Texas that good sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. And in a state that prides itself on eliminating unnecessary regulations, this doesn’t seem like a decision our legislators would have to sleep on.Markman is a professor of psychology and marketing at The University of Texas at Austin.

So, the school days after the spring time change are less efficient than the ones before the change.For older people, the effects of poor sleep are longer term. Middle-aged folks aren’t necessarily much more irritable or less effective cognitively when they have a night of bad sleep. But the worse people’s overall pattern of sleep in middle age, the higher their risk of dementia and other cognitive problems in old age.In general, the specific problems associated with the changes to and from daylight saving time are small and short lived. Although a few studies have demonstrated an increase in traffic and workplace accidents on the “sleepy Monday” after the time change, the evidence for an increase in accidents is weak at best.Given all this, why the fuss over daylight saving time?The big reason is that people in the United States generally have poor sleep habits. For one thing, the circadian rhythms that govern many body functions (including the sleep-wake cycle) are influenced by the sun, but most people don’t get a lot of exposure to sunlight throughout the day because of the amount of time we spend indoors.Screen time also influences sleep. The light from screens can make it harder to sleep. More important, the stimulation from what people are watching and doing with those screens makes it hard for people to wind down and sleep.On top of that, many people shift their schedules between weekdays and weekends, so that they stay up an hour or two later on weekend nights than they do on weeknights. That creates the equivalent of a daylight saving shift each week.In this context, daylight saving time creates one more factor that disrupts people’s ability to develop good routines around getting to sleep and staying asleep. Eliminating a factor that leads to poor sleep is a simple thing we can do to help people maintain better habits. It would also send a message from the government to the people of Texas that good sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. And in a state that prides itself on eliminating unnecessary regulations, this doesn’t seem like a decision our legislators would have to sleep on.Markman is a professor of psychology and marketing at The University of Texas at Austin.

This really got me thinking, and instead of just jumping straight to what my opinion was, I decided to do some research about the pledge - not only to find out what it means, but also why it came to be what it is today.I discovered quite a few things I did not know before.I first found out that the pledge, created in 1892, originally read: “I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”In 1923 the words “the Flag of the United States of America” were added. Then again in 1954, President Eisenhower, in response to the Communist threat of the time, encouraged Congress to add the words “under God.” That formed the pledge we all know today: “I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”After doing my research I decided to break it down even further, to figure out what each segment of the pledge really means. “I pledge allegiance ...” - promising to be loyal.... to the Flag ...” - to the symbol of the country.... of the United States of America ...” - the country where many states and territories are brought together, each having their own rules and regulations.... and to the Republic ...” - a country in which we elect representatives from among ourselves to make laws for everyone.... for which it stands ...” - representing that our country is also standing strong.... one nation under God ...” - a country in which citizens are free to believe or not believe as they wish.... indivisible ...” - a country that will not be split apart. ... with liberty and justice ...” - a country that has established both freedom and a system of law. ... for all” - for every person in the United States of America, regardless of their differences.Many people don’t like the fact that it says that we are a nation that is under God, but that is because they are not aware of what exactly that means. That phrase represents our freedom to believe or not believe as we wish - the opposite of communism, and the reason Eisenhower added that.Although our Founding Fathers started this nation in accordance with the beliefs of the Bible, it has absolutely nothing to do with Christianity; in fact, it emphasizes the intent of the First Amendment, which states that we have the freedom of religion. So an atheist who says “one nation under God” is stating that he or she can choose not to believe in any God. And the pledge’s final phrase, “for all,” indicates that everything in the pledge applies to anyone and everyone in the United States, even those who are not citizens and are just visiting. So back to my original dilemma on whether or not kids should be forced to recite the pledge in schools.After I had completed my research I came to the conclusion that kids and adults should not be forced to recite the pledge. Our First Amendment right also states that we have freedom of speech, meaning we can say or not say anything we so choose.Although I believe that we should not be forced to recite the pledge in schools, or at any event in which it is being recited, I also believe that all schools should at least have a time where they lead students in the pledge every morning to start the day, and students can have the choice to recite it or not.Yes, I strongly believe in everything I have written, because I based it on facts. But I also love my country, and I stand out of respect and honor for the men and women who came before it and gave the ultimate sacrifice to protect these rights I have discussed here.

50,Fighting in Hockey,Should Fighting Be Allowed in Hockey?,1s50q2r,https://edmontonjournal.com/sports/hockey/nhl/cult-of-hockey/player-grades-missing-their-top-star-edmonton-oilers-fight-back-twice-to-earn-a-deserved-point,"Player grades: Missing their top star, Edmonton Oilers fight back twice to earn a deserved point | Edmonton Journal","What a weird team Edmonton Oilers are with their goalie on the bench this season. It’s sure happened a lot of times as the Oilers have trailed late in a lot of games. Many times the moment they pull the goalie the puck seems destined for the open cage as if drawn by a powerful magnet, such as last game when they allowed the clinching empty netter just 4 seconds after Mikko Koskinen left the ice surface. In all, they’ve allowed a ghastly 15 goals into their unguarded cage.But, it’s all worth it if once in a while the tactic pays off, right? No point losing by one. And on Tuesday night, the Oilers tied a game with their netminder on the bench for the third time this season, as Ryan Nugent-Hopkins slid one past Darcy Kuemper to successfully cap two minutes of full-court pressure with just 11 ticks on the clock.That was enough to tie the score 2-2, setting up a pulsating overtime frame. The Oilers dominated that session but failed to light the lamp again, before ultimately falling in the shootout to the visiting Arizona Coyotes.Half a loaf is better than the none they seemed destined for much of the night. The Oilers were missing superstar forward Connor McDavid (illness) and were staring at what seemed like a mountainous 1-0 deficit after 40 minutes. But after Ken Hitchcock rejigged the lines they found a way to tie the score not once but twice; alas they never were able to forge a lead.The Oil trailed on the shot clock 33-25 with just 2 minutes left in regulation, but outshot the ‘yotes 12-2 (!) the rest of the way. Arizona, who dominated the middle period, did have a 17-13 edge in Grade A Scoring Chances in a weird game that featured flurries of action surrounded by long stretches of grinding hockey, much of it constrained within a few feet of the boards. But a game in which the Oilers joined the battle and earned at least some sort of result.___There were plenty of thrills as the Oilers lost a tight won to the Coyotes, 3-2 in a shootout. David Staples and Bruce McCurdy of The Cult of Hockey dig into the play of Mikko Koskinen, Andrej Sekera, Leon Draisaitl, Colby Cave and Connor McDavid’s absence.___#2 Andrej Sekera, 4. A bit rusty in his return to action, and his pair with Benning spent too much time behind their own blueline. Lost a battle on the second Arizona goal. Did make a splendid stretch pass in OT that sent Cave in alone. 3 giveaways as he re-adjusted to the speed of the NHL.#4 Kris Russell, 5. His weak clearing pass was a big part of the problem on the first Coyotes goal, but he helped earn that back by contributing to the six-man cycle on the late tying marker.#6 Adam Larsson, 7. A very strong game that saw his pair tilting the ice in a favourable direction. Shots on net were 15-8 on his watch, with 6 of those shots coming off Larsson’s own stick. One of those actually found the back of the net to tie the score at 1-1 just when it seemed the Oilers might never score. Played his usual rugged defensive game, making one trip to the penalty box for an extra helping of grease on Clayton Keller, then not getting the call on a fairly obvious retaliatory penalty when Keller punched him. His mates had his back that time, and Larsson had theirs on three other kills on a strong night for the PK unit.#8 Ty Rattie, 6. Was shooting from everywhere, with 10 shot attempts, 7 of them on goal, in just 11 minutes of action. Many of them were bad angle shots that weren’t particularly dangerous. Did chip in on the crucial 6v5 sequence with a strong forecheck and a pass in the build-up to the goal. At one juncture in regulation the Oilers had 21 shots on net and Larsson and Rattie had 12 of them, not the distribution might normally expect. (Did I mention it was a bit of a weird game?) Wouldn’t have minded seeing one or both of them in overtime.#12 Colby Cave, 7. Another strong showing from the recent waiver wire pick-up. Played 15:38, including a couple of good shifts in overtime where he nearly won it on a breakaway. His impressive stat line included 7 shot attempts, 5 hits, and 8/14=57% on the dot, while the team as a whole outshot the Coyotes 8-1 during Cave’s 13 minutes of 5v5 play. Effective forechecker nearly chipped in on a goal when he picked off Kuemper’s errant clearing pass and fed Chiasson for what should have been an easy tap-in.#19 Mikko Koskinen, 7. The only reason the Oilers still had a chance after 40 minutes, Koskinen faced 35 shots including 17 Grade A scoring chances. Made a number of fine reaction saves; for such a huge man he has very quick legs. Got lucky on a couple of posts and a shot that got under his stick arm but got a little piece of his ribs and caromed barely wide. Didn’t get a lot of defensive help on either goal, both scored on slightly ugly rebounds. Beaten twice on splendid dekes in the shootout. 35 shots, 33 saves, .943 save percentage.#22 Tobias Rieder, 4. Played 13:47, almost all of it at evens, during which time he and his linemates were skating uphill (shots on goal +4/-7). Didn’t muster so much as a shot attempt, and appears to have the same amount of offensive confidence as he does goals — zero.#24 Brad Malone, 5. A late addition when McDavid fell ill. Oilers went nowhere at evens during his brief time, but he did make a nice contribution on the penalty kill with 3½ spotless minutes.#25 Darnell Nurse, 6. Played a monstrous 27 minutes with 2 shots, 2 blocks, 2 hits, and 2 minutes in penalties. Part of the d-zone problem on the first Arizona goal, but chipped in a secondary assist on the critical 2-2 tally. Involved in 6 Grade A chances for and 4 against in a high-event night. Took a penalty for holding after being walked by Alex Galchenyuk. Had a couple decent chances in overtime, one where he tried to drive himself, puck and all, right through Kuemper, Glenn Anderson-style.#27 Milan Lucic, 5. Had a fine scoring chance early in the game, but couldn’t cash, as usual. Now running another 11-game slide since his last goal. Had his issues defensively, especially on one awful shift of nearly 2 minutes duration where his line (with Draisaitl and Kassian) struggled to clear the zone, finally did but nobody changed, then got trapped in their own zone for another extended sequence. Did make one good defensive play late in the second.#28 Kyle Brodziak, 6. Held his own at even strength and chipped in with some fine work in 3½ minutes on the penalty kill. 5/7=71% on the dot.#29 Leon Draisaitl, 7. High-event game in shot shares and scoring chances. He was among the victims on both Arizona goals, but made up for that with a pair of primary assists on the two Oilers tallies. His bullet pass to RNH for the late tying goal was a joy to behold, and came at the end of a long and fabulous shift. Nearly put the game away with a couple of fine plays in overtime. 8/16=50% on the dot. A bull on the puck, he drew 2 penalties, the second giving the Oil an extended 5v3, alas they were unable to cash in. The workhorse played a massive 26:37 including 10:01 in the third and 3:15 in overtime. He was the only Oiler to beat Kuemper in the shootout giving the home team an oh-so-brief lead in the top of the second.#39 Alex Chiasson, 4. His once-hot stick has gone so cold he completely missed a wide open net after the gift from Kuemper. Played over 20 minutes but got little done, just 1 shot on net. Did have a couple of takeaways, but one ugly outlet pass that went directly between two teammates but a good ten feet from either.#43 Josh Currie, 5. Got the lap of honour to start his first NHL game, and gets the passing-grade of honour from me for simply achieving this milestone, no mean feat at any age let alone 26. Played just 5:25, was a bit deferential with the puck, but chipped in with 3 hits and error-free defensive play.#44 Zack Kassian, 7. Contributed in a number of ways with 3 shots, 2 blocks, 6 hits, and both an assist and a massive screen on Larsson’s tally. Also delivered 2:25 to the PK. Whiffed on a couple of glorious chances in tight off of Leon feeds in the third. Landed a massive hit on Galchenyuk, then drew an Oilers powerplay on the retaliation. Just the type of play he’s been on the wrong side of too often in the past, but not this time!#77 Oscar Klefbom, 7. Quiet efficient game that saw Oilers dominate in flow of play during his 19½ even-strength minutes (shots on goal +15/-5). No assist but an earned +1 for his early contribution to the Larsson goal. 2 shots, 2 hits, 2 takeaways, and too many small but positive plays to recount.#83 Matt Benning, 3. Struggled defensively and had little going on offensively in his return to the line-up from injury. His well deserved dash-1 on the second ‘yotes goal lowered his team leading plus/minus to +7. Second among active Oilers is Josh Currie who is “even” after 5 minutes of action; all other Oilers are minus. Flawed stat, but one that at minimum shows Benning isn’t getting crushed out there. (Though he was in this particular game.)#89 Sam Gagner, 6. Had 8 shot attempts including one decent jam attempt in overtime. 3 giveaways, but won a few possessions with a surprising 6/8=75% on the dot. His hands let him down on occasion with some jittery first touches. Took a penalty for low-bridging the slippery Clayton Keller.#93 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, 7. His line with Rieder and Gagner was in chase mode for much of the first two periods, but his game turned around in the third when he was promoted to LW on Draisaitl’s line. That’s a combination that this Oilers fan would like to see tried more often, not just when McDavid is unavailable. It sure paid off in spades as that reconstructed line produced both Oilers goals. Nuge made an early contribution to the first tally and scored the second in the dying seconds; he got open at the far side of the net, received Draisaitl’s bullet pass, was rejected on his first attempt but hung with it and powered home the rebound to earn the Oilers a valuable point and a fair shot at a second. Just 2/8-25% on the dot but 3 shots, 2 blocks, 2 hits in 23 minutes of work.___McCURDY: Oilers need to find right recipe for home cookingMcCURDY: Flurry of moves as Oilers reset rosterLEAVINS: Brandon Manning placed on waivers LEAVINS:  9 Things including the future of Jesse PuljujarviSTAPLES: Andrej Sekera recalled from BakersfieldLEAVINS:  Oilers re-acquire F Sam GagnerFollow me on Twitter @BruceMcCurdy -6°C-9°C365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com © 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Effective forechecker nearly chipped in on a goal when he picked off Kuemper’s errant clearing pass and fed Chiasson for what should have been an easy tap-in.#19 Mikko Koskinen, 7. The only reason the Oilers still had a chance after 40 minutes, Koskinen faced 35 shots including 17 Grade A scoring chances. Made a number of fine reaction saves; for such a huge man he has very quick legs. Got lucky on a couple of posts and a shot that got under his stick arm but got a little piece of his ribs and caromed barely wide. Didn’t get a lot of defensive help on either goal, both scored on slightly ugly rebounds. Beaten twice on splendid dekes in the shootout. 35 shots, 33 saves, .943 save percentage.#22 Tobias Rieder, 4. Played 13:47, almost all of it at evens, during which time he and his linemates were skating uphill (shots on goal +4/-7). Didn’t muster so much as a shot attempt, and appears to have the same amount of offensive confidence as he does goals — zero.#24 Brad Malone, 5. A late addition when McDavid fell ill. Oilers went nowhere at evens during his brief time, but he did make a nice contribution on the penalty kill with 3½ spotless minutes.#25 Darnell Nurse, 6. Played a monstrous 27 minutes with 2 shots, 2 blocks, 2 hits, and 2 minutes in penalties. Part of the d-zone problem on the first Arizona goal, but chipped in a secondary assist on the critical 2-2 tally. Involved in 6 Grade A chances for and 4 against in a high-event night. Took a penalty for holding after being walked by Alex Galchenyuk. Had a couple decent chances in overtime, one where he tried to drive himself, puck and all, right through Kuemper, Glenn Anderson-style.#27 Milan Lucic, 5. Had a fine scoring chance early in the game, but couldn’t cash, as usual. Now running another 11-game slide since his last goal. Had his issues defensively, especially on one awful shift of nearly 2 minutes duration where his line (with Draisaitl and Kassian) struggled to clear the zone, finally did but nobody changed, then got trapped in their own zone for another extended sequence. Did make one good defensive play late in the second.#28 Kyle Brodziak, 6. Held his own at even strength and chipped in with some fine work in 3½ minutes on the penalty kill. 5/7=71% on the dot.#29 Leon Draisaitl, 7. High-event game in shot shares and scoring chances. He was among the victims on both Arizona goals, but made up for that with a pair of primary assists on the two Oilers tallies. His bullet pass to RNH for the late tying goal was a joy to behold, and came at the end of a long and fabulous shift. Nearly put the game away with a couple of fine plays in overtime. 8/16=50% on the dot. A bull on the puck, he drew 2 penalties, the second giving the Oil an extended 5v3, alas they were unable to cash in. The workhorse played a massive 26:37 including 10:01 in the third and 3:15 in overtime. He was the only Oiler to beat Kuemper in the shootout giving the home team an oh-so-brief lead in the top of the second.#39 Alex Chiasson, 4. His once-hot stick has gone so cold he completely missed a wide open net after the gift from Kuemper. Played over 20 minutes but got little done, just 1 shot on net. Did have a couple of takeaways, but one ugly outlet pass that went directly between two teammates but a good ten feet from either.#43 Josh Currie, 5. Got the lap of honour to start his first NHL game, and gets the passing-grade of honour from me for simply achieving this milestone, no mean feat at any age let alone 26. Played just 5:25, was a bit deferential with the puck, but chipped in with 3 hits and error-free defensive play.#44 Zack Kassian, 7. Contributed in a number of ways with 3 shots, 2 blocks, 6 hits, and both an assist and a massive screen on Larsson’s tally. Also delivered 2:25 to the PK. Whiffed on a couple of glorious chances in tight off of Leon feeds in the third. Landed a massive hit on Galchenyuk, then drew an Oilers powerplay on the retaliation. Just the type of play he’s been on the wrong side of too often in the past, but not this time!#77 Oscar Klefbom, 7. Quiet efficient game that saw Oilers dominate in flow of play during his 19½ even-strength minutes (shots on goal +15/-5). No assist but an earned +1 for his early contribution to the Larsson goal. 2 shots, 2 hits, 2 takeaways, and too many small but positive plays to recount.#83 Matt Benning, 3. Struggled defensively and had little going on offensively in his return to the line-up from injury. His well deserved dash-1 on the second ‘yotes goal lowered his team leading plus/minus to +7. Second among active Oilers is Josh Currie who is “even” after 5 minutes of action; all other Oilers are minus. Flawed stat, but one that at minimum shows Benning isn’t getting crushed out there. (Though he was in this particular game.)#89 Sam Gagner, 6. Had 8 shot attempts including one decent jam attempt in overtime. 3 giveaways, but won a few possessions with a surprising 6/8=75% on the dot. His hands let him down on occasion with some jittery first touches. Took a penalty for low-bridging the slippery Clayton Keller.#93 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, 7. His line with Rieder and Gagner was in chase mode for much of the first two periods, but his game turned around in the third when he was promoted to LW on Draisaitl’s line. That’s a combination that this Oilers fan would like to see tried more often, not just when McDavid is unavailable. It sure paid off in spades as that reconstructed line produced both Oilers goals. Nuge made an early contribution to the first tally and scored the second in the dying seconds; he got open at the far side of the net, received Draisaitl’s bullet pass, was rejected on his first attempt but hung with it and powered home the rebound to earn the Oilers a valuable point and a fair shot at a second. Just 2/8-25% on the dot but 3 shots, 2 blocks, 2 hits in 23 minutes of work.___McCURDY: Oilers need to find right recipe for home cookingMcCURDY: Flurry of moves as Oilers reset rosterLEAVINS: Brandon Manning placed on waivers LEAVINS:  9 Things including the future of Jesse PuljujarviSTAPLES: Andrej Sekera recalled from BakersfieldLEAVINS:  Oilers re-acquire F Sam GagnerFollow me on Twitter @BruceMcCurdy -6°C-9°C365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com © 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Heller. In that case, the court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to have a gun in your home for self-defense.In his dissent, Judge Richard Clifton argued that the Second Amendment does not prevent licensing rules such as the ones used in Hawaii and other states.“Good cause licensing schemes, and extensive state regulation of public carry more generally, have a long history in the United States,” he wrote. “While explicitly declining to elaborate on specific regulations, the Supreme Court in Heller expressly noted that the right secured by the Second Amendment is ‘not unlimited’ and that there were ‘longstanding prohibitions’ that were ‘presumptively lawful.’”In a statement, Kaena Horowitz, deputy corporation counsel for the county of Hawaii who argued the case, said the state is considering all of its options, including whether to seek a full court review of the decision.""The Young decision is unfortunate as it invalidates Hawaii law designed to protect the safety and well-being of the people of Hawaii,"" he said.

51,Minimum Wage,Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?,1s51q7r,https://journalrecord.com/2019/02/20/seeking-a-higher-minimum-wage-should-oklahoma-follow-the-lead-of-surrounding-states/,Seeking a higher minimum wage: Should Oklahoma follow the lead of surrounding states? – The Journal Record,"(Photo illustration by Bryan M. Richter)OKLAHOMA CITY – State Sen. George Young wants to raise Oklahoma’s minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.50 per hour.To do that, Young, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, filed Senate Bill 102.Young said he wrote the bill because lawmakers should be talking about a living wage and not a minimum wage. “When you are talking about families you may have two or three people living on $7.25 an hour, that is not enough to survive on,” he said.Increasing the minimum wage, he said, would benefit all of the state.“Contrary to popular belief, the people who are being paid minimum are not just high school and college students,” he said. “They are working families. If you increase their pay they are going to turn right around and spend it.”Young’s counterpart in the House, state Rep. Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is on board, too. Munson’s House Bill 2133 would take the minimum wage to $15 per hour for state employees. She said her bill would apply to those public employees who didn’t receive a pay increase last year. She said the measure would increase hourly wages or the salary equivalent.But passing either bill won’t be easy.Republican lawmakers have killed several previous attempts at a minimum-wage increase, saying the increase would put a burden on the business community and cost jobs. During the spring of 2014, after a flurry of communities toyed with the idea of increasing their minimum wage, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1023 by Sen. Dan Newberry, R-Tulsa. The bill prevented any city or town from establishing a minimum wage.Then-Gov. Mary Fallin signed the measure on April 14.At that time, Fallin said mandating a minimum-wage increase at the local level would drive businesses to other communities and states and would raise prices for consumers. Most jobs in Oklahoma, she said, pay well above minimum wage.Trent England, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a right-leaning think tank, said Young was well-intentioned but warned that a minimum-wage increase could cost people jobs.In an interview with KFOR Channel 4, England said many younger workers and those who are in entry-level positions are paid minimum wage. An increase, he said, could reduce the number of those workers.“What happens often, when minimum wages are increased, is that a business is going to look for more experienced workers to fill jobs where they might have hired someone with no experience before,” he said.Still, the pressure to increase the minimum wage has increased.This year, 18 states saw increases in their minimum wage, according to a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those states include three states bordering Oklahoma: Colorado, Missouri and Arkansas. In Arkansas, voters approved a ballot initiative raising the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour this year and $11 by 2021. Missouri voters approved a new minimum wage of $8.60 for this year and $12 by 2023.Currently, 29 states have minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour.That pressure from surrounding states will continue to grow, said David Blatt, executive director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.“It’s been over a decade since we’ve seen a minimum-wage increase,” Blatt said. “Purchasing power has declined. If you adjust Oklahoma’s minimum wage for inflation, it’s at its lowest level ever.”With more than 600,000 Oklahomans receiving food stamps, Blatt said raising the minimum wage would put more money into the economy and lessen the demands on state services.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that, in 2017, about 16,000 of the state’s 900,000 workers earned less than minimum wage, while about 12,000 were paid at the minimum-wage level.Blatt said increasing that level would add to the economy. He said it was a myth that a minimum-wage increase would harm businesses.“You’re putting more money in the pockets of working families,” he said. “They are going to go out and spend it.”A low minimum wage, Blatt said, creates a disincentive to work.Even as lawmakers wrestle with the issue, many of the state’s tribal nations have moved to increase their entry-level wage. At least five of the state’s 39 federally recognized tribes have starting pay well above the federal standard of $7.25 per hour.Those tribes include the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Osage and the Muscogee (Creek). Research from 2012 shows tribal employment at more than 87,000 in Oklahoma.Despite the opposition, both lawmakers said they would continue to push for the increase. Munson said she was waiting and working to get her bill heard.“I’m trying to get others to work with me,” she said. “It’s always helpful when we have state employees share their personal story.”Young said he was taking the pragmatic approach – be flexible and be willing to deal.“If someone is willing to work with me, I’m willing to negotiate,” Young said. “I know going from $7.25 to $10.50 is a hike but I am willing to talk.”SB 102 has been assigned to the Senate Business, Commerce and Tourism Committee. HB 2133 has been referred to the House Appropriations and Budget Committee.Tagged with: Arkansas Cindi Munson Colorado David Blatt George Young minimum wage Missouri Oklahoma Senate Bill 102March 8, 2019March 8, 2019March 8, 2019Go ahead put what few unskilled workers that have jobs out of work.

George Young wants to raise Oklahoma’s minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.50 per hour.To do that, Young, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, filed Senate Bill 102.Young said he wrote the bill because lawmakers should be talking about a living wage and not a minimum wage. “When you are talking about families you may have two or three people living on $7.25 an hour, that is not enough to survive on,” he said.Increasing the minimum wage, he said, would benefit all of the state.“Contrary to popular belief, the people who are being paid minimum are not just high school and college students,” he said. “They are working families. If you increase their pay they are going to turn right around and spend it.”Young’s counterpart in the House, state Rep. Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, is on board, too. Munson’s House Bill 2133 would take the minimum wage to $15 per hour for state employees. She said her bill would apply to those public employees who didn’t receive a pay increase last year. She said the measure would increase hourly wages or the salary equivalent.But passing either bill won’t be easy.Republican lawmakers have killed several previous attempts at a minimum-wage increase, saying the increase would put a burden on the business community and cost jobs. During the spring of 2014, after a flurry of communities toyed with the idea of increasing their minimum wage, the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1023 by Sen. Dan Newberry, R-Tulsa. The bill prevented any city or town from establishing a minimum wage.Then-Gov. Mary Fallin signed the measure on April 14.At that time, Fallin said mandating a minimum-wage increase at the local level would drive businesses to other communities and states and would raise prices for consumers. Most jobs in Oklahoma, she said, pay well above minimum wage.Trent England, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs, a right-leaning think tank, said Young was well-intentioned but warned that a minimum-wage increase could cost people jobs.In an interview with KFOR Channel 4, England said many younger workers and those who are in entry-level positions are paid minimum wage. An increase, he said, could reduce the number of those workers.“What happens often, when minimum wages are increased, is that a business is going to look for more experienced workers to fill jobs where they might have hired someone with no experience before,” he said.Still, the pressure to increase the minimum wage has increased.This year, 18 states saw increases in their minimum wage, according to a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Those states include three states bordering Oklahoma: Colorado, Missouri and Arkansas. In Arkansas, voters approved a ballot initiative raising the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour this year and $11 by 2021. Missouri voters approved a new minimum wage of $8.60 for this year and $12 by 2023.Currently, 29 states have minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour.That pressure from surrounding states will continue to grow, said David Blatt, executive director of the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.“It’s been over a decade since we’ve seen a minimum-wage increase,” Blatt said. “Purchasing power has declined. If you adjust Oklahoma’s minimum wage for inflation, it’s at its lowest level ever.”With more than 600,000 Oklahomans receiving food stamps, Blatt said raising the minimum wage would put more money into the economy and lessen the demands on state services.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that, in 2017, about 16,000 of the state’s 900,000 workers earned less than minimum wage, while about 12,000 were paid at the minimum-wage level.Blatt said increasing that level would add to the economy. He said it was a myth that a minimum-wage increase would harm businesses.“You’re putting more money in the pockets of working families,” he said. “They are going to go out and spend it.”A low minimum wage, Blatt said, creates a disincentive to work.Even as lawmakers wrestle with the issue, many of the state’s tribal nations have moved to increase their entry-level wage. At least five of the state’s 39 federally recognized tribes have starting pay well above the federal standard of $7.25 per hour.Those tribes include the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Osage and the Muscogee (Creek). Research from 2012 shows tribal employment at more than 87,000 in Oklahoma.Despite the opposition, both lawmakers said they would continue to push for the increase. Munson said she was waiting and working to get her bill heard.“I’m trying to get others to work with me,” she said. “It’s always helpful when we have state employees share their personal story.”Young said he was taking the pragmatic approach – be flexible and be willing to deal.“If someone is willing to work with me, I’m willing to negotiate,” Young said. “I know going from $7.25 to $10.50 is a hike but I am willing to talk.”SB 102 has been assigned to the Senate Business, Commerce and Tourism Committee. HB 2133 has been referred to the House Appropriations and Budget Committee.Tagged with: Arkansas Cindi Munson Colorado David Blatt George Young minimum wage Missouri Oklahoma Senate Bill 102March 8, 2019March 8, 2019March 8, 2019Go ahead put what few unskilled workers that have jobs out of work.

I started to feel great!” he said.Neville, who played professionally for Manchester United for 10 years, found that you can get protein from a variety of plant-based sources including vegetables, seeds, peanuts, and quinoa. “These are all proteins that could just fill the gap of eating steak, fish, or chicken,” he explained.“It’s made me feel better. It’s made me feel healthy. And I read studies, I hope it makes me live longer,” the footballer added. Many sportspeople have ditched meat to improve their athletic performance. Manchester United defender Chris Smalling recently said that his vegan diet helps him to stay injury-free, adding that he feels “fresher” than before.Neville believes more people will make the switch. “I think it’s become more and more fashionable now. I think people are understanding the benefits, not just for yourself but for actually the environment,” he said.He continued, “2.5 million animals a day are being slaughtered. That is a damning statistic that we need to do something about.

3,Vaping E-Cigarettes,Is Vaping with E-Cigarettes Safe?,1s3q10r,http://theconversation.com/vaping-how-safe-is-it-101266,Vaping: how safe is it?,"A survey of adolescents carried out by researchers at Coventry University has shown that than less than half of e-cigarette users knew that vape products contain nicotine or that they are addictive, raising the possibility that they could be a gateway to smoking normal cigarettes. Nicotine addiction is a real problem but the health issues posed by e-cigarettes are potentially greater than just addiction.The first Europeans to arrive in America at the end of the 15th century soon encountered the local custom of smoking tobacco – and they in turn introduced the practice to Europe. Successive English monarchs were opposed to it – King James I famously wrote a book entitled A Counterblaste to Tobacco – but, in the end, governments settled on taxing it.The compound responsible for the pleasurable aspects of smoking tobacco (and for its addictive properties) is nicotine, a “secondary metabolite” produced by the tobacco plant Nicotiana tabacum as a defence against herbivores.Smoking tobacco destroys most of the molecules present in it, including nicotine, but the small amount of nicotine that survives (around 10%) is carried from the lungs, via the blood, to the brain within less than ten seconds. Once in the brain, it stimulates the release of neurotransmitters, including the “pleasure molecule” dopamine. The link between taking a “drag” on the cigarette and the brain’s “pleasure” response explains why smoking can be so addictive, as it associates pleasure with the act of smoking.Most of the dangers of smoking do not come directly from nicotine. Cigarette smoke contains around 4,000 different compounds and the most dangerous molecules are carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene and nitrosamines such as N’-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), which is derived from nicotine. Tobacco “tar”, which is carried in the smoke to the mouth and lungs, is rich in these toxic substances.If you smoke tobacco, the smoke damages the DNA in organs exposed to it as well as others indirectly exposed, speeding up genetic mutations and increasing the risk of cancer – not just of the lung, but also of the mouth, larynx, liver, cervix, oesophagus, pancreas, bladder and kidney. Not all these mutations lead to cancer, but the more of them there are, the more likely it is that cancer-causing mutations will occur.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), smoking-related disease causes around six million deaths a year (about 600,000 of these from “passive smoking”). Around 100,000 of these deaths occur in the UK and half a million in the US. Nicotine does not cause these deaths directly, but addiction to nicotine does.Within the past decade or so, e-cigarettes have been marketed as a way to enjoy smoking with fewer of the health risks of traditional cigarettes – for one thing, as e-cigarettes don’t burn tobacco, they should eliminate the risks associated with tar. They contain a battery, a metal heating element and a reservoir of liquid, which is converted to a vapour by the heating element and is inhaled by the smoker. The liquid is made up of a solvent, either glycerol or propylene glycol, nicotine, and often food-grade flavourings.So what’s the problem with e-cigarettes, if they do not produce carcinogenic tar? Well, nicotine or other molecules found in e-cigarettes can still affect lung health. A significant number of the flavour chemicals used in many liquids are aldehydes, and these are often irritants of the mucosal tissue in the respiratory tract when inhaled.Typical examples are cinnamaldehyde (cinnamon), vanillin (vanilla) and diacetyl (buttery). Tests on endothelial cells, the cells which line the blood vessels and the inside of the heart, show that some e-cigarette flavourings and their constituents (such as vanillin, cinnamaldehyde, diacetyl, isoamyl acetate and menthol) may harm blood vessels. They caused higher levels of an inflammatory marker (interleukin-6) and lower levels of nitric oxide, a molecule with several roles, such as inhibiting inflammation and clotting, and dilating blood vessels. In the body, these two changes are considered to be an early predictor of heart disease. Although the food flavourings are in themselves safe when used in food (as are the solvents) that does not mean they necessarily are entirely safe for a different use, such as in e-cigarettes. Studies have shown that some of these molecules, notably the solvents, can be decomposed when heated to above 300°C by the heating element in the e-cigarette. Three substances, all aldehydes, formed on the breakdown of glycerol and propylene glycol have come in for particular attention – acrolein, methanal and ethanal.You’ve probably met acrolein (propenal) – it’s the chemical formed when cooking oil is heated until it begins to smoke. It is toxic and can severely irritate eyes and nasal passages. Ethanal (acetaldehyde) and methanal (formaldehyde) are also toxic – methanal, in particular, is a well-known carcinogen.These substances may also be formed by decomposition of the flavouring molecules.So are these molecules produced at dangerous concentrations in e-cigarettes? While use of e-cigarettes has been shown to lead to significantly lower levels of certain carcinogenic metabolites in the urine of their smokers, compared to the levels found in smokers of traditional cigarettes, they have been linked with higher levels of some particulates, including the metals cadmium, nickel, chromium, lead and zinc. These may have originated in the heating coil.There is particular concern that the rapid growth in the use of e-cigarettes has not been accompanied by proper assessment of the risks accompanying their use, especially over the long term. While some reports have said that e-cigarettes are much safer than conventional cigarettes, one study has concluded that regular use of e-cigarettes by young people leads to them becoming heavier smokers of conventional cigarettes; another American study concluded that use of e-cigarettes by teenagers doubles the risk of coughs and bronchitis compared with non-smokers. E-cigarettes are freely available in the UK, and US, but are banned or restricted in some countries, including Norway, Brazil, Singapore and Australia. A letter published in the British Medical Journal also warned:Further basic science and epidemiological research is needed to increase our evidence base on the benefits and harms of e-cigarette vapour. Until then patients should not be misled into thinking that the likelihood of future harm is negligible when there is insufficient evidence to advocate this.At present, then, the bottom line is that no one knows whether there are long-term risks associated with e-cigarettes.

4,Vaccines for Kids,Should Any Vaccines Be Required for Children?,2s4q3r,https://www.lincolncourier.com/news/20190225/measles-outbreak-highlights-vaccination-issues,"Measles outbreak highlights vaccination issues - News - Lincoln Courier - Lincoln, IL","Subscribe to Lincoln CourierIt may be a 90-minute drive away, but an ongoing outbreak of measles in Champaign County worries Amber Shipman of Springfield.Her 15-year-old son, Aaron, received a bone-marrow transplant for treatment of leukemia in 2018, and so the Lutheran High School freshman again must go through vaccinations for measles, mumps and other preventable childhood diseases after the transplant erased his immunity.For the next few months, while he receives rounds of shots, Aaron will be especially susceptible to measles, a potentially life-threatening condition that can be spread through the air in public places and is highly contagious.Amber Shipman knows that Interstate 72 is a heavily traveled route between the capital city and Champaign-Urbana. She said an infected person without symptoms could bring measles to Springfield and spread it to Aaron and other people who haven’t been immunized, whose immune systems have been compromised or who can’t receive vaccines for a medical reason.“It scares me because he really doesn’t have any control over this,” she said. “He’s essentially at school with no protection.”The outbreak of measles in Champaign County, where four cases have been diagnosed — all but one among unvaccinated people and three involving students or staff at the University of Illinois’ Urbana-Champaign campus — has alarmed some parents and health professionals in the Springfield area.They remain concerned about periodic measles outbreaks across the country, including a measles outbreak affecting more than 60 people, many of them children, in southwestern Washington state.Health officials say the outbreaks indicate there’s a small but growing number of parents nationwide who are skeptical or openly hostile to the proven benefits of vaccines to protect against childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough.Some parents continue to believe that vaccines cause autism and other developmental disabilities even though that theory has been disproven, according to Dr. Douglas Carlson, chief of pediatrics at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and medical director of HSHS St. John’s Children’s Hospital.Conspiracy theories on the Internet about the influence of pharmaceutical companies, as well as doubt cast by celebrities, have resulted in parents “looking at pseudo-science and ignoring real science,” Carlson said.The result in Springfield, he said, is that more parents over the past decade are saying they know what’s best for their children when it comes to vaccines after “doing their own research. ... They are intelligent people who are misguided in their thinking.”Carlson estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of parents bringing their children to SIU’s pediatricians and family medicine doctors are inquiring about delaying or stretching out the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines even though there’s no benefit to do so and any delays are putting kids at risk of death or disability.“The science is solid,” Carlson said. “Vaccines are safe and effective.”SIU doctors don’t kick families out of their practices if parents want to vary from the vaccination schedule or avoid vaccines, he said.Instead, Carlson said doctors work hard to convince parents that they are potentially sacrificing their children to the ravages of preventable diseases and endangering other children and adults who are susceptible to infection for medical reasons.Carlson remains concerned about the future.“I think what’s happening in Washington is a warning of what might happen here,” he said.Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said she is confident the outbreak in her community has been relatively contained because of the “herd immunity” that results from an immunization rate in Champaign and Urbana schools exceeding 95 percent.“I look at this as a brush fire,” she said.Sangamon County schools, and Illinois schools on average, post similar immunization levels, based on information from the Illinois State Board of Education. The lowest immunization rates in Illinois tend to be at parochial schools.There hasn’t been a diagnosed measles case in Sangamon County in 10 years or more, according to Gail O’Neill, interim director of the Sangamon County Department of Public Health.Scientific evidence suggests that herd immunity can be lost, making disease transmission more likely, when the proportion of unimmunized children exceeds 7 percent to 10 percent of the school population, Carlson said.In Washington’s Clark County, where a measles outbreak began in late December, 78 percent of schoolchildren are current with all of their immunizations, according to the Washington Department of Health.Pryde credited the Illinois General Assembly for helping to contain epidemics of childhood diseases when it eliminated the “personal belief” exemption for childhood vaccinations in 2015.Before that time, parents were able to simply cite philosophical concerns when opting not to have their kids get shots.The only exemptions that remain for Illinois parents and guardians — exemptions that allow their children to avoid being excluded from public and private schools — cite “religious” and “medical” reasons for avoiding vaccines.Homeschooled children in Illinois aren’t covered by any vaccination requirements.Washington and 16 other states, including Wisconsin and Michigan, still allow personal-belief exemptions. Washington’s health department is trying to convince its state lawmakers to eliminate personal and religious exemptions, said Dr. Scott Lindquist, Washington’s state epidemiologist.The opposition to vaccines in Washington cuts across income groups and also can be fueled by overall mistrust of government, Lindquist said.In addition, he favors efforts by the United States to quell measles epidemics in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. Outbreaks overseas have helped to increase infections in the United States because of relatively easy international travel, he said.Pryde and Carlson said Illinois should eliminate the religious exemption, though there is no ongoing campaign to do so, and the Illinois Department of Public Health isn’t pushing for a repeal.A 2016 report by the Illinois State Board of Education said the share of students whose parents invoked religious exemptions to vaccines had grown at a small rate — 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent since 2010-11.Dr. Jennifer Layden, chief medical officer for the state health department, said data don’t indicate that vaccination levels are dropping statewide. But because of more measles outbreaks across the country, she said Illinois officials began to analyze vaccination rates at the local level a few months ago.All states allow medical exemptions, and a few states, including California, Mississippi and West Virginia, don’t allow personal or religious exemptions.None of the world’s major religions opposes childhood vaccinations, Carlson said.“I am concerned that the religious exemption is being used by people who don’t really have religious concerns,” he said.Even medical exemptions can be abused if parents are working with an unscrupulous doctor, according to Jagdish Khubchandani, a community health professor at Ball State University in Indiana.He said 127 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 10 states from Jan. 1 to Feb. 14, including the Illinois outbreak and in California, Colorado, Kentucky, New York and Texas.Khubchandani said any efforts to reduce religious and medical loopholes and hold parents accountable — criminally or civilly — for denying their children vaccines should be pursued.“I don’t think you should be risking a child’s life,” he said.The professor said vaccine has reduced measles cases in the United States by more than 95 percent since the 1960s and saved more than 20 million lives worldwide since 2000.In Springfield School District 186, 38 students went unimmunized for measles in the 2017-18 academic year because of religious exemptions, according to ISBE data.The students without vaccinations included seven at Springfield High School, six at Iles Elementary, five each at Southern View Elementary and the Early Learning Center, three apiece at Dubois and Lindsay elementary, two at Ball Charter, and one apiece at Lincoln Magnet and at Enos, Lee, Ridgely, Feitshans, Harvard Park and Graham elementary schools.Susan Smith, a school nurse at Springfield’s Franklin Middle School, said she speaks for herself in favoring elimination of the religious exemption.

Measles outbreak highlights vaccination issues - News - Lincoln Courier - Lincoln, IL Subscribe to Lincoln CourierIt may be a 90-minute drive away, but an ongoing outbreak of measles in Champaign County worries Amber Shipman of Springfield.Her 15-year-old son, Aaron, received a bone-marrow transplant for treatment of leukemia in 2018, and so the Lutheran High School freshman again must go through vaccinations for measles, mumps and other preventable childhood diseases after the transplant erased his immunity.For the next few months, while he receives rounds of shots, Aaron will be especially susceptible to measles, a potentially life-threatening condition that can be spread through the air in public places and is highly contagious.Amber Shipman knows that Interstate 72 is a heavily traveled route between the capital city and Champaign-Urbana. She said an infected person without symptoms could bring measles to Springfield and spread it to Aaron and other people who haven’t been immunized, whose immune systems have been compromised or who can’t receive vaccines for a medical reason.“It scares me because he really doesn’t have any control over this,” she said. “He’s essentially at school with no protection.”The outbreak of measles in Champaign County, where four cases have been diagnosed — all but one among unvaccinated people and three involving students or staff at the University of Illinois’ Urbana-Champaign campus — has alarmed some parents and health professionals in the Springfield area.They remain concerned about periodic measles outbreaks across the country, including a measles outbreak affecting more than 60 people, many of them children, in southwestern Washington state.Health officials say the outbreaks indicate there’s a small but growing number of parents nationwide who are skeptical or openly hostile to the proven benefits of vaccines to protect against childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella and whooping cough.Some parents continue to believe that vaccines cause autism and other developmental disabilities even though that theory has been disproven, according to Dr. Douglas Carlson, chief of pediatrics at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine and medical director of HSHS St. John’s Children’s Hospital.Conspiracy theories on the Internet about the influence of pharmaceutical companies, as well as doubt cast by celebrities, have resulted in parents “looking at pseudo-science and ignoring real science,” Carlson said.The result in Springfield, he said, is that more parents over the past decade are saying they know what’s best for their children when it comes to vaccines after “doing their own research. ... They are intelligent people who are misguided in their thinking.”Carlson estimated that 5 percent to 10 percent of parents bringing their children to SIU’s pediatricians and family medicine doctors are inquiring about delaying or stretching out the recommended schedule of childhood vaccines even though there’s no benefit to do so and any delays are putting kids at risk of death or disability.“The science is solid,” Carlson said. “Vaccines are safe and effective.”SIU doctors don’t kick families out of their practices if parents want to vary from the vaccination schedule or avoid vaccines, he said.Instead, Carlson said doctors work hard to convince parents that they are potentially sacrificing their children to the ravages of preventable diseases and endangering other children and adults who are susceptible to infection for medical reasons.Carlson remains concerned about the future.“I think what’s happening in Washington is a warning of what might happen here,” he said.Julie Pryde, administrator of the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said she is confident the outbreak in her community has been relatively contained because of the “herd immunity” that results from an immunization rate in Champaign and Urbana schools exceeding 95 percent.“I look at this as a brush fire,” she said.Sangamon County schools, and Illinois schools on average, post similar immunization levels, based on information from the Illinois State Board of Education.

29,Climate Change,Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?,1s29q8r,http://www.ipsnews.net/2019/02/devastating-climate-change-world-peace-security/,How Devastating is Climate Change for World Peace & Security? | Inter Press Service,"Saturday, March 9, 2019Catherine McKenna, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeUNITED NATIONS, Feb 13 2019 (IPS) - When the Security Council, the most powerful body at the United Nations, met last month to discuss the growing new threats to world peace and security, the discussion veered away from international terrorism, nuclear Armageddon and the rash of ongoing military conflicts in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. And 83 of the 193 member states remained collectively focused on one of the greatest impending dangers to humanity: the devastation that could be triggered by climate change.In an interview with IPS, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna best captured the grim scenario when she declared: “Whether the issue is desertification in parts of Africa, forced migration of vulnerable people in Central America, conflict over water scarcity, or rising sea levels and tropical storms for small island states, the security aspects of climate change are pressing and multifaceted.”Addressing the Security Council, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, Rosemary DiCarlo, warned that climate change affects peace and security in indirect but serious ways.In the Sahel, she said, competition for resources has fuelled tensions between herders and farmers; in the Lake Chad Basin, drought has reduced economic opportunities and threatened the livelihoods of many who are turning to armed groups; and in Asia, studies have shown a link between the impact of climate change on livelihoods and the intensity of civil conflicts.She also pointed out that climate-related displacement is “an acute problem which drives up local tension, as well as human trafficking and child exploitation.”In her wide-ranging interview, the Canadian Minister said as part of her country’s $2.65 billion pledge to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts, Canada has increased its adaptation support to the poorest and most vulnerable populations impacted by climate change.This funding includes support for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), some of them, including the Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati, are in danger of being wiped off the face of the earth because of sea-level rise.Excerpts from the interview:IPS: The United Nations has recognized climate change as one of the greatest long-term challenges to international peace and security. How best would you characterize these challenges?MINISTER McKENNA: The impact of climate change goes beyond the environment. At the national, regional and global levels, climate change is having a significant effect on economies, social development and peace and security, particularly in fragile contexts where it is a threat multiplier to governance challenges.The increased frequency, severity and magnitude of extreme weather events all over the world – one of the most immediate and visible results of climate change– will likely continue to generate humanitarian crises.Canada also recognizes that women and girls are disproportionately affected by the adverse effects of the changing climate and we stress the importance of addressing their needs as countries build back better.Canada’s International Assistance and Defence Policies recognize that climate change poses a serious security challenge and must be addressed to sustain development and peace and security gains.The Government of Canada believes that an integrated approach to addressing climate change is essential to fully account for social, economic, political and security impacts globally and that multilateral consensus is key to achieving sustainable development, peace and security, noting the importance of involving women and girls in decision-making around environment and climate action issues.IPS: The countries most vulnerable to climate change are the 57 small island developing states (SIDS)—some of whom like the Maldives, Tuvalu and Kiribati, may be wiped off the face of the earth due to sea level rise and natural disasters. Do you think the international community – and specifically the United Nations – is adequately responding to these dangers with concrete actions on climate resilience and funding for adaptation?MINISTER McKENNA: Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global solution. At COP21 in Paris, the global community came together to strengthen the global response to climate change including by: enhancing adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability to climate change; providing financial resources to support developing countries in their transition toward a lower carbon future; and holding the average global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while striving to limit the increase to 1.5°C.With the adoption of the Paris Rulebook in 2018, all countries including major economies are moving forward with this commitment.As part of Canada’s $2.65B pledge to support developing countries in their mitigation and adaptation efforts, Canada has increased its adaptation support to the poorest and most vulnerable populations impacted by climate change. This funding includes support for Small Island Developing States (SIDS).Canada is providing $60M to establish a Renewable Energy in Small Island Developing States Program at the World Bank to support the planning and construction of renewable energy infrastructure, energy efficiency and battery storage solutions.Canada is providing $300M to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to advance projects that support the transition of SIDS, Least Developed Countries, and African States towards clean and climate-resilient economies.Of note, the GCF is supporting the Pacific Islands Renewable Energy Investment Program in seven SIDS (the Cook Islands, Tonga, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru and Samoa), which is expected to reduce 120,000 tonnes of Co2 per year, while increasing the penetration of renewables in these markets.Canada is providing $30M to respond to the urgent adaptation needs of developing countries through the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). As of 2016, the Fund has approved US$1B for projects in 40 countries, including nine SIDS, such as Tuvalu, the Maldives, and Kiribati. IPS: In November 2015, during the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting (CHOGM) in Malta, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced grants amounting to $2.65 billion over a five year period to help developing nations in their battle against climate change. With 2020 as the expiry date, how much of these funds have been disbursed and who are the recipients? Will there be further grants after 2020?MINISTER McKENNA: Canada is delivering $2.65B in climate finance to developing countries. To date, over $1.5B worth of projects have been announced in the form of grants and concessional financing. This pledge covers FY 2015/16 to 2020/21.(The link to recent announcements: https://climate-change.canada.ca/finance/RecentAnnouncements-AnnoncesRecentes.aspx.)Funding beyond 2020/21 will require a decision from the Government of Canada.IPS: The scarcity of water, triggered primarily by climate change, is also responsible for current and past water conflicts and marine disputes, including confrontations between Israel and Jordan, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Palestine and Israel, (not excluding Bolivia, Peru and Chile.). Do you think the situation will get any worse with new conflicts on the horizon?MINISTER McKENNA: Canada recognizes that water, if not governed effectively in a fair and inclusive manner, can act as a conflict driver.Water in abundance may lead to devastating floods, while water scarcity leads to drought, both of which have significant political, social, environmental and economic implications.The acceleration of climate change, the increased frequency of drought and flooding, the increasing variation in water flows, the growing volume of hydro generation necessary for agriculture, energy production and human consumption are all conspiring to make access to water, water management and water security a critical global challenge.Areas that are already struggling with challenges, such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, and/or fragile political institutions, are particularly vulnerable to these changes.Canada also recognises that women are the most susceptible to bear the impacts of these changes, and of potential ensuing conflicts.In the future, problems such as water shortage, low water quality, or floods are increasingly likely to exacerbate existing social tensions. This can undermine economic development in various countries and could increase the risk of instability.However, despite the complexity of the challenges, water is also a resource for collaboration. While the past 50 years have seen approximately 40 cases of acute violent water conflicts, they have also given rise to over 150 water treaties around the world.Water-related disputes between states have typically been resolved through diplomatic channels; however, the past will not necessarily be a good predictor of the future, as climate change will increasingly amplify existing water challenges at the local, national, regional and global levels.Still, diplomatic engagement can be a tool for addressing water, peace and security challenges. Canadian diplomatic and development efforts focus on reducing instability and the human tragedy posed by climate change, including through reducing risks and increasing resiliency with respect to natural disasters, forced migration, food insecurity and water scarcity.We also believe that women should be at the forefront of our interventions addressing these issues, and we ensure that Canada’s initiatives systematically integrate gender.IPS: The threat of sea level rise, caused by climate change, could also result in a new category of “environmental refugees” fleeing from their sinking homelands to neighboring countries. Shouldn’t the 1951 UN convention be amended to include this new category of refugees?MINISTER McKENNA: Decisions on actions the Government of Canada may take in the event of natural disasters are taken on a case-by-case basis.For refugees resettled from abroad, Canada relies on referrals from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) or another designated referral organization, or a private sponsorship group.Generally speaking, in order to be considered for resettlement to Canada, individuals must be a Convention refugee as defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.A Convention refugee is “a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons or race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries or (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.For questions on amending a UN convention, please contact UNHCR directly.IPS: How is Canada’s own environmental policies in relation to emissions, pollution, clean technology, renewable energy, marine conservation — and also its contribution to the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF)?”MINISTER McKENNA: The Pan-Canadian Framework (PCF) on Clean Growth and Climate Change is Canada’s plan to take ambitious action to fight climate change.The PCF is built on four pillars: 1) pricing carbon pollution, 2) complementary actions to reduce emissions across the economy, 3) adaptation and climate resilience and 4) clean technology, innovation, and jobs; and includes more than fifty concrete actions that cover all sectors of the Canadian economy.The PCF positions Canada to meet its Paris Agreement greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.Additional emissions reductions will come from measures that have not yet been modelled; including increases in carbon sequestered through forests and agricultural lands, investments in green infrastructure, public transit, and clean technology and innovation, as well as future actions by federal, provincial and territorial governments.In the PCF, Canada committed to become a global leader on clean technology innovation. The federal government has since announced $2.3 billion in clean technology investments, including nearly $1.4 billion in financing dedicated to supporting clean technology firms and $400 million to support the development and demonstration of clean technologies.Though 80% of Canada’s electricity already comes from non-emitting sources such as hydroelectricity, solar and wind, Canada has set a goal to increase this portion to 90% by 2030. In support of this goal, Canada has committed to invest $26.9 billion in green infrastructure, a portion of which will support renewable energy projects.Furthermore, Canada is working to reduce emissions from its existing fossil fuel fired electricity generation, passing final legislation in December 2018 that will phase-out traditional coal-fired electricity by 2030 and limit GHG emissions from natural gas-fired electricity generation.The writer can be contacted at thalifdeen@ips.orgIPS is an international communication institution with a global news agency at its core, raising the voices of the South and civil society on issues of development, globalisation, human rights and the environment Copyright © 2019 IPS-Inter Press Service.

Shouldn’t the 1951 UN convention be amended to include this new category of refugees?MINISTER McKENNA: Decisions on actions the Government of Canada may take in the event of natural disasters are taken on a case-by-case basis.For refugees resettled from abroad, Canada relies on referrals from the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) or another designated referral organization, or a private sponsorship group.Generally speaking, in order to be considered for resettlement to Canada, individuals must be a Convention refugee as defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.A Convention refugee is “a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons or race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of each of those countries or (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country.For questions on amending a UN convention, please contact UNHCR directly.IPS: How is Canada’s own environmental policies in relation to emissions, pollution, clean technology, renewable energy, marine conservation — and also its contribution to the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF)?”MINISTER McKENNA: The Pan-Canadian Framework (PCF) on Clean Growth and Climate Change is Canada’s plan to take ambitious action to fight climate change.The PCF is built on four pillars: 1) pricing carbon pollution, 2) complementary actions to reduce emissions across the economy, 3) adaptation and climate resilience and 4) clean technology, innovation, and jobs; and includes more than fifty concrete actions that cover all sectors of the Canadian economy.The PCF positions Canada to meet its Paris Agreement greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030.Additional emissions reductions will come from measures that have not yet been modelled; including increases in carbon sequestered through forests and agricultural lands, investments in green infrastructure, public transit, and clean technology and innovation, as well as future actions by federal, provincial and territorial governments.In the PCF, Canada committed to become a global leader on clean technology innovation. The federal government has since announced $2.3 billion in clean technology investments, including nearly $1.4 billion in financing dedicated to supporting clean technology firms and $400 million to support the development and demonstration of clean technologies.Though 80% of Canada’s electricity already comes from non-emitting sources such as hydroelectricity, solar and wind, Canada has set a goal to increase this portion to 90% by 2030. In support of this goal, Canada has committed to invest $26.9 billion in green infrastructure, a portion of which will support renewable energy projects.Furthermore, Canada is working to reduce emissions from its existing fossil fuel fired electricity generation, passing final legislation in December 2018 that will phase-out traditional coal-fired electricity by 2030 and limit GHG emissions from natural gas-fired electricity generation.The writer can be contacted at thalifdeen@ips.orgIPS is an international communication institution with a global news agency at its core, raising the voices of the South and civil society on issues of development, globalisation, human rights and the environment Copyright © 2019 IPS-Inter Press Service.

Allen in this opinion piece. Allen is head of the outreach and public affairs department of Agoda.com, the Asia-based subsidiary of Booking Holding. He also notes that several other waves of transformation are on the way.The advent and rapid expansion of the sharing economy are changing the accommodations industry. The avatar of this change, of course, is the rise of Airbnb, which has grown from a tiny San Francisco seedling called “Airbed and Breakfast” into a global player – but the change is much broader than that. A number of major short-term rental players now offer over a million listings each, and investments have been pouring in. The hotel industry has begun to innovate and adapt in response. Dozens, and probably hundreds, of ancillary companies are popping up (and sometimes popping down again), offering hosts and guests new services and new ways to travel. A few companies are experimenting with what Homelike co-founder Dustin Figge has called “living as a service.” These developments create opportunities (new business models, new companies, new jobs), difficulties (Schumpeter’s “creative destruction” at play), and challenges (how do governments manage, regulate, tax and extract benefits from accommodations that are alternatively residential and commercial?)Some embrace these developments; others are doing their best to ignore them or make them go away. But as Francis S. C. Yeoh, professorial fellow in entrepreneurship at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, notes, “It’s a big wave – a tsunami – that’s coming, and you have to recognize, acknowledge and manage it. It is futile to try and fight.” Rajeev Menon, Marriott’s COO for Asia Pacific (excluding Greater China), agrees: “This is a business model that’s here to stay.”As these changes continue – and even accelerate – the question many people are asking is “What will the future look like?”Our view: the sector will continue to grow, much more quickly than the traditional rental economy. Some of the hottest areas will be Asia, business travel and the millennial traveler. Business models will change, with hotels and short-term accommodations learning from one another; types of travel will blur. Ancillary industries will expand to fill the ecosystem, and with them employment will continue to change. And governments that look ahead and adapt to these developments will derive substantial benefits for their economies and their communities. Let’s explore.Accelerating GrowthThe sharing economy, including short-term accommodations, is growing fast. Already, Booking Homes (part of the Booking Holdings Group) has over 5.6 million listings in 227 countries, with an average of 1.5 million room nights booked daily; Airbnb has over 5 million listings in 191 countries, with 400 million cumulative guest arrivals; HomeAway over 2 million listings in 190 countries; Agoda (also part of Booking Holdings) has over 1.1 million properties; and Tujia has over 1 million listings in 300 Chinese cities and global locations.Travel industry experts Skift predicted in 2017 that total global revenues from the local host industry sector would reach US$169 billion by the end of 2018.  And executives at HomeAway’s 2017 annual summit estimated that the overall local host market was growing two to four times as fast as the global economy.  This growth will continue: HomeAway has also found that 82% of current users planned to stay in local host rentals again.Given this acceleration, it is hardly surprising that investors are flocking to the short-term rental sector; indeed, Andrew McConnell, CEO of property management marketplace Rented.com, described the market as a “gold rush.” In 2017 alone, Chinese players Tujia and Xiaozhu together attracted over $500 million in new funding from such investors as Ctrip.com International Ltd., Morningside Ventures, and Capital Today. Brookfield Property Partners put $200 million into an Airbnb joint venture with real estate developer Niido for the launch of “Niido Powered by Airbnb,” developments in which tenants may rent their units out for up to 180 days per year. Short-term capabilities, in other words, are being baked in to the long-term property market.Asia is an epicenter of the sharing economy. Nielsen research has found that the Asia-Pacific residents were the most willing in the world to participate in sharing, with 81% willing to rent or share others’ assets and 78% willing to rent or share their own (vs. global figures of 66% and 68%), and of the top 10 countries most likely to do so, four are in Asia: China, the Philippines, Thailand, and India. And with 135 million outbound travelers (UN World Tourism Organization), China is well positioned to influence global trends.Business Travel and MillennialsBusiness travelers spent $1.3 trillion in 2016, expanding at 6% to 7% annually, according to the Global Business Travel Association.  While business travel in local host rentals “is still in its infancy,” the trend is growing, according to Jeffrey Manheimer, co-founder of short-term rental aggregator Tripping.com. Both Booking.com and Airbnb now offer choices that are geared toward business travel (with such features as Wi-Fi, self-check-in and more flexible cancellation policies), and American Express Global Business Travel has already partnered with Airbnb to facilitate expensing. More and more people are combining business and leisure travel, a practice that bodes well for the short-term rental industry.This trend and others are particularly visible among the fast-growing segment of millennial travelers. Seven in 10 millennial business travelers want to stay in local host rentals because of the experience they provide, according to Condé Nast Traveler.A key factor in this change may in fact be millennials. “There are 1.2 billion of them around the world, more than half of whom are in Asia,” said Turochas “T” Fuad, managing director of WeWork Southeast Asia. “The millennials are doing things differently.” Indeed, a Hipmunk survey found that 44% of millennial travelers prefer local host rentals to hotels, and a survey by Expedia noted that 62% of millennials were willing to extend their travel after a business trip to experience local life. Millennial travel is differentiated in other ways, too: According to BCG, millennials plan ahead and travel for longer periods than older consumers; they look to aggregators, online travel agencies and metasearch engines for deals; and they rely heavily on peer recommendations and reviews. For companies that want to capture the millennial market, innovation is the name of the game. This market is not small: China alone is home to 400 million millennials, and a 2018 report by Forbes cited a study valuing the global millennial travel market at more than $200 billion.The environment matters, too. Citing research on consumer behavior by Nielsen and Deloitte, Credit Suisse has stated that millennials are “the most sustainability-conscious generation.”  They are heavily influenced by such trends as the move to “sharing instead of consuming” through peer-to-peer economies.  A 2017 TripAdvisor survey cited by the Chicago Tribune also noted that “nearly two-thirds of travelers plan to make more environmentally sound choices over the next year.” Shared accommodations can be greener than hotels because both guests and hosts tend to conserve resources more in a home setting than they do in hotels; because sharing gets more use out of existing assets; and because staying in residential neighborhoods balances traveler loads around cities more than staying in hotels typically does.Evolving Business ModelsIt is in the nature of business models to change. Sharing accommodations (think bed-and-breakfasts) are far from new, but the sector has grown very fast in the past couple of decades for two main reasons. One is the growth and change in demand, tied to the high cost of hotels in urban markets, the need for additional supply created by special events, family travel needs (especially laundry and kitchens). And the other, of course, is technology – the rise of online travel.“As the market evolves, short-term rentals and hotels are beginning to resemble one another.”Interestingly, as the market evolves, short-term rentals and hotels are beginning to resemble one another. As short-term rental services expand, customer demand is pushing them toward hotels, with greater standardization, easy check-in, and more whole-unit rentals (as opposed to bedrooms in an owner’s home). Errol Cooke, Agoda’s Global vice president of partner services, has noted, “Eventually it may be a handful of large, global brands that control the space – especially those with deep pockets for buyouts, marketing, and additional revenue streams like hotels, concierge service and communities.” The short-term market is commercializing.Conversely, hotels are already becoming more locally focused. Hyatt Hotels CEO Mark Hoplamazian has credited services like Airbnb for making the Hyatt brand stronger. “Airbnb has demonstrated that people really do care about the interpersonal human experience,” he said. Airbnb has “actually expanded travel, and they’ve inspired us to think about how we do business.” Hilton is developing “locally curated” hotels; YOTEL Singapore offers self-service check-in and communal work and leisure spaces. Ianic Menard, Accor Hotels’ vice president of sales, marketing and distribution for Upper Southeast Asia notes, “We have a new brand called JO&JOE, which helps travelers rent a small space that’s very affordable and is about meeting and making connections with locals.” Competition stimulates innovation; each side is learning from the other.Vacation rentals cannot compete with five-star hotels in every area, but an ecosystem of ancillary services is emerging; it replicates, and in some cases even expands upon, the hotel model. Some of the more intriguing new services include LuggageHero, a baggage storage service; Cleanly (dry cleaning and laundry); Drizly, a beer, wine, and liquor delivery app; Zeel (same-day massages and spa treatments);  Glamsquad (beauty services); Handstand (bike routes and appointments with local trainers); and Helpr, which provides screened childcare providers within three hours’ notice. And while these services may have been designed with vacation rentals in mind, they work for hotels, too. In some cases, they may displace captive offerings (e.g., food delivery apps replacing room service), but in others they allow hotels to offer outsourced services they might otherwise not have provided at all. The hotel model will continue to be disaggregated and reconfigured.The concept of shared space is altering other parts of life, as well. Korea has had “officetels” (urban buildings with both “office” and “hotel” features) since the mid-1980s, but this concept is expanding at a much more rapid space through the exceptional growth of WeWork. Launched in 2010 to provide flexible office space with millennial-friendly features (e.g., communal spaces; free beer and coffee), WeWork is growing fast around the world, and is itself evolving. Their new WeLive product, for example, offers buildings whose residents can participate in communal meals, movie nights and yoga classes – as well as internet and cable access, and monthly cleaning services. In May 2017, the company announced WeWork Wellness, with communal gym classes. Six months later, news surfaced about WeGrow – grade schools in WeWork buildings, with a mix of traditional instruction and business-oriented topics. “Products change; needs change,” says Fuad, in what could be a mantra for the sharing economy as a whole. “We’re filling the void of what people are looking for.”“Health care benefits and retirement plans are not generally designed for the gig economy, and the answer cannot be to force gig workers to live without them.”One of the problematic features about real estate, as it has traditionally been managed, is that it is “lumpy” – and the lumps are quite large. Residential leases run for a minimum of a year, commercial leases for three to five years or even more. Given that businesses tend to grow and shrink, the overlay on leases is often quite ill-fitting, with companies forced to pay for space they do not need at some points, and to squeeze into insufficient quarters at others. The more flexible sharing economy model is far better suited to the ebb and flow of the business world. With this pattern in mind, AppearHere, a London-based startup, is trying to establish itself as “the Airbnb for retail.”Expect to see more of this kind of flexibility, both at home and at work, (though these terms may no longer be opposites). Rather than buying or signing leases for a specific residence or office, people will one day have membership options with companies that guarantee space in any of their facilities worldwide – timeshares for the twenty-first century. Co-living will expand beyond the new-agey environments of California’s East Bay and Silicon Valley, offering the opportunity for residents to create their own multi-generational, ever-changing families. Just as with bike-sharing and ride-sharing, the concept of ownership may increasingly give way – as the Boston Consulting Group has suggested – to the concept of “everything as a service” – a life in which assets become functions. The real estate market will move away from its current rigid structure to become increasingly life-like, increasingly organic.As we have noted, these changes do not come without disruption. The flip side of the sharing economy is the “gig economy,” in which permanent, full-time jobs are replaced – in whole or in part – by incidental or serial temporary roles. Such jobs provide major benefits to people at certain stages of their professional lives, but can be very difficult for others, as dramatized in particular by the ups and downs of services like Uber, which has had confrontations with taxi unions and labor laws in cities in both the U.S. and Asia. Health care benefits and retirement plans are not generally designed for the gig economy, and the answer cannot be to force gig workers to live without them.Similarly, the regulations designed for hotels, offices, and apartments do not apply readily nor easily to short-term rentals. The retiree who rents out a spare bedroom cannot be expected to meet the same licensing and registration requirements that a 500-room hotel would fulfil. But the alternatives (forbidding her to rent the space to supplement her modest income – and depriving her community of tax and business revenue – or forcing her to operate underground, without licensing or safety inspections) simply don’t work. Licensing and regulatory schemes need to adjust to the new reality – and they need to continue to be flexible, a quality not always associated with property laws.As with globalization, the changes brought by the sharing economy are new, complex, and often unpredictable. There will be winners and losers; and there will be tremendous need for adjustment. Some of the change will be painful at times. But the changes we have noted in travel patterns, in other aspects of real estate, and in how our lives are defined by space are very real. Overall, as the World Travel & Tourism Council has documented, the travel and tourism industries are responsible for about 10 percent of the world’s GDP and jobs, and the short-term accommodations segment represents a rapidly growing share of this market. These are vast economic domains, and the changes they are undergoing are powerful ones. The individuals, companies, and governments that adapt to them will capture their significant benefits, enhancing economies and lives.Fortune magazine editor Leigh Gallagher offers an inside look into the early days of Airbnb and its unlikely path to becoming a lodging giant, in her new book.Around the globe, governments are grappling with particular problems created by innovative sharing platforms like Uber and Airbnb.

All Rights ReservedThe husband of a Commonwealth Games athlete has been blacklisted by an anti-doping panel for allegedly supplying Meldonium – a banned substance that improves endurance – to the country’s top decathlete, 25-year-old Jagtar Singh.In a recent order, the Anti-Doping Appeal Panel blacklisted the unidentified athlete’s husband, Puneet, and another drug supplier, Sunny Malik, based on the findings of several anti-drug government agencies. The order banned the two from the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi and asked the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) to warn athletes about them.The panel’s order was based on information provided by Jagtar, who was a member of the Indian team for the Asian Athletics Championships in 2017 before his name was withdrawn after he tested positive for Meldonium. The banned substance gained notoriety worldwide three years ago in the dope case involving tennis star Maria Sharapova.“In view of the information disclosed by the athlete, we also direct NADA to blacklist and prohibit the entry of Mr Puneet and Mr Sunny Malik in Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi and any other stadium/facility where national or international sporting activity takes place,” stated the order by the panel, headed by senior advocate of the Supreme Court Vibha Datta Makhija.“We also direct NADA to issue appropriate and prominent warning to be affixed on notice boards/websites of NADA and all sporting stadiums/facilities warning athletes and other persons about the discovery of prohibited substances from Mr Puneet and Mr Sunny Malik and/or the risk of procuring any supplies from them,” it said.Last month, Jagtar got his doping ban reduced from four years to two after “providing substantial assistance” that helped authorities bust a chain of illegal performance-enhancing drugs suppliers that mostly operated around the Jawarharlal Nehru Stadium, the capital’s athletics hub. The panel’s report refers to Puneet’s wife as a “Commonwealth Games athlete”.According to Jagtar’s submission before the panel, Puneet was allegedly a regular supplement supplier at the stadium and had allegedly given him with “injectable substances” with labels in a foreign language (Russian).Based on information provided by Jagtar, drug inspectors of the Central Drugs and Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) and the Delhi government, and officers of NADA apprehended Malik from the Jungpura Metro station. They allegedly recovered prohibited substances, including testosterone, an anabolic steroid.In 2016, Sharapova was banned for two years after testing positive for Meldonium, a drug largely manufactured in Latvia and distributed in Baltic countries and Russia. The World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) added Meldonium to its prohibited list in January 1, 2016.For long, there have been whispers in track-and-field circles that some Indian athletes who train abroad act as carriers of banned drugs and sell it to others with a help of a syndicate.Jagtar’s lawyer said the decathlete had gone out of the way to help drug control officers curb the menace of illegal substances. “No athlete in India has ever gone this far to assist NADA in discovering and bringing forward an offence under the laws of India. NADA must encourage athletes to come forward and provide assistance to them,” said Parth Goswami of the law firm Phalpher and Goswami.The anti-doping panel order, dated January 30, 2019, highlighted the potential risk Jagtar and NADA officials faced when trying to curb suppliers of illegal substances to athletes.“…the appellant and the NADA officials associated with investigation were roughed up and threatened by the alleged accused and their associates. The information provided by the athlete has certainly led to discovery of a criminal offence… as also the discovery of a very important source of illegal/unlicensed supply of prohibited substances to athletes at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, New Delhi,” the order stated.Download the Indian Express apps for iPhone, iPad or Android© 2019 The Indian Express Ltd.

17,Student Loan Debt,Should Student Loan Debt Be Easier to Discharge in Bankruptcy?,1s17q6r,https://blog.credit.com/2015/03/reason-student-loans-dischargeable-in-bankruptcy-111702/,The Real Reason Student Loans Should Be Dischargeable in Bankruptcy | Credit.com,"Home > Student Loans > The Real Reason Student Loans Should Be Dischargeable in BankruptcyLexington Law offers services to dispute unfair negative items. Call for a FREE consultation:President Obama got people thinking when he raised the possibility of discharging certain education loans in bankruptcy within the context of the executive action he signed last week — the one that’s intended to ensure unfettered access to government-sponsored relief programs and a means for registering complaints about unfair treatment.Not to be outdone, 13 U.S. Senators introduced the Fairness for Struggling Students Act of 2015 just two days later. Their bill proposes to place private student loans on equal, bankruptcy-eligible footing with other consumer debts; in particular, those that are similarly uncollateralized.The problem is, none of this will mean very much.Private student loans represent roughly 10% of all student debt, and less than 10% of those loans are actually in default. So even if every defaulting borrower were to end up in bankruptcy court, neither measure would address more than 1% of the whole.Get It Now Privacy PolicySo why not acknowledge the obvious and dispense with the artificial distinction between federal and private student loans in this matter?Because bankruptcy is a four-letter word in our culture. To most, it represents abject failure—the white flag of surrender. To others, it’s tantamount to amnesty — a deceitful ploy to avoid having to pay for a mistake.Yet why do we seem to be able to rationalize the discharge of mortgage, auto and credit card debts more than for education loans? Is it because many of us have managed to meet our own obligations? Or could it have something to do with the way we’ve learned to regard this category of debt?The exclusion of student loans from bankruptcy dates to the mid-1970s when – following years of disparaging stories about students who were allegedly “defaulting on purpose” as a passive-aggressive means of expressing their anti-government sentiments – generational gap-driven emotions trumped reason and 11 USC 523(a)(8) came into effect.Having taken out my first student loans around that time, I recall the stories and the strong reactions they elicited—both on and off-campus, as my friends and I worried the program would be discontinued. But I also remember that those same inflammatory news reports were later discredited. Unfortunately, the damage was already done. The notion of “elitist,” “ungrateful” young borrowers became a part of the narrative, inspiring additional restrictions in subsequent years that culminated in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 — legislation that granted the same exception to private student loans. (A good chronology of the various legislative actions can be found here.)To be fair, though, it’s not as if education-loan borrowers didn’t get anything out of the deal. After all, it costs a lot more to carry a credit card balance despite the fact that both types of debt are equally unsecured. The $1.2 trillion question, however, is this: Does a lower interest rate justify the student-loan borrower’s demotion to second-class citizenship?Consider what would happen if the bankruptcy exception were repealed.Lenders would be motivated to negotiate sustainable, longer-term accommodations with borrowers who are on the brink because, as the saying goes, “A rolling loan gathers no loss.” So, too, would the schools come under pressure to reduce tuition rates because reasonably priced financing will become that much harder to attain.Still, the idea of making education-related debts eligible for discharge is worrisome, given the potential impact on our taxpayer-supported system of finance. All the more reason to act now to head off that risk.Get It Now Privacy PolicyIt doesn’t take a whole lot of lending experience to realize that when roughly half of all the loans in your portfolio require some form of accommodation to facilitate repayment, it’s obvious the remittance schedules were improperly designed at the outset.These loans – all of them – need to be restructured for terms of up to 20 years without consideration for the entity that originated the contract (public versus private sector), payment status (current, past-due or in default), or subjecting borrowers to annual re-qualification. (I read that 40% of income-based repayment participants fail to file the necessary forms on time.) Debtors should also have the right to accelerate repayment without penalty so they may save on interest.Not only should we do this now, but we can well afford it, too.There is more than enough spread between what the government pays for the money it borrows to fund these loans and the interest rates and fees it charges to students and parents. Couple that with tighter controls over the loan servicing and debt collection processes and bankruptcy will once again be viewed the way it was originally intended: as a last resort.This story is an Op/Ed contribution to Credit.com and does not necessarily represent the views of the company or its partners.Image: iStockOne in Five Americans Are Shocked to Find Errors on Their Credit ReportCredit report mistakes can lead to disqualification for mortgages and car loans, as well as increased insurance premiums and interest rates.

We also employ a few freelancers and more than 50 contributors (these are typically subject matter experts from the worlds of finance, academia, politics, business and elsewhere). Our Reporting We take great pains to ensure that the articles, video and graphics you see on Credit.com are thoroughly reported and fact-checked. Each story is read by two separate editors, and we adhere to the highest editorial standards.

Our Business Model Credit.com’s journalism is largely supported by an e-commerce business model. Rather than rely on revenue from display ad impressions, Credit.com maintains a financial marketplace separate from its editorial pages. When someone navigates to those pages, and applies for a credit card, for example, Credit.com will get paid what is essentially a finder’s fee if that person ends up getting the card. That doesn’t mean, however, that our editorial decisions are informed by the products available in our marketplace. The editorial team chooses what to write about and how to write about it independently of the decisions and priorities of the business side of the company.

Again, this tool is entirely free, and we mention that frequently in our articles, because we think that it’s a good thing for users to have access to data like this. Separate from its educational value, there is also a business angle to the Credit Report Card. Registered users can be matched with products and services for which they are most likely to qualify. In other words, if you register and you find that your credit is less than stellar, Credit.com won’t recommend a high-end platinum credit card that requires an excellent credit score You’d likely get rejected, and that’s no good for you or Credit.com.

2,Euthanasia & Assisted Suicide,Should Euthanasia or Physician-Assisted Suicide Be Legal?,2s2q7r,https://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2019/02/10/physician-assisted-suicide-nj-death-with-dignity-bill/2829948002/,"NJ legislators, residents should oppose assisted suicide bill: Flatow","Have an existing account?Already have a subscription?Don't have an account?Get the newsLet friends in your social network know what you are reading aboutThere are many non-theistic reasons for opposing New Jersey's physician assisted suicide bill.A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guideline Testimony from an opponent and supporter at a Statehouse hearing on Feb. 7, 2019 about an NJ bill to let terminally ill patients end their own lives. Nicholas Pugliese, State House Bureau, @nickpugzI empathize with every advocate of physician assisted suicide (PAS), because I, too, have lost loved ones to the ravages of cancer.  But we all have to take a step back from our personal stories that may be driving the push to legally approve PAS and look at the immediate and long-term effects of it on all of society.I am not a priest, minister or rabbi who might oppose PAS on religious grounds, or a physician who opposes it based on taking the Hippocratic Oath. But supporters of PAS have to admit there are non-theistic reasons for opposing it.Civilized societies throughout history have not and do not approve of suicide.  Disapproval of suicide has been one of civilized society’s pillars throughout the millennia.NJ Senate committee advances medically assisted death billWhat you should know as medically assisted death bill advances in NJOn death with dignity and final things: LowryAdvocates of PAS put forward the prospect of uncontrollable pain as a straw man.  Do they believe that death is the ultimate pain reliever? In truth, in medical practice today, pain relief is almost always possible given the drugs available and the medical specialty of pain management. Since pain can be alleviated, there is no basis to assert a need for PAS because of intractable pain. It’s the fear of intolerable pain that is driving requests for PAS, not pain itself.Death with Dignity Act (Photo: Getty Images)Perhaps the most articulate opposition to PAS is found in the report of the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law. The report notes the following concerns: The pressures patients would feel, from their doctors and their families, to opt for suicide; the inherent inequalities of our health care delivery systems which tend to discriminate against the poor, the handicapped and the elderly; the psychological vulnerability of the severely ill; the risk of misdiagnoses of the patient’s condition; the likelihood in many cases that adequate treatment of pain and depression would dissuade the patient from seeking death.”And then there’s the slippery slope argument: If PAS is made legal, then other things will follow, ending in the legalization of euthanasia for anyone for any reason or no reason. The Netherlands is one example of how the slippery slope works.In the 1980s the Dutch government stopped prosecuting physicians who practiced PAS, who committed voluntary euthanasia on their patients. But by the 1990s a government-requested study found that more than 50 percent of acts of euthanasia were no longer voluntary. In 2001 euthanasia was made legal. And in 2004 it was decided that children also could be euthanized.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guideline Testimony from an opponent and supporter at a Statehouse hearing on Feb. 7, 2019 about an NJ bill to let terminally ill patients end their own lives. Nicholas Pugliese, State House Bureau, @nickpugzI empathize with every advocate of physician assisted suicide (PAS), because I, too, have lost loved ones to the ravages of cancer.  But we all have to take a step back from our personal stories that may be driving the push to legally approve PAS and look at the immediate and long-term effects of it on all of society.I am not a priest, minister or rabbi who might oppose PAS on religious grounds, or a physician who opposes it based on taking the Hippocratic Oath. But supporters of PAS have to admit there are non-theistic reasons for opposing it.Civilized societies throughout history have not and do not approve of suicide.  Disapproval of suicide has been one of civilized society’s pillars throughout the millennia.NJ Senate committee advances medically assisted death billWhat you should know as medically assisted death bill advances in NJOn death with dignity and final things: LowryAdvocates of PAS put forward the prospect of uncontrollable pain as a straw man.  Do they believe that death is the ultimate pain reliever? In truth, in medical practice today, pain relief is almost always possible given the drugs available and the medical specialty of pain management. Since pain can be alleviated, there is no basis to assert a need for PAS because of intractable pain. It’s the fear of intolerable pain that is driving requests for PAS, not pain itself.Death with Dignity Act (Photo: Getty Images)Perhaps the most articulate opposition to PAS is found in the report of the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law. The report notes the following concerns: The pressures patients would feel, from their doctors and their families, to opt for suicide; the inherent inequalities of our health care delivery systems which tend to discriminate against the poor, the handicapped and the elderly; the psychological vulnerability of the severely ill; the risk of misdiagnoses of the patient’s condition; the likelihood in many cases that adequate treatment of pain and depression would dissuade the patient from seeking death.”And then there’s the slippery slope argument: If PAS is made legal, then other things will follow, ending in the legalization of euthanasia for anyone for any reason or no reason. The Netherlands is one example of how the slippery slope works.In the 1980s the Dutch government stopped prosecuting physicians who practiced PAS, who committed voluntary euthanasia on their patients. But by the 1990s a government-requested study found that more than 50 percent of acts of euthanasia were no longer voluntary. In 2001 euthanasia was made legal. And in 2004 it was decided that children also could be euthanized.

Photo: Wikimedia Commons.Israelis who believe in a two-state solution argue that Israel cannot annex the West Bank because it will result in Palestinians forming a significant minority — if not a majority — of the population. If those Palestinians are given the right to vote, Israel will no longer be a Jewish state, and if they are denied that right, Israel will cease to be a democracy. Therefore, a peace agreement must be negotiated that will give the Palestinians a state.Israeli one-staters believe that the Jewish population will grow through natural increase and immigration to the point where a “Greater Israel” can remain Jewish and democratic. The demography, however, makes both positions untenable.Consider the idea of annexation. Setting aside the fact that Palestinians object to Israeli rule and that the Palestinians would become an internal security threat, the demographic dilemma is unavoidable. Though some non-demographers present data they claim shows there is no threat to the Jewish majority, most demographers see things differently.The total population of Israel as of January 1, 2019 was 8,972,000. The good news for Israel is that this represents a 10-fold increase compared to 1948. The bad news is that the percentage of Israel’s population that is Jewish has been declining. It went from a high of nearly 90 percent in the 1950s and early 1960s to just 74 percent today. France teeters on the edge of financial bankruptcy. To bring some money into the nation’s coffers, French authorities sometimes compromise...The one-staters have argued that Israel’s demographic challenge would be offset by mass immigration, but even after the influx of more than one million Jews from the former Soviet Union, the Jewish proportion of the population continued to fall.Some pin their hopes on a new influx from Europe as a consequence of the surge in antisemitism; however, even if every Jew emigrated from the EU, the population would only grow by half a million. And they’re not leaving in large numbers. The total number of immigrants to Israel was approximately 30,000 in 2018, and only a few thousand came from Europe. The largest number, 2,660, came from France, a decline of 25 percent from the year before, despite a 74 percent increase in French antisemitic incidents in 2018. Furthermore, many of the Europeans who immigrated in the past returned to their original homes.The people who place their faith in immigration to maintain a Jewish majority have another problem; last year, 60 percent of all olim were not Halachically Jewish.Now consider the addition of the Palestinian population from the West Bank, which, according to the CIA’s World Factbook, is approximately 2.8 million. Nearly 1.9 million Arabs are Israeli citizens. Annexation would bring the Arab population of Israel to 4.7 million, or approximately 40 percent. Given the growth of the Palestinian population, even at the lower birthrate of today, some demographers expect that figure to exceed 50 percent.One-staters often argue the Palestinian statistics are inflated, but even if they were off by one million, the Palestinian proportion of the population would be more than 30 percent. Also consider that the third largest party in the last Knesset was the Arab List. It still did not have the numbers to affect policy, but will that change if the Arab population grows from 20 percent to 30 percent or more? Moreover, the majority of the current Arab population has accepted the Jewish character of the state, but the Palestinians in the West Bank do not. They are not likely to show the same loyalty that Arab citizens have shown for the last 70 years.Even Israel’s right-wing prime ministers have recognized the demographic dilemma. Begin, Shamir, or Sharon could have announced the immediate annexation of the West Bank, but none did. Netanyahu has also resisted calls from his coalition partners to move in this direction. Furthermore, Sharon and Netanyahu actually agreed to withdrawals from parts of the West Bank.The two-staters, as well as the Palestinians, complain of creeping annexation. Even though the Palestinian Authority controls roughly 40 percent of the West Bank, both the growth of the number of settlers and their location makes the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state increasingly unlikely, if not already impossible. This, of course, is the intent of the one-staters who promote the settlements.Had the Palestinians agreed to peace at any time in the last 51 years, the spread of settlements would have stopped. Begin offered them autonomy when the number of settlers was less than 12,000. If the Palestinians had fulfilled their Oslo obligations, the number would have been frozen at roughly 170,000. Arafat rejected Barak’s 2000 offer of 97 percent of the West Bank at a time when there were 200,000 settlers. If they had accepted a similar deal Olmert proposed in 2006, the figure would be 260,000. Thanks to their irredentism, the current Jewish population of the West Bank is nearly 450,000. The number will only grow with each passing year that the Palestinians refuse to negotiate. Twenty years from now, the population is expected to grow to nearly one million.Most peace plans assume that Israel would annex sufficient territory to incorporate most of the Jews currently living in the West Bank. At Camp David, Israel insisted that 80 percent of the Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria would be in settlement blocs under Israeli sovereignty. In 2000, most Jews lived in the five “consensus” blocs, but even then, the number outside of those blocs would have been difficult if not impossible to relocate.Based on current data, the situation has gotten much more complicated. Today, approximately 250,000 Jews live in the blocs, which is roughly 58 percent of the estimated 450,000 Jews living in Judea and Samaria. The two-staters’ expectation has been that roughly one-third of the Jews living in other settlements will move into these blocs, which would raise the percentage close to 70 percent. The problem is that would still require Israel to evacuate more than 135,000 people.The likelihood of such a step, already low, became infinitesimal following the 2005 evacuation of Gaza. Israel’s disengagement required the removal of only about 9,000 people and that was a gut-wrenching experience for the nation. It is unimaginable that thousands of Israeli soldiers would be deployed to remove the nearly 200,000 Jews outside the blocs (assuming none voluntarily moved inside them).Even if most Jews left without a fight, as they did from Gaza, they would expect to be compensated more than the Gaza settlers. The cost would be astronomical. Israel could not afford to do it without US or international help, and because of the disdain for settlements, such assistance is unlikely.Perhaps most importantly, Israelis saw that instead of trading land for peace, the disengagement brought them thousands of rockets. This shifted Israeli opinion to the right and all but destroyed the peace camp. Today, no Israeli government would make territorial concessions without ironclad security guarantees that the West Bank will not become another Hamastan, and the base for terrorist attacks that could threaten its capital, its airport, its industrial heartland, and most of its population. It is hard to imagine how the Palestinians could convince Israelis to take such risks for peace given their words and deeds (e.g., the pay-to-slay policy of providing money to terrorists and their families).Unless an Israeli leader comes to power who is willing to freeze settlements over the long term, and it is difficult to see anyone doing so without dramatic changes on the Palestinian side, the settlement population will continue to grow. Given the distribution of the 131 settlements now in the West Bank, it would take a feat of geographic legerdemain to carve out a Palestinian state beyond the current borders of the Palestinian Authority (Area A). If that were satisfactory to the Palestinians, then a two-state solution might still be possible. It is clearly not acceptable, however, to any foreseeable Palestinian leader.Oh, and there is also the small matter of the Gaza Strip. The Strip is seen as an albatross not only by Israel, but by Egypt, which doesn’t want the headache of absorbing 1.8 million Palestinians.The one-staters don’t have much to say about Gaza. Israelis have no interest in returning, as evidenced by their willingness to tolerate a certain level of terror emanating from the area. They appear content with the status quo so long as violence does not escalate.The two-staters foresee a land bridge connecting Gaza and the West Bank; however, that assumes the Palestinians can agree among themselves on a future government. If a Palestinian leader took power in the West Bank who would be amenable to peace with Israel, they still could not make an agreement without Gaza. But so long as Hamas remains in power, and committed to Israel’s destruction, no deal is possible. Fatah would have to seize control of Gaza to have the authority to negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians, and thereby risk their own civil war. It is also possible that Hamas will succeed in its effort to subvert their rivals and takeover the West Bank.The future is uncertain, but today no “solution” is on the horizon.

Furthermore, many of the Europeans who immigrated in the past returned to their original homes.The people who place their faith in immigration to maintain a Jewish majority have another problem; last year, 60 percent of all olim were not Halachically Jewish.Now consider the addition of the Palestinian population from the West Bank, which, according to the CIA’s World Factbook, is approximately 2.8 million. Nearly 1.9 million Arabs are Israeli citizens. Annexation would bring the Arab population of Israel to 4.7 million, or approximately 40 percent. Given the growth of the Palestinian population, even at the lower birthrate of today, some demographers expect that figure to exceed 50 percent.One-staters often argue the Palestinian statistics are inflated, but even if they were off by one million, the Palestinian proportion of the population would be more than 30 percent. Also consider that the third largest party in the last Knesset was the Arab List. It still did not have the numbers to affect policy, but will that change if the Arab population grows from 20 percent to 30 percent or more? Moreover, the majority of the current Arab population has accepted the Jewish character of the state, but the Palestinians in the West Bank do not. They are not likely to show the same loyalty that Arab citizens have shown for the last 70 years.Even Israel’s right-wing prime ministers have recognized the demographic dilemma. Begin, Shamir, or Sharon could have announced the immediate annexation of the West Bank, but none did. Netanyahu has also resisted calls from his coalition partners to move in this direction. Furthermore, Sharon and Netanyahu actually agreed to withdrawals from parts of the West Bank.The two-staters, as well as the Palestinians, complain of creeping annexation. Even though the Palestinian Authority controls roughly 40 percent of the West Bank, both the growth of the number of settlers and their location makes the creation of a contiguous Palestinian state increasingly unlikely, if not already impossible. This, of course, is the intent of the one-staters who promote the settlements.Had the Palestinians agreed to peace at any time in the last 51 years, the spread of settlements would have stopped. Begin offered them autonomy when the number of settlers was less than 12,000. If the Palestinians had fulfilled their Oslo obligations, the number would have been frozen at roughly 170,000. Arafat rejected Barak’s 2000 offer of 97 percent of the West Bank at a time when there were 200,000 settlers. If they had accepted a similar deal Olmert proposed in 2006, the figure would be 260,000. Thanks to their irredentism, the current Jewish population of the West Bank is nearly 450,000. The number will only grow with each passing year that the Palestinians refuse to negotiate. Twenty years from now, the population is expected to grow to nearly one million.Most peace plans assume that Israel would annex sufficient territory to incorporate most of the Jews currently living in the West Bank. At Camp David, Israel insisted that 80 percent of the Jewish residents of Judea and Samaria would be in settlement blocs under Israeli sovereignty. In 2000, most Jews lived in the five “consensus” blocs, but even then, the number outside of those blocs would have been difficult if not impossible to relocate.Based on current data, the situation has gotten much more complicated. Today, approximately 250,000 Jews live in the blocs, which is roughly 58 percent of the estimated 450,000 Jews living in Judea and Samaria. The two-staters’ expectation has been that roughly one-third of the Jews living in other settlements will move into these blocs, which would raise the percentage close to 70 percent. The problem is that would still require Israel to evacuate more than 135,000 people.The likelihood of such a step, already low, became infinitesimal following the 2005 evacuation of Gaza. Israel’s disengagement required the removal of only about 9,000 people and that was a gut-wrenching experience for the nation. It is unimaginable that thousands of Israeli soldiers would be deployed to remove the nearly 200,000 Jews outside the blocs (assuming none voluntarily moved inside them).Even if most Jews left without a fight, as they did from Gaza, they would expect to be compensated more than the Gaza settlers. The cost would be astronomical. Israel could not afford to do it without US or international help, and because of the disdain for settlements, such assistance is unlikely.Perhaps most importantly, Israelis saw that instead of trading land for peace, the disengagement brought them thousands of rockets. This shifted Israeli opinion to the right and all but destroyed the peace camp. Today, no Israeli government would make territorial concessions without ironclad security guarantees that the West Bank will not become another Hamastan, and the base for terrorist attacks that could threaten its capital, its airport, its industrial heartland, and most of its population. It is hard to imagine how the Palestinians could convince Israelis to take such risks for peace given their words and deeds (e.g., the pay-to-slay policy of providing money to terrorists and their families).Unless an Israeli leader comes to power who is willing to freeze settlements over the long term, and it is difficult to see anyone doing so without dramatic changes on the Palestinian side, the settlement population will continue to grow. Given the distribution of the 131 settlements now in the West Bank, it would take a feat of geographic legerdemain to carve out a Palestinian state beyond the current borders of the Palestinian Authority (Area A). If that were satisfactory to the Palestinians, then a two-state solution might still be possible. It is clearly not acceptable, however, to any foreseeable Palestinian leader.Oh, and there is also the small matter of the Gaza Strip. The Strip is seen as an albatross not only by Israel, but by Egypt, which doesn’t want the headache of absorbing 1.8 million Palestinians.The one-staters don’t have much to say about Gaza. Israelis have no interest in returning, as evidenced by their willingness to tolerate a certain level of terror emanating from the area. They appear content with the status quo so long as violence does not escalate.The two-staters foresee a land bridge connecting Gaza and the West Bank; however, that assumes the Palestinians can agree among themselves on a future government. If a Palestinian leader took power in the West Bank who would be amenable to peace with Israel, they still could not make an agreement without Gaza. But so long as Hamas remains in power, and committed to Israel’s destruction, no deal is possible. Fatah would have to seize control of Gaza to have the authority to negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians, and thereby risk their own civil war. It is also possible that Hamas will succeed in its effort to subvert their rivals and takeover the West Bank.The future is uncertain, but today no “solution” is on the horizon. Hence, Palestinians and Israelis are left with a no-state non-solution.Mitchell Bard is the Executive Director of AICE and Jewish Virtual Library.Get our exclusive daily news briefing.get the best of the algemeiner straight to your inbox!",1603,1568
21,Drinking Age - Lower It,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?,1s21q9r,https://wqad.com/2014/07/16/should-the-u-s-lower-its-drinking-age/,Should the U.S. lower its drinking age? | WQAD.com,"Editor’s note: This story is part of a series on the 30th anniversary of the National Minimum Age Drinking Act, passed by Congress on July 17, 1984.(CNN) — Dwight B. Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people.When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6.No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals.By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision.Related: Experts say legal ages to drive, and to drink, should be switched“In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.”Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states — and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 — that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age — or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries — Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others — with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.“I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.“The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.”MADD about underage drinkingTwo generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 — or owning an ID that says you are — to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer?By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol — effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 — a bigger decline than for older age groups.“Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year, while MADD calls the legislation “one of the nation’s most important and lifesaving laws.”A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury.The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age.A stalled movementThere’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president.Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.”“Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week.“It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.”Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere.“We missed our moment,” he said.Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far.Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18.“There isn’t much appetite to change something that appears to be working,” said Martinic of ICAP. “It’s not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It’s pretty much a no go.”But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government.And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit — not unlike a driver’s license — upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.Do you think the drinking age in the U.S. should be lowered? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.Trademark and Copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But then all 50 states raised it again to 21 when Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act — for fear of losing a portion of federal highway money. But does a uniform drinking age of 21 work? Should the drinking age be lowered? Room for Debate asks the same question in “You Must Be 21 to Drink.” Gabrielle Glaser, the author of “Her Best-Kept Secret: Why Women Drink — and How They Can Regain Control,” writes in favor of returning the drinking age to 18: Return the drinking age to 18 — and then enforce the law. The current system, which forbids alcohol to Americans under 21, is widely flouted, with disastrous consequences. Teaching people to drink responsibly before they turn 21 would enormously enhance public health. Now, high school and college kids view dangerous binge drinking as a rite of passage.The current law, passed in all 50 states in the 1980s, was intended to diminish the number of traffic deaths caused by young drunk drivers. It has succeeded in that — but tougher seatbelt and D.U.I. rules have contributed to the decrease, too. Raising the drinking age hasn’t reduced drinking — it’s merely driven it underground, to the riskiest of settings: unsupervised high school blowouts and fraternity parties that make “Animal House” look quaint. This age segregation leads the drinking away from adults, who could model moderation. The roots of this extreme drinking lie in our own history. Prohibition, which banned most alcohol in the United States from 1920 to 1933, normalized the frenzied sort of drinking that occurs today at college parties. In speakeasies and blind pigs, the goal was to drink as much and as soon as possible, because you never knew when the feds would show up. Today’s law, likewise, encourages young people to dodge the system. Like Prohibition — and abstinence-only sex education — it’s been a dismal failure. Tamika C. B. Zapolski, an assistant professor of psychology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, argues in favor of keeping the drinking age high:Alcohol use in the United States is a serious public health concern, particularly among teenagers and young adults.Recent results from a national survey found that by eighth grade, approximately 27 percent had used alcohol, which increased to 66 percent by 12th grade. Additionally, a second national survey indicated that among high school seniors, about 20 percent binge drank, consuming more than 5 drinks in one occasion, during the two-week period preceding the survey. Heavy drinking is associated with negative social, mental and physical health outcomes — including risk of violent behavior, sexual assault, accidents that cause injury, additional drug use, poor academics, legal troubles, and family and interpersonal problems. Those most likely to experience harm from heavy drinking are young people, particularly those of college age.Thus lowering the drinking age would be harmful in two ways. First, young people, those most likely to be harmed from drinking, will have greater access to alcohol. Second, lowering the drinking age may lead to lowered perception of risk. When perception of risk from a particular substance decreases, prevalence rates tend to increase. Students: Read the Room for Debate feature, then tell us …— Should the drinking age be lowered? Why?— Does a higher drinking age encourage binge drinking, as alcohol is now forbidden for young people under 21?— If Americans are old enough to vote and join the military at the age of 18, should they be allowed to decide if they want to drink?— Or do you think alcohol is such a dangerous substance, especially when abused, that it should continue to be prohibited for those under 21? And does keeping a high drinking age save lives by decreasing drunken-driving fatalities?— Would lowering the drinking age send the wrong signal to young people, that drinking is not inherently risky?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name.Comments are no longer being accepted.I agree with the law of U.S.A is correctly because is for protection by all citizen of the country, because sometimes the young people specific under 21 years no have a lot responsabilities and no thinking in others when they drink, and cause accidents fatalities for people innocent.It is dangerous drink a lot alcohol, this is clear but that situation have long time, must the young people like to drink, people around the world drink before 18 year. if you love yourself don’t abuse to anything in the life. ” health body is health life” so be careful.due to favorable benefits has had the law not to allow the youth of 18 -19 to consume alcoholic beverages for security reasons both health and prevention in terms of accidents or Automobile sales intoxication ,I’m totally agree with the law not to allow alcohol to under 21.I’m totally agree that the law continue preventing alcohol exes.The should the drinking age can not be lowered. Because some time people the 18 age don’t have control when take alcohol. and have a bat behaviorI consider young people it is more dangerous to drink under 21 years. Because drink a lot of its considered a negative social include violent and addiction .I agree in unite state drink in public is considered a health concern than other country’s. people under 21 need way to be a 21 years for can drinks . Who drinks before 21 has a penalty for broken the roles.I think alcohol for age lowered is bad and dangerous because teenager don’t have a control when drink almost teenager drive because have permission for the families but sometime teenager drink alcohol and driving with alcohol and but this some accident in the road . teenager can not use alcohol because they can control when their drink… is better if they have 21 because they are responsible because I agree with the new rule of new York state .I agree that idea, because the teenagers think they have the control on everything. If in this country law was lowered drinking age will happen more accident. A good example is happening in Spain. Most students from many countries go to Spain because there is lowered drinking age 18. But the people who are living there complain all time about this situation,.I thing the young people should be more aware drinking is not a game and must wait for the right age to drink alcohol without hurry. perhaps should also expect the age of 21 for young peoples can join the military force or army so they do no feel entitled to take drinking earlyI agree what not can drink because the teenagers can’t measure the consequents about the alcohol in they brain and body not could react in a situation. Each person is conscious is aware of what makes not matter if is under 21 or not whe a person want drink , but is good always create awareness about the consequents the drink alcohol. In USA the teenagers are minor only for drink , whe needs some people for military in this moment anyone is under 21.l think young under 21 shouldn’t’ drink because sometimes they don’t see the consequences , more accident can happen for example: I was 18 I had different mind ,different opinion is ok when you are 21 you decide to go military service but alcohol is dangerous subtanceI agree with this article because the drinking age it should be lowered. Many young people drink and drive so that can be impossible, they can have an accident. They can drink when they return 21, but moderately and not drive when they are drinking. You can have fun without the alcohol.About the article I think is dangerous, because they are not prepared. I think the effects to be bad and they will have no control over what might happen and would not be good for health. I think at 21 years themselves can be responsible for their actionsIn my opinion wee see the big problem about the binge drinking in the teenager ,when you are teenager your bobby make changes ,if you drink your brain not going to work ,in my opinion alcohol it’s a big problem today because we have to much commercial in the TV about alcohol that’s make change in the mentality of the teenager that’s why we have to much alcoholic people today for resolve this problem the authority need to take care about this.I disagree that the age be lowered, they can to continue to be prohibited for those under 21 or more because some of them are 21 years old but aren’t mature and irresponsible, in the stores they can to forbid the sale of more than one bottle of alcohol for each one.think the age for alcohol consumption should not be reduced because young people are less likely to develop disruptive behavior due to alcohol include excessive drinking, can see that while younger are more young people are eceden to drink more alcohol and their behavior has to have more impact on the health and safety of young himself, including damage to his conduct, risk of death and increased risk of involvement in acts of violence and contracting contagious diseases. Why WHILE higher the drinking age youth can go to learn to control themselves because they can look at others asbehave blame alcoholI will disagree, if the government decided to lower the age to use alcohol. Young men between ( 16 & 21 years old ) does something, like they are unaware and everyone know what alcohol cause to people. when i was doing my five hours class before i got my appointment for the test. Our teacher, let us watched a movie,I disagree because a lot of young people die for drink , so many youngers don’t have conscience and they die in accidents they only want to have fun and that’s it but they don’t think in the problem in the future , the best age for drink for me is 23 but everything is depend .I think that the articulate is very important for all persons and specially the young people who drink heavily. the young people abuse of you body because not only consume alcohol bot also drugs. Adults have the right to monitor the movements of young people, so that you do not pass any problem, it is the best.I think they should not the drinking age be lowered, first of all because is no good for health and teenagers are more vulnerable to do mistakes and get more easily persuade for friends to do bad things, including legal troubles like drive a car after they drink alcohol, somebody can be abused more easily when they are drinking alcohol, poor academics and family problems.I disagree, because if some adults don’t have control when are drinking the young people less because they want to experiment new thing, they don’t have sufficient maturity that is why they have binge drinking. In this time the young don’t respect their parents and anything, the parents loss the control, is necessary the young people drink when they have 21 years old in that time they have more responsible about their live.I disagree, because someone might be crazy enough to dare someone to drink beer then get in the car to drive. Then you wouldn’t get in trouble if the limit is lowered plus someone could get seriously hurt or killed.I think the drinking age shouldnt be lowered because people will start to get out of control and put their life and possibly others in danger. Now, if you get caught drinking under the age of 21, then you will get a consequence. They made it the age 21 for a reason. But, if they change the age to 18 or 19 then somebody will get hurt.i don’t think it should be lowered because younger people may not know how control their alcohol and it would increase accidents and other tragedies.No the drinking age should not be lowered because Recent results from a national survey found that by eighth grade, approximately 27 percent had used alcohol, which increased to 66 percent by 12th grade. Additionally, a second national survey indicated that among high school seniors, about 20 percent binge drank, consuming more than 5 drinks in one occasion, during the two-week period preceding the survey, this is bad because heavy drinking is associated with negative social, mental and physical health outcomes including risk of violent behavior, sexual assault, accidents that cause injury, additional drug use, poor academics, legal troubles, and family and interpersonal problems. When young people drink it could mess up their brains and they could possibly die. That is why we should not lower the age for drinking. The age 21 is fine.+I think the drinking age should not be lowered as that many consequences can be developed and also occur. This can effect the growth and life of the teen and early adult.Sign up for our free newsletter.

Log In http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/local/ci_10297136 Should drinking age be lowered? - Sentinel & Enterprise Clark University President John Bassett said he signed a petition suggesting possibly lowering the drinking age because he felt it was the first petition he ""saw that placed the problem of binge drinking on the national agenda."" Bassett, whose college is in Worcester, joined more than 100 college presidents and chancellors who signed their names to the Amethyst Initiative, a petition suggesting that the current drinking age of 21 is ""not working,"" citing a ""culture of dangerous, clandestine binge-drinking"" among young adults. The petition sparked national debate over the drinking age of 21. ""I think the problem we have to address is that it is hurting people's health, which is a bad thing,"" Bassett said of binge drinking. ""I think we need to engage as a national dialogue on the issue and that's what the initiative is."" Bassett said he wants a discussion to determine the root cause of binge and dangerous drinking. ""Does this mean lowering the drinking age to 18? Not necessarily,"" he said. ""We need to find what lies behind the behavior, and some people say it's only because it's illegal that people behave that way. Well, I'm not sure."" The initiative avoids calling explicitly for a younger drinking age. It instead seeks ""an informed and dispassionate debate"" over the issue and the federal highway law that made 21 the national drinking age by denying money to any state that bucks the trend.However, the Amethyst Initiative states that while adults under 21 can vote and enlist in the military, they ""are told they are not mature enough to have a beer."" It further states, ""by choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law."" According to the Center of Disease Control Web site, alcohol is the ""most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the United States, more than tobacco and illicit drugs."" The CDC claims people between the ages of 12 and 20 drink 11 percent of all alcohol consumed in America. CDC statistics claim ""more than 90 percent of this alcohol is consumed in the form of binge drinks."" The National Institute of Alcohol and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as typically five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks for women, in an approximate two-hour period. A recent Associated Press analysis of federal records found that 157 college-age people, 18 to 23, drank themselves to death from 1999 through 2005. Currently, eight Massachusetts college and university presidents signed the initiative, as well as the president of the University of Massachusetts system, which consists of multiple campuses. Colleges whose presidents signed include Hampshire College, Endicott College, Mount Holyoke College, and Smith University. Bassett said he feels there are other cultural factors leading to binge drinking behavior. He also said that binge drinking did not exist years ago, when the legal drinking age was older than 21 in some states. ""If we were to prove that lowering the drinking age solves the problem, I'd support it,"" Bassett said. ""If we lower the drinking age and it doesn't solve the problem, we've done something bad, not good. I think probably half of the presidents (who signed the initiative) are big supporters of the lower age, but the other half are not. They're saying we know what the problem is, but we don't know what the solution is."" Fitchburg State College president Robert Antonucci said he saw the petition but declined to sign it. ""We have not had issues here with drinking,"" Antonucci said. ""It has not been a major concern of ours and the state has had some experience of a lower drinking age in the '70s. There were issues. There is always going to be underage drinking, no matter what the age limit, but I fear if we lower it, the (binge) drinking is going to get lower (in age) than it already is."" Fitchburg High School Principal Richard Masciarelli said he struggled to find the positive benefit of lowering the drinking age, which could potentially affect more than just 18-year-old seniors.  Masciarelli said it could affect 18-year-old athletes who would potentially have to choose between Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association regulations that strictly prohibit drinking and a state law allowing alcohol consumption. ""We have a great number of mature 18-year-olds at Fitchburg High, but I don't understand why we'd want to increase their responsibility level and force them to make difficult decisions when it's a very reasonable decision to make them wait for any particular age, like it is set up now at 21 (years of age),"" Masciarelli said. ""As opposed to an 18-year old being put in extra peer-pressure situations that I don't think are necessary."" Peerless Package store worker Andrew Goodwin thinks 18-year olds can ""probably"" be expected to make wise decisions about alcohol, since they are legally allowed to vote at the same age. ""I understand that you certainly have to protect younger people, but on some level I don't know that maturity changes a great deal between 18 and 21 (years of age),"" Goodwin said. However, Goodwin said lowering binge drinking might require more cultural immersion, rather than merely lowering the drinking age so younger people can drink. ""To some degree, it may be safer to do it where alcohol is a part of the culture and you're familiar with it at a younger age so you learn how to deal with it,"" Goodwin said. ""The last thing you want is somebody to have to learn how to deal with alcohol when they're also learning how to be away from home, being at college or something like that."" Mothers Against Drunk Driving Massachusetts Chapter spokesperson David DeIuliis said the drinking age, since it was signed into law in 1984, has ""saved about 1,000 lives a year."" ""Nationwide Insurance released a survey on the very topic, and 78 percent of people surveyed rejected this,"" DeIuliis said. ""We look at it and don't see a reason to go back in time when states set their own drinking age, and the age range of 16 through 20, nearly half of all motor vehicle fatalities in that age range were alcohol related. We've already seen the damage that this could cause and I don't understand why 100 college and university presidents want to go back and try that failed experiment again.""

Should the U.S. lower its drinking age? | WQAD.com Editor’s note: This story is part of a series on the 30th anniversary of the National Minimum Age Drinking Act, passed by Congress on July 17, 1984.(CNN) — Dwight B. Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people.When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6.No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals.By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision.Related: Experts say legal ages to drive, and to drink, should be switched“In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.”Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states — and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 — that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since.Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing.But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age — or at least encouraging states to set their own limits?The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries — Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others — with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine.“I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP.“The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.”MADD about underage drinkingTwo generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 — or owning an ID that says you are — to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different.After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer?By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course.Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol — effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied.Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 — a bigger decline than for older age groups.“Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement.The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year, while MADD calls the legislation “one of the nation’s most important and lifesaving laws.”A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury.The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age.A stalled movementThere’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president.Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.”“Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week.“It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.”Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open.In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere.“We missed our moment,” he said.Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far.Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18.“There isn’t much appetite to change something that appears to be working,” said Martinic of ICAP. “It’s not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It’s pretty much a no go.”But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government.And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit — not unlike a driver’s license — upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.Do you think the drinking age in the U.S. should be lowered? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments.Trademark and Copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

But then all 50 states raised it again to 21 when Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act — for fear of losing a portion of federal highway money. But does a uniform drinking age of 21 work? Should the drinking age be lowered? Room for Debate asks the same question in “You Must Be 21 to Drink.” Gabrielle Glaser, the author of “Her Best-Kept Secret: Why Women Drink — and How They Can Regain Control,” writes in favor of returning the drinking age to 18: Return the drinking age to 18 — and then enforce the law. The current system, which forbids alcohol to Americans under 21, is widely flouted, with disastrous consequences. Teaching people to drink responsibly before they turn 21 would enormously enhance public health. Now, high school and college kids view dangerous binge drinking as a rite of passage.The current law, passed in all 50 states in the 1980s, was intended to diminish the number of traffic deaths caused by young drunk drivers. It has succeeded in that — but tougher seatbelt and D.U.I. rules have contributed to the decrease, too. Raising the drinking age hasn’t reduced drinking — it’s merely driven it underground, to the riskiest of settings: unsupervised high school blowouts and fraternity parties that make “Animal House” look quaint. This age segregation leads the drinking away from adults, who could model moderation. The roots of this extreme drinking lie in our own history. Prohibition, which banned most alcohol in the United States from 1920 to 1933, normalized the frenzied sort of drinking that occurs today at college parties. In speakeasies and blind pigs, the goal was to drink as much and as soon as possible, because you never knew when the feds would show up. Today’s law, likewise, encourages young people to dodge the system. Like Prohibition — and abstinence-only sex education — it’s been a dismal failure. Tamika C. B. Zapolski, an assistant professor of psychology at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, argues in favor of keeping the drinking age high:Alcohol use in the United States is a serious public health concern, particularly among teenagers and young adults.Recent results from a national survey found that by eighth grade, approximately 27 percent had used alcohol, which increased to 66 percent by 12th grade. Additionally, a second national survey indicated that among high school seniors, about 20 percent binge drank, consuming more than 5 drinks in one occasion, during the two-week period preceding the survey. Heavy drinking is associated with negative social, mental and physical health outcomes — including risk of violent behavior, sexual assault, accidents that cause injury, additional drug use, poor academics, legal troubles, and family and interpersonal problems. Those most likely to experience harm from heavy drinking are young people, particularly those of college age.Thus lowering the drinking age would be harmful in two ways. First, young people, those most likely to be harmed from drinking, will have greater access to alcohol. Second, lowering the drinking age may lead to lowered perception of risk. When perception of risk from a particular substance decreases, prevalence rates tend to increase. Students: Read the Room for Debate feature, then tell us …— Should the drinking age be lowered? Why?— Does a higher drinking age encourage binge drinking, as alcohol is now forbidden for young people under 21?— If Americans are old enough to vote and join the military at the age of 18, should they be allowed to decide if they want to drink?— Or do you think alcohol is such a dangerous substance, especially when abused, that it should continue to be prohibited for those under 21? And does keeping a high drinking age save lives by decreasing drunken-driving fatalities?— Would lowering the drinking age send the wrong signal to young people, that drinking is not inherently risky?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below. Please use only your first name. For privacy policy reasons, we will not publish student comments that include a last name.Comments are no longer being accepted.I agree with the law of U.S.A is correctly because is for protection by all citizen of the country, because sometimes the young people specific under 21 years no have a lot responsabilities and no thinking in others when they drink, and cause accidents fatalities for people innocent.It is dangerous drink a lot alcohol, this is clear but that situation have long time, must the young people like to drink, people around the world drink before 18 year. if you love yourself don’t abuse to anything in the life. ” health body is health life” so be careful.due to favorable benefits has had the law not to allow the youth of 18 -19 to consume alcoholic beverages for security reasons both health and prevention in terms of accidents or Automobile sales intoxication ,I’m totally agree with the law not to allow alcohol to under 21.I’m totally agree that the law continue preventing alcohol exes.The should the drinking age can not be lowered. Because some time people the 18 age don’t have control when take alcohol. and have a bat behaviorI consider young people it is more dangerous to drink under 21 years. Because drink a lot of its considered a negative social include violent and addiction .I agree in unite state drink in public is considered a health concern than other country’s. people under 21 need way to be a 21 years for can drinks . Who drinks before 21 has a penalty for broken the roles.I think alcohol for age lowered is bad and dangerous because teenager don’t have a control when drink almost teenager drive because have permission for the families but sometime teenager drink alcohol and driving with alcohol and but this some accident in the road . teenager can not use alcohol because they can control when their drink… is better if they have 21 because they are responsible because I agree with the new rule of new York state .I agree that idea, because the teenagers think they have the control on everything. If in this country law was lowered drinking age will happen more accident. A good example is happening in Spain. Most students from many countries go to Spain because there is lowered drinking age 18. But the people who are living there complain all time about this situation,.I thing the young people should be more aware drinking is not a game and must wait for the right age to drink alcohol without hurry. perhaps should also expect the age of 21 for young peoples can join the military force or army so they do no feel entitled to take drinking earlyI agree what not can drink because the teenagers can’t measure the consequents about the alcohol in they brain and body not could react in a situation. Each person is conscious is aware of what makes not matter if is under 21 or not whe a person want drink , but is good always create awareness about the consequents the drink alcohol. In USA the teenagers are minor only for drink , whe needs some people for military in this moment anyone is under 21.l think young under 21 shouldn’t’ drink because sometimes they don’t see the consequences , more accident can happen for example: I was 18 I had different mind ,different opinion is ok when you are 21 you decide to go military service but alcohol is dangerous subtanceI agree with this article because the drinking age it should be lowered. Many young people drink and drive so that can be impossible, they can have an accident. They can drink when they return 21, but moderately and not drive when they are drinking. You can have fun without the alcohol.About the article I think is dangerous, because they are not prepared. I think the effects to be bad and they will have no control over what might happen and would not be good for health. I think at 21 years themselves can be responsible for their actionsIn my opinion wee see the big problem about the binge drinking in the teenager ,when you are teenager your bobby make changes ,if you drink your brain not going to work ,in my opinion alcohol it’s a big problem today because we have to much commercial in the TV about alcohol that’s make change in the mentality of the teenager that’s why we have to much alcoholic people today for resolve this problem the authority need to take care about this.I disagree that the age be lowered, they can to continue to be prohibited for those under 21 or more because some of them are 21 years old but aren’t mature and irresponsible, in the stores they can to forbid the sale of more than one bottle of alcohol for each one.think the age for alcohol consumption should not be reduced because young people are less likely to develop disruptive behavior due to alcohol include excessive drinking, can see that while younger are more young people are eceden to drink more alcohol and their behavior has to have more impact on the health and safety of young himself, including damage to his conduct, risk of death and increased risk of involvement in acts of violence and contracting contagious diseases. Why WHILE higher the drinking age youth can go to learn to control themselves because they can look at others asbehave blame alcoholI will disagree, if the government decided to lower the age to use alcohol. Young men between ( 16 & 21 years old ) does something, like they are unaware and everyone know what alcohol cause to people. when i was doing my five hours class before i got my appointment for the test. Our teacher, let us watched a movie,I disagree because a lot of young people die for drink , so many youngers don’t have conscience and they die in accidents they only want to have fun and that’s it but they don’t think in the problem in the future , the best age for drink for me is 23 but everything is depend .I think that the articulate is very important for all persons and specially the young people who drink heavily. the young people abuse of you body because not only consume alcohol bot also drugs. Adults have the right to monitor the movements of young people, so that you do not pass any problem, it is the best.I think they should not the drinking age be lowered, first of all because is no good for health and teenagers are more vulnerable to do mistakes and get more easily persuade for friends to do bad things, including legal troubles like drive a car after they drink alcohol, somebody can be abused more easily when they are drinking alcohol, poor academics and family problems.I disagree, because if some adults don’t have control when are drinking the young people less because they want to experiment new thing, they don’t have sufficient maturity that is why they have binge drinking. In this time the young don’t respect their parents and anything, the parents loss the control, is necessary the young people drink when they have 21 years old in that time they have more responsible about their live.I disagree, because someone might be crazy enough to dare someone to drink beer then get in the car to drive. Then you wouldn’t get in trouble if the limit is lowered plus someone could get seriously hurt or killed.I think the drinking age shouldnt be lowered because people will start to get out of control and put their life and possibly others in danger. Now, if you get caught drinking under the age of 21, then you will get a consequence. They made it the age 21 for a reason. But, if they change the age to 18 or 19 then somebody will get hurt.i don’t think it should be lowered because younger people may not know how control their alcohol and it would increase accidents and other tragedies.No the drinking age should not be lowered because Recent results from a national survey found that by eighth grade, approximately 27 percent had used alcohol, which increased to 66 percent by 12th grade. Additionally, a second national survey indicated that among high school seniors, about 20 percent binge drank, consuming more than 5 drinks in one occasion, during the two-week period preceding the survey, this is bad because heavy drinking is associated with negative social, mental and physical health outcomes including risk of violent behavior, sexual assault, accidents that cause injury, additional drug use, poor academics, legal troubles, and family and interpersonal problems. When young people drink it could mess up their brains and they could possibly die. That is why we should not lower the age for drinking. The age 21 is fine.+I think the drinking age should not be lowered as that many consequences can be developed and also occur. This can effect the growth and life of the teen and early adult.Sign up for our free newsletter.

Log In http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/local/ci_10297136 Should drinking age be lowered? - Sentinel & Enterprise Clark University President John Bassett said he signed a petition suggesting possibly lowering the drinking age because he felt it was the first petition he ""saw that placed the problem of binge drinking on the national agenda."" Bassett, whose college is in Worcester, joined more than 100 college presidents and chancellors who signed their names to the Amethyst Initiative, a petition suggesting that the current drinking age of 21 is ""not working,"" citing a ""culture of dangerous, clandestine binge-drinking"" among young adults. The petition sparked national debate over the drinking age of 21. ""I think the problem we have to address is that it is hurting people's health, which is a bad thing,"" Bassett said of binge drinking. ""I think we need to engage as a national dialogue on the issue and that's what the initiative is."" Bassett said he wants a discussion to determine the root cause of binge and dangerous drinking. ""Does this mean lowering the drinking age to 18? Not necessarily,"" he said. ""We need to find what lies behind the behavior, and some people say it's only because it's illegal that people behave that way. Well, I'm not sure."" The initiative avoids calling explicitly for a younger drinking age. It instead seeks ""an informed and dispassionate debate"" over the issue and the federal highway law that made 21 the national drinking age by denying money to any state that bucks the trend.However, the Amethyst Initiative states that while adults under 21 can vote and enlist in the military, they ""are told they are not mature enough to have a beer."" It further states, ""by choosing to use fake IDs, students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law."" According to the Center of Disease Control Web site, alcohol is the ""most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the United States, more than tobacco and illicit drugs."" The CDC claims people between the ages of 12 and 20 drink 11 percent of all alcohol consumed in America. CDC statistics claim ""more than 90 percent of this alcohol is consumed in the form of binge drinks."" The National Institute of Alcohol and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as typically five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks for women, in an approximate two-hour period. A recent Associated Press analysis of federal records found that 157 college-age people, 18 to 23, drank themselves to death from 1999 through 2005. Currently, eight Massachusetts college and university presidents signed the initiative, as well as the president of the University of Massachusetts system, which consists of multiple campuses. Colleges whose presidents signed include Hampshire College, Endicott College, Mount Holyoke College, and Smith University. Bassett said he feels there are other cultural factors leading to binge drinking behavior. He also said that binge drinking did not exist years ago, when the legal drinking age was older than 21 in some states. ""If we were to prove that lowering the drinking age solves the problem, I'd support it,"" Bassett said. ""If we lower the drinking age and it doesn't solve the problem, we've done something bad, not good. I think probably half of the presidents (who signed the initiative) are big supporters of the lower age, but the other half are not. They're saying we know what the problem is, but we don't know what the solution is."" Fitchburg State College president Robert Antonucci said he saw the petition but declined to sign it. ""We have not had issues here with drinking,"" Antonucci said. ""It has not been a major concern of ours and the state has had some experience of a lower drinking age in the '70s. There were issues. There is always going to be underage drinking, no matter what the age limit, but I fear if we lower it, the (binge) drinking is going to get lower (in age) than it already is."" Fitchburg High School Principal Richard Masciarelli said he struggled to find the positive benefit of lowering the drinking age, which could potentially affect more than just 18-year-old seniors.  Masciarelli said it could affect 18-year-old athletes who would potentially have to choose between Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association regulations that strictly prohibit drinking and a state law allowing alcohol consumption. ""We have a great number of mature 18-year-olds at Fitchburg High, but I don't understand why we'd want to increase their responsibility level and force them to make difficult decisions when it's a very reasonable decision to make them wait for any particular age, like it is set up now at 21 (years of age),"" Masciarelli said. ""As opposed to an 18-year old being put in extra peer-pressure situations that I don't think are necessary."" Peerless Package store worker Andrew Goodwin thinks 18-year olds can ""probably"" be expected to make wise decisions about alcohol, since they are legally allowed to vote at the same age. ""I understand that you certainly have to protect younger people, but on some level I don't know that maturity changes a great deal between 18 and 21 (years of age),"" Goodwin said. However, Goodwin said lowering binge drinking might require more cultural immersion, rather than merely lowering the drinking age so younger people can drink. ""To some degree, it may be safer to do it where alcohol is a part of the culture and you're familiar with it at a younger age so you learn how to deal with it,"" Goodwin said. ""The last thing you want is somebody to have to learn how to deal with alcohol when they're also learning how to be away from home, being at college or something like that."" Mothers Against Drunk Driving Massachusetts Chapter spokesperson David DeIuliis said the drinking age, since it was signed into law in 1984, has ""saved about 1,000 lives a year."" ""Nationwide Insurance released a survey on the very topic, and 78 percent of people surveyed rejected this,"" DeIuliis said. ""We look at it and don't see a reason to go back in time when states set their own drinking age, and the age range of 16 through 20, nearly half of all motor vehicle fatalities in that age range were alcohol related. We've already seen the damage that this could cause and I don't understand why 100 college and university presidents want to go back and try that failed experiment again.""

14,Tablets vs. Textbooks,Should Tablets Replace Textbooks in K-12 Schools?,1s14q2r,http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/on_innovation/2012/08/should_your_school_replace_textbooks_with_ereaders.html,Should Your School Replace Textbooks With E-Readers? - Vander Ark on Innovation - Education Week,"Tom Vander Ark « Something In Common: The Common Core Standards | Main | DIY: 7 Business Basics High School Grads Should Know » Guest post by Sarah Cargill, Getting Smart This February, President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan challenged the nation to transition to digital textbooks in the next five years. Only a month prior, Apple announced the ever so controversial iBooks 2 for iPad, which partnered the biggest leaders in publishing, put textbook writing in the hands of many, and drove down the cost of classroom reading (with the exception of the cost of the iPad). As the shift to digital picks up momentum, administrators and educators have rushed to adopt 1:1 programs with iPads, Chromebooks, and netbooks. Yet, what about e-readers? E-readers took center stage with the release of the first Kindle in November 2007. By the end of 2011, Amazon reported that e-book sales surpassed paperback sales for the first time. The consumer shift to digital reading was apparent. Yet, what about the education market? This month, I got my hands on two popular e-readers: Barnes & Noble's NOOK Simple Touch, priced at $99, and Sony's Ultra-Light Reader WiFi Touch, priced at $129.99. Both devices are incredibly small and lightweight, lightening the load of textbooks. They're also durable with flexible plastic that is safe tossed into a bag or backpack. Being an iPad user myself, I reached out to my network of e-reader fanatics and educators for some additional thoughts. You may have seen the comedic commercials from Kindle that took a stab at the Apple iPad's shiny LED screen. The Ultra-Light Reader displays a matte, black and white screen, making it easier on the eyes and more book-like. There's also real value in the Nook's E Ink screen and ""Glowlight,"" which make it easy to read in sunlight, at night, and especially in the classroom. At a basic functionality of tech in the classroom, sunlight should never be an inhibitor to learning. ""I love my Nook Simple Touch because the pages remind me of a classic paperback. Although I am extremely innovative, there is something about a backlight while I am reading a book that I do not like,"" said Ali Freezman, an SEO consultant at SEER Interactive, in conversation. ""For things like reading magazines and the news I prefer to have the LED screen so I can see photos and videos in color. But when it is a book, it needs to look like a book."" Yet, reading books, magazines, and PDFs is all it does. Many administrators and educators are looking to e-readers like the Nook as low-cost and digital replacements for textbooks to put a lock down on distractions found on other e-readers or tablets. ""We often compare technology distractions to some ideal that doesn't really exist,"" said educator Adam Renfro. ""It's not like kids have 100 percent focus now, but that's what we compare it too. I think most kids have 'winked out' after 20 minutes in our artificial world of school that resembles something more like a museum display than the real world."" Renfro recalls that his daughter was permitted to bring an e-reader to school, but not an iPad or tablet, for strictly digital reading purposes. Yet like many Generation Z students, she didn't stay enchanted long. ""After getting used to the iPad, she told a friend that a Nook was how their ancestors read books,"" said Renfro. ""So I upgraded her to a Kindle Fire, which is basically a tablet."" Innovative educators like Renfro have different ideas in mind for digital textbooks and tablets, which transform the ""distractions"" schools fear: engagement, collaboration, content creation, and more. Their solution is a device that emulates more of a tablet or netbook, rather than simply a reading device. The Ultra-Light Reader comes close to the functionality of the tablet with: ""I believe an e-reader that allows for customization of font size, audio options, dictionary support, Internet research, note taking, and organization of notes can help students read and comprehend content at new levels that were not accessible to them previously,"" said educator Alison Anderson. ""They also give instant access to books that previously had to be ordered, delivered, etc. There is a movement towards digital, up-to-date textbooks, so students can always read relevant information instead of outdated, recycled texts."" ""In the newer e-readers, you can share your annotations with your teacher,"" added Renfro. ""I'm a big annotator, and I like how it changes reading into an 'active' exercise.

Should Your School Replace Textbooks With E-Readers? - Vander Ark on Innovation - Education Week Tom Vander Ark « Something In Common: The Common Core Standards | Main | DIY: 7 Business Basics High School Grads Should Know » Guest post by Sarah Cargill, Getting Smart This February, President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan challenged the nation to transition to digital textbooks in the next five years. Only a month prior, Apple announced the ever so controversial iBooks 2 for iPad, which partnered the biggest leaders in publishing, put textbook writing in the hands of many, and drove down the cost of classroom reading (with the exception of the cost of the iPad). As the shift to digital picks up momentum, administrators and educators have rushed to adopt 1:1 programs with iPads, Chromebooks, and netbooks. Yet, what about e-readers? E-readers took center stage with the release of the first Kindle in November 2007. By the end of 2011, Amazon reported that e-book sales surpassed paperback sales for the first time. The consumer shift to digital reading was apparent. Yet, what about the education market? This month, I got my hands on two popular e-readers: Barnes & Noble's NOOK Simple Touch, priced at $99, and Sony's Ultra-Light Reader WiFi Touch, priced at $129.99. Both devices are incredibly small and lightweight, lightening the load of textbooks. They're also durable with flexible plastic that is safe tossed into a bag or backpack. Being an iPad user myself, I reached out to my network of e-reader fanatics and educators for some additional thoughts. You may have seen the comedic commercials from Kindle that took a stab at the Apple iPad's shiny LED screen. The Ultra-Light Reader displays a matte, black and white screen, making it easier on the eyes and more book-like. There's also real value in the Nook's E Ink screen and ""Glowlight,"" which make it easy to read in sunlight, at night, and especially in the classroom. At a basic functionality of tech in the classroom, sunlight should never be an inhibitor to learning. ""I love my Nook Simple Touch because the pages remind me of a classic paperback. Although I am extremely innovative, there is something about a backlight while I am reading a book that I do not like,"" said Ali Freezman, an SEO consultant at SEER Interactive, in conversation. ""For things like reading magazines and the news I prefer to have the LED screen so I can see photos and videos in color. But when it is a book, it needs to look like a book."" Yet, reading books, magazines, and PDFs is all it does. Many administrators and educators are looking to e-readers like the Nook as low-cost and digital replacements for textbooks to put a lock down on distractions found on other e-readers or tablets. ""We often compare technology distractions to some ideal that doesn't really exist,"" said educator Adam Renfro. ""It's not like kids have 100 percent focus now, but that's what we compare it too. I think most kids have 'winked out' after 20 minutes in our artificial world of school that resembles something more like a museum display than the real world."" Renfro recalls that his daughter was permitted to bring an e-reader to school, but not an iPad or tablet, for strictly digital reading purposes. Yet like many Generation Z students, she didn't stay enchanted long. ""After getting used to the iPad, she told a friend that a Nook was how their ancestors read books,"" said Renfro. ""So I upgraded her to a Kindle Fire, which is basically a tablet."" Innovative educators like Renfro have different ideas in mind for digital textbooks and tablets, which transform the ""distractions"" schools fear: engagement, collaboration, content creation, and more. Their solution is a device that emulates more of a tablet or netbook, rather than simply a reading device. The Ultra-Light Reader comes close to the functionality of the tablet with: ""I believe an e-reader that allows for customization of font size, audio options, dictionary support, Internet research, note taking, and organization of notes can help students read and comprehend content at new levels that were not accessible to them previously,"" said educator Alison Anderson. ""They also give instant access to books that previously had to be ordered, delivered, etc. There is a movement towards digital, up-to-date textbooks, so students can always read relevant information instead of outdated, recycled texts."" ""In the newer e-readers, you can share your annotations with your teacher,"" added Renfro. ""I'm a big annotator, and I like how it changes reading into an 'active' exercise. Traditional classroom books you can't markup and annotate, but it's not a problem with e-readers."" ""E-readers also lighten student's backpacks, but that should NOT be the only motivation or benefit for integrating e-readers into the classroom! I think that should really just be a bonus,"" added Anderson. Still, the device falls short of the ability to allow students to practice writing and collaboration - valuable 21st century skills.

This morning I woke up and deleted all my social media. My Instagram, Twitter, and personal Facebook accounts (I deleted my Facebook business page a year earlier), all gone. I ghosted from the party. As a small business, it’s a bold move (if not insane) to walk away from such successful pages (I had over 60,000 followers between the three platforms). But I had had enough, and here’s why.If you’re unaware, I started a podcast last year, wherein I interview photographers throughout the industry. In one of the interviews I interviewed Italian photographer Sara Lando. In our chat we discussed what it’s like to create art in the age of social media. She raised a fantastic point about how social media trains creatives to be inauthentic. At the least, social media trains us to stay within the lane of our “brand”.  An ill-curated feed results in disorder and unfollows galore. At its worst, social media changes the way we create, fundamentally.In our conversation, Sara makes a point that over time, social media trains us to create and post in a manner that pleases the apps’ algorithm. If a post does really well and followers respond well to a certain kind of image or technique, we begin to form a Pavlovian drive to replicate that response. For example, when I post an image with a lot of red, or shutter drag, those images would outperform my other posts by two or three times. Over time this began to motivate me to not only post more images with movement or red, but I would also shoot more in that manner. My art was becoming a meme.Aside from the social media affecting the type of work that I create, there is also the human element to consider. Personally, I am someone who gleans much of my information through external data points. I overthink everything. This makes social media a minefield for someone like me. I would analyze likes and follows and unfollows and draw conclusions based off what were likely benign engagements, and I would arrive at concrete and final conclusions that negatively impacted real life relationships. It sucked, to put it mildly.I personally believe that humans aren’t built to have relationships with thousands of people. We can care for a core group of friends and family, and beyond that our interactions will be short and shallow, and relationships will inevitably fall between the cracks. This was a conversation that I had in a different episode, with Jay Gullion. Yet I continued to push myself to try and make social media work, to have no enemies, to love everyone I interacted with. In the end, it proved to be an impossible task.For years I viewed social media as a necessary evil. I invested thousands of hours and even more dollars to promote and position my brand (self?). Running a small business is work enough, without factoring in how to leverage work and art in the ever-changing social media game. I went back and forth, debating whether my business could survive without a social media presence.I launched my LLC in January of 2007, meaning that my business never existed in a time without social media. At the time I used Myspace and Flickr. Then it became Tumblr and Facebook. Then Twitter and Instagram were the obvious choices. All the while I held the thought that if I pushed my social media accounts hard enough, my work would be seen by the right people and the big clients would start rolling in. So I kept pushing.The main reason I had selected Jay to interview for my podcast is that he maintains a posture that stands in opposition to current society. Though Jay is a photographer (and designer and director, etc, etc), he has no website, his Instagram posts are vague and infrequent, and yet his business is thriving. He creates campaigns for a number of luxury brands (Land Rover, Hermès, Bottega Veneta), and yet he rarely posts about it and almost no one knows who he is. This echoed what I had been long told by industry elders: it’s about your network— who you know. No social media account or agent or client is going to be your savior. Word of mouth is always the key to success in a small business, which comes from doing right by your clients and creating work as often as you can. Jay’s curious case study gave me just the data (and permission) that I needed to take the leap.One other idea we discussed in our conversation was the philosophical idea of “if a tree falls in a forest”, but in terms of art-making. If I create something beautiful— something I am immensely proud of— do I need to share it on social media? Do I need others to affirm it? Can the act of creation be enough? Can I keep the beauty for myself? Though I didn’t have an answer at the time, I have decided to try and find out for myself.Nick Fancher is a photographer, author, and educator who specializes in dramatic lighting, often employing the use of bold colors and experimental camera techniques.

53,Corporate Tax Rate & Jobs,Does Lowering the Federal Corporate Income Tax Rate Create Jobs?,2s53q9r,https://taxfoundation.org/benefits-cutting-corporate-income-tax-rate/,The Benefits of Cutting the Corporate Income Tax Rate | Tax Foundation,"Help us achieve a world where the tax code doesn't stand in the way of success. The Tax Foundation is the nation’s leading independent tax policy nonprofit. Since 1937, our principled research, insightful analysis, and engaged experts have informed smarter tax policy at the federal, state, and global levels. For over 80 years, our goal has remained the same: to improve lives through tax policies that lead to greater economic growth and opportunity. Erica York Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the United States corporate income tax was widely regarded as uncompetitive for three main reasons: cost recovery, worldwide application, and a high statutory rate. Lawmakers made significant changes to each of these factors in the new tax law enacted in December 2017. The long-run positive effects expected from the TCJA–increases in investment, output, and wages–are entirely due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate, because other pro-growth provisions are scheduled to expire.Before the TCJA, the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, at 38.9 percent (federal plus the average of state corporate income tax rates). The TCJA reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent and placing the U.S. nearer to the OECD average.A permanently lower federal corporate income tax rate will lead to several positive economic effects. The benefits of a lower rate include encouraging investment in the United States and discouraging profit shifting. As additional investment grows the capital stock, the demand for labor to work with the new capital will increase, leading to higher productivity, output, employment, and wages over time. Become a TCJA Expert With Our 2-week Crash Course! Under a neoclassical economic view, the main drivers of economic output are the willingness of people to work more and to deploy capital—such as machines, equipment, factories, etc.[1] Taxes play a role in these decisions; specifically, the corporate income tax rate is an important determinant in how much people are willing to invest in new capital, and in where they will place that new capital.Evidence shows that of the different types of taxes, the corporate income tax is the most harmful for economic growth.[2] One key reason that capital is so sensitive to taxation is because capital is highly mobile. For example, it is relatively easy for a company to move its operations or choose to locate its next investment in a lower-tax jurisdiction, but it is more difficult for a worker to move his or her family to get a lower tax bill. This means capital is very responsive to tax changes; lowering the corporate income tax rate reduces the amount of economic harm it causes.A common misunderstanding is that corporations bear the cost of the corporate income tax. However, a growing body of economic literature indicates that the true burden of the corporate income is split between workers through lower wages and owners of the corporation.[3] As capital moves away in response to high statutory corporate income tax rates, productivity and wages for the relatively immobile workers fall. Empirical studies show that labor bears between 50 and 100 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax.[4] In the long run, it is split evenly by both capital and labor.[5]To understand why the lower corporate tax rate drives growth in capital stock, wages, jobs, and the overall size of the economy, it is important to understand how the corporate income tax rate affects economic decisions. When firms think about making an investment in a new capital good, like a piece of equipment, they add up all the costs of doing so, including taxes, and weigh those costs against the expected revenue the capital will generate.The higher the tax, the higher the cost of capital, the less capital that can be created and employed.[6] So, a higher corporate income tax rate reduces the long-run capital stock and reduces the long-run size of the economy.[7] Conversely, lowering the corporate income tax incentivizes new investment, leading to an increase of the capital stock.Capital formation, which results from investment, is the major force for raising incomes across the board.[8] More capital for workers boosts productivity, and productivity is a large determinant of wages and other forms of compensation. This happens because, as businesses invest in additional capital, the demand for labor to work with the capital rises, and wages rise too.[9] It is because of these economic effects that, of all the permanent elements considered during the tax reform debates, reducing the corporate tax rate was the most pro-growth.[10]The last time the United States reduced the federal corporate income tax was in 1986, but since then, countries throughout the world significantly reduced their statutory rates. From 1980 to 2017, the worldwide corporate tax rate declined from an average of 38 percent to about 23 percent.[11] Over this period, the United States maintained a comparatively high, and uncompetitive, corporate income tax rate. Become a TCJA Expert With Our 2-week Crash Course! Of 202 jurisdictions surveyed in 2017, the United States had the fourth highest statutory corporate income tax rate.[12] And among OECD nations, the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate at 38.9 percent.[13] This was approximately 15 percentage points higher than the OECD average, excluding the United States at 23.8 percent.Tax rate differences, such as that between the United States and other OECD countries, create incentives for firms to earn more income in low-tax jurisdictions and less income in higher-tax jurisdictions.[14] Because the United States had a corporate income tax rate that was much higher than the norm, the U.S. was especially susceptible to base erosion through profit shifting.[15] Thus the United States needed a corporate tax rate that was closer to the norm in order to reduce the incentive for firms to shift profits or physical capital and jobs to lower-tax jurisdictions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent. This puts the United States slightly above the OECD average of 24 percent, but slightly below the average weighted by GDP.According to the Tax Foundation’s Taxes and Growth Model, the combined effect of all the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the long-run size of the U.S. economy by 1.7 percent.[16] The larger economy would result in 1.5 percent higher wages, a 4.8 percent larger capital stock, and 339,000 additional full-time equivalent jobs in the long run.Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, November 2017.The reduction in the corporate tax rate drives these long-run economic benefits by significantly lowering the cost of capital.Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, November 2017. Note: This long-run GDP growth figure is larger than the 1.7 percent of total growth from the plan because several other provisions have negative growth effects. A full list of economic effects by provisions is found in Table 5 of Preliminary Details and Analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.The international corporate tax landscape has changed over the past several decades, as noted above, and the average statutory rates in all regions saw a net decline between 1980 and 2017.[17] Once the highest rate in the OECD, the United States corporate income tax rate is now closer to the middle of the pack. This will encourage other countries to move away from high taxes on capital toward more competitive corporate income tax rates.The increase in the U.S.’s competitiveness implies a relative reduction in the competitiveness of other nations. For example, a recent report from the International Monetary Fund recommends to Canada: “It is time for a careful rethink of corporate taxation to improve efficiency and preserve Canada’s position in a rapidly changing international tax environment.”[18] The report also notes that the U.S. tax reform increased the urgency of this needed review.This recommendation has been echoed in other countries. For example, lawmakers in Australia are considering reducing their corporate income tax rate by 5 percentage points to 25 percent, reportedly because “the need to reduce the tax burden on businesses had become more pressing for future Australian jobs and investment since the 2016 election because the United States had reduced its top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.”[19] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act improved the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting new investment, and other countries are likely to respond with further improvements in their tax systems.It is important for lawmakers to recognize and understand the economic benefits of a globally competitive corporate tax rate, and the trade-offs that increasing the rate would entail. A corporate tax rate that is more in line with our competitors reduces the incentives for firms to realize their profits in lower-tax jurisdictions and encourages companies to invest in the United States. Raising the corporate income tax rate would dismantle the most significant pro-growth provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and carry significant economic consequences.The table below considers the economic effects of raising the corporate tax rate to 22 and 25 percent from the current baseline of 21 percent. Raising the corporate income tax rate would reduce economic growth, and lead to a smaller capital stock, lower wage growth, and reduced employment.Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, June 2018For example, permanently raising the corporate rate by 1 percent to 22 percent would reduce long-run GDP by over $56 billion; the smaller economy would result in a 0.5 percent decrease in capital stock, 0.18 percent decrease in wages, and 44,500 fewer full-time equivalent jobs. Raising the rate to 25 percent would reduce GDP by more than $220 billion and result in 175,700 fewer jobs.Raising the corporate tax rate increases the cost of making investments in the United States. Under a higher tax rate, some investments wouldn’t be made, which leads to less capital formation, and fewer jobs with lower wages.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent, the highest statutory rate in the developed world, to a more globally competitive 21 percent. This significant change is what drives the projected economic effects of the TCJA, which include increased investment, employment, wages, and output.Given the positive economic effects of a lower corporate tax rate, lawmakers should avoid viewing the corporate income tax as a potential source of raising additional revenue. Raising the corporate tax rate would walk back one of the most significant pro-growth provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and reduce the global competitiveness of the United States. Economic evidence indicates that it is workers who bear the final burden of the corporate income tax, and that corporate income taxes are the most harmful for economic growth—raising this tax rate is not advisable.The new, permanently lowered corporate tax rate makes the United States a more attractive place for companies to locate investments and will discourage profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. The lower rate incentives new investments that will increase productivity, and lead to higher levels of output, employment, and income in the long run. By permanently lowering the corporate tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lawmakers succeeded in making the United States a more globally competitive location for new investment, jobs, innovation, and growth.

The Benefits of Cutting the Corporate Income Tax Rate | Tax Foundation Help us achieve a world where the tax code doesn't stand in the way of success. The Tax Foundation is the nation’s leading independent tax policy nonprofit. Since 1937, our principled research, insightful analysis, and engaged experts have informed smarter tax policy at the federal, state, and global levels. For over 80 years, our goal has remained the same: to improve lives through tax policies that lead to greater economic growth and opportunity. Erica York Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the United States corporate income tax was widely regarded as uncompetitive for three main reasons: cost recovery, worldwide application, and a high statutory rate. Lawmakers made significant changes to each of these factors in the new tax law enacted in December 2017. The long-run positive effects expected from the TCJA–increases in investment, output, and wages–are entirely due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate, because other pro-growth provisions are scheduled to expire.Before the TCJA, the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, at 38.9 percent (federal plus the average of state corporate income tax rates). The TCJA reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent and placing the U.S. nearer to the OECD average.A permanently lower federal corporate income tax rate will lead to several positive economic effects. The benefits of a lower rate include encouraging investment in the United States and discouraging profit shifting. As additional investment grows the capital stock, the demand for labor to work with the new capital will increase, leading to higher productivity, output, employment, and wages over time. Become a TCJA Expert With Our 2-week Crash Course! Under a neoclassical economic view, the main drivers of economic output are the willingness of people to work more and to deploy capital—such as machines, equipment, factories, etc.[1] Taxes play a role in these decisions; specifically, the corporate income tax rate is an important determinant in how much people are willing to invest in new capital, and in where they will place that new capital.Evidence shows that of the different types of taxes, the corporate income tax is the most harmful for economic growth.[2] One key reason that capital is so sensitive to taxation is because capital is highly mobile. For example, it is relatively easy for a company to move its operations or choose to locate its next investment in a lower-tax jurisdiction, but it is more difficult for a worker to move his or her family to get a lower tax bill. This means capital is very responsive to tax changes; lowering the corporate income tax rate reduces the amount of economic harm it causes.A common misunderstanding is that corporations bear the cost of the corporate income tax. However, a growing body of economic literature indicates that the true burden of the corporate income is split between workers through lower wages and owners of the corporation.[3] As capital moves away in response to high statutory corporate income tax rates, productivity and wages for the relatively immobile workers fall. Empirical studies show that labor bears between 50 and 100 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax.[4] In the long run, it is split evenly by both capital and labor.[5]To understand why the lower corporate tax rate drives growth in capital stock, wages, jobs, and the overall size of the economy, it is important to understand how the corporate income tax rate affects economic decisions. When firms think about making an investment in a new capital good, like a piece of equipment, they add up all the costs of doing so, including taxes, and weigh those costs against the expected revenue the capital will generate.The higher the tax, the higher the cost of capital, the less capital that can be created and employed.[6] So, a higher corporate income tax rate reduces the long-run capital stock and reduces the long-run size of the economy.[7] Conversely, lowering the corporate income tax incentivizes new investment, leading to an increase of the capital stock.Capital formation, which results from investment, is the major force for raising incomes across the board.[8] More capital for workers boosts productivity, and productivity is a large determinant of wages and other forms of compensation. This happens because, as businesses invest in additional capital, the demand for labor to work with the capital rises, and wages rise too.[9] It is because of these economic effects that, of all the permanent elements considered during the tax reform debates, reducing the corporate tax rate was the most pro-growth.[10]The last time the United States reduced the federal corporate income tax was in 1986, but since then, countries throughout the world significantly reduced their statutory rates. From 1980 to 2017, the worldwide corporate tax rate declined from an average of 38 percent to about 23 percent.[11] Over this period, the United States maintained a comparatively high, and uncompetitive, corporate income tax rate. Become a TCJA Expert With Our 2-week Crash Course! Of 202 jurisdictions surveyed in 2017, the United States had the fourth highest statutory corporate income tax rate.[12] And among OECD nations, the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate at 38.9 percent.[13] This was approximately 15 percentage points higher than the OECD average, excluding the United States at 23.8 percent.Tax rate differences, such as that between the United States and other OECD countries, create incentives for firms to earn more income in low-tax jurisdictions and less income in higher-tax jurisdictions.[14] Because the United States had a corporate income tax rate that was much higher than the norm, the U.S. was especially susceptible to base erosion through profit shifting.[15] Thus the United States needed a corporate tax rate that was closer to the norm in order to reduce the incentive for firms to shift profits or physical capital and jobs to lower-tax jurisdictions.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent. This puts the United States slightly above the OECD average of 24 percent, but slightly below the average weighted by GDP.According to the Tax Foundation’s Taxes and Growth Model, the combined effect of all the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the long-run size of the U.S. economy by 1.7 percent.[16] The larger economy would result in 1.5 percent higher wages, a 4.8 percent larger capital stock, and 339,000 additional full-time equivalent jobs in the long run.Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, November 2017.The reduction in the corporate tax rate drives these long-run economic benefits by significantly lowering the cost of capital.Source: Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model, November 2017. Note: This long-run GDP growth figure is larger than the 1.7 percent of total growth from the plan because several other provisions have negative growth effects. A full list of economic effects by provisions is found in Table 5 of Preliminary Details and Analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.The international corporate tax landscape has changed over the past several decades, as noted above, and the average statutory rates in all regions saw a net decline between 1980 and 2017.[17] Once the highest rate in the OECD, the United States corporate income tax rate is now closer to the middle of the pack. This will encourage other countries to move away from high taxes on capital toward more competitive corporate income tax rates.The increase in the U.S.’s competitiveness implies a relative reduction in the competitiveness of other nations. For example, a recent report from the International Monetary Fund recommends to Canada: “It is time for a careful rethink of corporate taxation to improve efficiency and preserve Canada’s position in a rapidly changing international tax environment.”[18] The report also notes that the U.S. tax reform increased the urgency of this needed review.This recommendation has been echoed in other countries.

The study also differs from others as it takes the participants' parents into account, who were interviewed on their child's behaviour afterwards.  Teenagers completed questions on their personality and gaming over the past month, while carers filled in a survey on their child's recent aggressive behaviours. The researchers also found almost one in two of the girls - and two in three of the boys - play them. Lead author Professor Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the University of Oxford, said: 'The idea violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn't tested very well over time.'Despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern.'The study published in Royal Society Open Science is the first of its kind. The teenagers provided reports of their recent gaming experiences, with the violent content coded using official EU and US ratings.Parents also provided evaluations of their adolescents' aggressive behaviours in the past month.

One theory is that violent games affect those who are mentally vulnerable and suffer from things like depression and mood swings.Professor Przybylski said: 'Nearly all young people in the developed world now play video games, and this popularity has driven concerns about the possible negative effects of this recreational activity.Parents and legislators have long worried about the impact violent games have on  teenagers. The release of the latest Red Dead Redemption (pictured) made headlines around the world In a recent study, researchers looked at the three games participants played most, and noted if they were of a violent nature (such as shooting game Call of Duty) or non-violent (such as Fifa).They tracked the brainwaves of participants using electroencephalography (EEG).At the same time they completed a 'stop-signal task' which contained male and female faces looking either happy or scared.The study found gaming was linked to lower empathy and emotional callousness.Researchers believe this is because it inhibits people's ability to process emotional facial expression and control their responses as a result. 'Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely as a function of demographics and personal experiences with games.'Some researchers conclude gaming has social and cognitive benefits, whereas others argue the medium contributes to mass-shootings, and for consistent and strong effects on aggressive behaviour, more broadly.The American Psychological Association has warned youngsters' time spent playing video games should be limited.Yet the Australian and Swedish governments have concluded there is no actionable evidence that aggressive behaviour results from youth gaming.Professor Przybylski said: 'The question of whether adolescent engagement with violent video games drives aggressive behaviour in young people is a critically important one.'Indeed, our data indicated these games were regularly played by almost half of female and two-thirds of male teens in the UK.'Given this popularity, one might argue that a small effect linking violent gaming to aggressive behaviour would have consequences for society as a whole.' Co author Dr Netta Weinstein, of Cardiff University, said: 'Our findings suggest researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games.'An important step taken in the study included the researchers publicly registering their hypothesis, methods and analysis technique prior to the start.Professor Przybylski said: 'Part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results.'A cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. The registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.'While no link was found between playing video games and aggressive behaviour in teenagers, the researchers emphasise that this does not mean that some mechanics and situations in gaming do not provoke angry feelings or reactions in players.

'Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely as a function of demographics and personal experiences with games.'Some researchers conclude gaming has social and cognitive benefits, whereas others argue the medium contributes to mass-shootings, and for consistent and strong effects on aggressive behaviour, more broadly.The American Psychological Association has warned youngsters' time spent playing video games should be limited.Yet the Australian and Swedish governments have concluded there is no actionable evidence that aggressive behaviour results from youth gaming.Professor Przybylski said: 'The question of whether adolescent engagement with violent video games drives aggressive behaviour in young people is a critically important one.'Indeed, our data indicated these games were regularly played by almost half of female and two-thirds of male teens in the UK.'Given this popularity, one might argue that a small effect linking violent gaming to aggressive behaviour would have consequences for society as a whole.' Co author Dr Netta Weinstein, of Cardiff University, said: 'Our findings suggest researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games.'An important step taken in the study included the researchers publicly registering their hypothesis, methods and analysis technique prior to the start.Professor Przybylski said: 'Part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results.'A cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. The registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.'While no link was found between playing video games and aggressive behaviour in teenagers, the researchers emphasise that this does not mean that some mechanics and situations in gaming do not provoke angry feelings or reactions in players. 'Anecdotally, you do see things such as trash-talking, competitiveness and trolling in gaming communities that could qualify as antisocial behaviour. This would be an interesting avenue for further research,' he added.",1186,1166

High 31F. Winds WSW at 5 to 10 mph..Partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late. Low 18F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: March 14, 2019 @ 9:30 amThe Helena Independent Record publishes letters from readers in the Opinion section. Here are this week's letters.To submit a letter to the editor, go here.Bill 303 presented by Rep. Greg DeVries that wishes to make school voluntary and not mandatory has some very good points: Our schools are being used to indoctrinate children to believe there is no God, to think that there are no spiritual penalties for immoral behavior, and to promote liberal philosophies. Children are growing up without hope and our suicide rate demonstrates the results. Parents should have a say in what is being taught to their children.However, making school voluntary is not the answer. School became mandatory in the first place because children who were not in school were being used by unscrupulous adults. Gangs of children roamed the streets picking pockets. Child prostitution was out of control. Crime rates among children went through the roof in our cities. Requiring that children be in school kept the children from falling victim to criminals who would take advantage of them. It established order in cities.Colorado has put parents in charge of their children’s education by allowing charter schools and vouchers. The money follows the child. This means the parents can choose schools where their children learn certain skills, such as speaking a second language or learning computer technology, carpentry or mechanics in addition to the basics. Montessori schools, where children are taught with the multisensory method became an option. Home-school parents received waivers to pay for books and supplies. Christian schools were only part of the equation, but they, too received waiver funding.“We’ve never done it that way before,” are the words of a dying culture. Let’s not think that way! Montana does have a problem: Let’s fix it. Montana can only profit from putting its parents – instead of the state - in charge of education. Parents are in charge of charter schools. Schools become competitive and strive to become better. If parents don’t like what is being taught, they can take their child – and their money – elsewhere.Of course Eric Feaver is dead set against allowing charter schools. It would mean dividing the public money into other pots that would not let him and his elite group of liberal thinkers shape our children. But considering what evil is being taught to our children in the name of education in our public schools, and considering Montana’s high child suicide rate, it is time to break up this monopoly and give parents a choice.Does Montana have enough money to start charter schools? Yes, it does. And Montana will have even more money for schools as parents from non-choice states move here to enjoy the freedom of choosing their children’s type of education. School choice is an attraction. Grants from wealthy people often establish and follow charter schools.Montana needs to branch out, not dry up by continuing to narrow school choices. The more options we offer, the more people will be drawn here, and the more our economy will grow. Freedom results in greater wealth potential. Choice results in better schools.Charter schools are true freedom of choice. But leaving the option open for children to roam our streets and to be used by criminals is not a good idea.Sheri SchofieldHelenaI have spent nearly four years at Helena High School, now as student body president, and I’m disappointed to see people try to create a controversy where there isn’t one.Though there are many people arguing otherwise, the change in color of graduation gowns is not a transgender issue, but rather an issue of equity and creating a fair and comfortable environment for all of our students, not just the ones who yell the loudest. Times are changing and it is important that we change with them.I have been hearing people defend the “tradition” for weeks now. However, gender-specific gowns have only been used since 2007. When I look at the parents of my peers as well as students graduating from other high schools around Montana in monochromatic gowns, I see no residual psychological damage; whereas some students have to add the unnecessary stress over being outed to their friends and family and having a target on their back.I want to harbor an environment of acceptance and empathy in my school. When I scan the crowd of my peers at graduation, I won’t be seeing gender or gown color, I will be seeing my friends and fellow graduates.Rachel JakovacHelenaIf presidential petulance is all that is is needed to declare a national emergency, the country has been in constant crisis since the election.It will be interesting to see how the judicial system struggles to impose some objective standards upon this impending declaration. Or not. When the case inevitably winds it way to the Supreme Court, constitutional safeguards against the indiscriminate display of executive temper tantrums may be among the last considerations that the newly emerged majority on the high court will factor into the decision process.When did this national emergency regarding immigration actually begin? Was it when Eastern Europeans of certain ethnic origins were forced to leave their homelands as fascism developed? Perhaps a bit further back in history when the potato famine drove Irish farmers to our shores? Or maybe it was when the pilgrims first hit the East Coast and established a community to escape religious prosecution in their homeland?Stand by. The next angry tweet is just around the corner.Randy DixHelenaProposals to add work requirements to Montana’s Medicaid eligibility are alarming and shortsighted. People aren’t on Medicaid because they won’t, or don’t want to, work. The vast majority of Medicaid recipients do work, are ill or disabled, are in school or are taking care of family members.If lawmakers are concerned with helping more Montanans find steady work, there are better ways — high-quality job training, child care, affordable transportation, higher education and a decent minimum wage. One solution could be to increase investment in Montana’s Health and Economic Livelihood Partnership Link (HELP-Link), which provides services such as career counseling and on-the-job training. Of the 3,000-plus Medicaid clients who completed DLI workforce training programs in 2016, 70 percent were employed after finishing their training.Lawmakers cite other states’ requirements as examples, but it is important to note that harsh requirements in other states provide no support for accessing work either. Work requirements only serve to kick people off their health care. Taking health care coverage from people doesn’t help them find a job.Medicaid covers one in 10 Montanans and is working well. Let’s not lose our momentum in providing proper care for thousands of Montanans.Reginald HagemanHelenaElsie Arntzen should resign as Montana’s superintendent of Public Instruction. She is failing to uphold her constitutional duties when she advocates and supports state aid to private schools.Let’s be clear. Article X, Section 1 of the Constitution of Montana explicitly states that it is the state’s responsibility for our public schools. And Article X, Section 6 explicitly states “Aid prohibited to sectarian schools.”At a rally for public funding for private schools on Jan. 24, Ms. Arntzen demonstrated her support for “school choice.” (IR 1/25/2019)School choice already exists. Public schools — the constitutional responsibility of the state — are supported by tax dollars. Private schools — the responsibility of private entities — are supported by private money.Instead of advocating “school choice,” Ms. Arntzen should provide compelling leadership to fund adequately Montana’s schools and financially strapped rural schools so those schools can recruit and retain quality teachers.As superintendent, Ms. Arntzen's constitutional obligation clearly is to public schools. Should she prefer working to advance private schools, she should resign her position and do just that.John C. BoardHelenaRep. Greg DeVries voted against HB 175. I also don’t support it. State government is inefficient and run by at least some who don’t make sound decisions. Examples of government doing something efficiently and cost-effectively are hard to find. If you have examples, please share. But, legislation that gives them more money doesn’t make good fiscal sense.I was a state employee for almost 18 years until Riverside Youth Correctional Facility in Boulder was suddenly temporarily closed for renovation last October. Riverside has not yet reopened. Unfortunately, peculiar handling of a state facility is not new. Remember the Legislature’s closing of Montana Developmental Center?HB 175 includes raises for state employees. Should we increase the salaries of Reginald Michael (agency head, DOC), making $53.27 an hour, according to https://transparency.mt.gov, and Cynthia Wolken (operations manager, DOC), making $57.20 an hour? No, indeed! They should demonstrate accountability for questionable decisions at DOC they have been part of, instead of getting a raise.It’s difficult to understand why some legislators vote against legislation containing pay raises for state employees, yet, it is the right thing to do. Until existing state revenues are correctly handled, let’s not give the state more money.Susanne ShultzBoulderEl Chapo, the Mexican drug lord, escaped from his last Mexican prison through a mile-long tunnel his accomplices dug for him. Tunnels are a specialty of the cartels and they make much use of them to smuggle people, drugs, whatever.Look at any Mexican border town (Tijuana, Nogales, etc.) and you'll see houses and buildings all along the border fence/wall/barrier. Thousands and thousands of houses within a mile of the border, each one a potential entry point for a cartel-built tunnel. And who says the tunnels can't be 2 miles, or longer? That's why ""a big, beautiful wall"" is such a waste of money.We need to be smarter than that if we're really going to address border security.Eric StimsonHelenaThe administrators, counselors and teachers in the Helena and East Helena School Districts deserve congratulations for all they are doing to educate their students about issues related to suicide! We at NAMI Helena hope they continue their outstanding efforts. There is only one negative. Due to the nature of suicide most of them will never know about the lives they have saved.Dr. Gary Mihelish, PresidentNAMI HelenaI've written to all of the FWP commissioners to ask if they'd be willing to discuss either allowing crossbows for hunters that can't draw their bows anymore (due to things like worn out shoulders) or adding them to normal bow hunting equipment.Fifteen states allow the use of crossbows to people who can't draw their bows anymore, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Utah and Vermont. There are also 31 states that allow anyone to use crossbows, including Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Since hunting is such a huge part of Montana's history and Montanan's lifestyle, I think its time that Montana caught up to the rest of the country and allowed crossbows during archery season. Maybe it has to be passed by the Montana Legislature and the commissioners have no authority over that, but I'm sure they could put a bug in the legislators' ears to get the ball rolling.Rich BillielGreat FallsIt was good to see a letter about why people vote the way they do, as I have been wondering how in the world Montanans re-elected Tester.Montanans voted against expanding Medicaid and against ruining the mining industry. Tester supported both initiatives. Tester voted for sanctuary cities and illegal immigration. Montanans are against both. Tester voted to decimate our health care system by voting for a bill he had not even read. He went along with Pelosi and Schumer and their disgusting rhetoric about Judge Kavanaugh.As for the veterans who have said he has done so much for us -- I hope they remember what he did during the Ben Ghazi atrocity and the lies he told about the man who was to be head of the VA. So far, he has gone along with whatever his party has called for. It will be interesting to see what he does when they want to confiscate all guns.Denise FellerEast HelenaFor now, medical aid in dying remains legal in Montana because of the Montana Supreme Court's 2009 decision that allows it. Unfortunately, Rep. Carl Glimm recently introduced HB 284 that would outlaw medical aid in dying in Montana and impose harsh penalties on doctors who participate. Why, I ask? Just what is it he hopes to accomplish?Oregon has had a ""death with dignity"" law since 1997 that was passed by initiative. The law works well, has had no documented abuses, and has held up against numerous challenges. In fact, when Oregon legislators (like Rep. Glimm) asked voters to repeal their death with dignity law, Oregonians overwhelmingly voted to keep it by a wide margin of 60 percent to 40 percent.From my perspective as a 75-year-old, Montana's law offers hope for those of us who may someday have to deal with a painful lingering terminal illness. It means no one will be ""legally required"" to suffer the kind of needless pain and anguish I have seen close friends and relatives endure. In fact, near the end of his life, my father-in-law said to me: ""I wish we were in Oregon."" I knew exactly what he meant, and the hopelessness in his voice and in his eyes just broke my heart.So here is my suggestion to Montana legislators. Oregon's ""death with dignity"" law has helped suffering Oregonians for over 20 years. Oregon is required to maintain strict records on death with dignity cases that are available to anyone. There have been no documented abuses. What are you worried about? Please protect the Baxter ruling and the Supreme Court’s wisdom. NO on HB 284Bob BalhiserHelenaYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.sửa chữa tivi Toshibasua tivi sharpsửa tivi tại hà đôngmua tivi cũ Obviously doctor assisted suicide is a homicide in Montana why else would the court suggest a potential defence. Preserve Individual Freedom Vote Yes HB284.I represent Montanans Against Assisted Suicide which is a single issue group that narrowly focuses on the language of euthanasia bills while we leave our beliefs or unbeliefs at the door. As such we have the potential largest set of supporters possible, that is those that stand for the individual and read the euthanasia bills/laws.Understand that 60% of Montanans favor the Concept until they read the language which dishonors the individual and empowers predatory corporations and others. Then 95% of the 60% say: “I’m not for that!” And as one of the Baxter justices commented “the legislature needs to speak to this issue”. And yes Montana is a laboratory of the Union and we have done our due diligence these past 10 years on this issue. Montana is nimble enough and has the standing to lead the Nation upholding the rights of the individual by banning euthanasia. Vote yes on HB284.Bradley Williams Bradley, what BS you peddle. I'll ask again, what predatory corporations are you referring to? Instead of trying to abolish physician assisted death with dignity choice for the terminally ill, why don't you push for legislation that requires a witness? Or are you just into S&M?RE: HHS gown color & tradition--Two colors for gowns were used way before 2007 - in the 50's, 60's & 70's at least (family pictures prove it & I graduated from HHS in 1971). That was when HHS colors were actually red & white (& the school song had words--""red & white, full of fight"").

Updated: March 14, 2019 @ 9:30 amThe Helena Independent Record publishes letters from readers in the Opinion section. Here are this week's letters.To submit a letter to the editor, go here.Bill 303 presented by Rep. Greg DeVries that wishes to make school voluntary and not mandatory has some very good points: Our schools are being used to indoctrinate children to believe there is no God, to think that there are no spiritual penalties for immoral behavior, and to promote liberal philosophies. Children are growing up without hope and our suicide rate demonstrates the results. Parents should have a say in what is being taught to their children.However, making school voluntary is not the answer. School became mandatory in the first place because children who were not in school were being used by unscrupulous adults. Gangs of children roamed the streets picking pockets. Child prostitution was out of control. Crime rates among children went through the roof in our cities. Requiring that children be in school kept the children from falling victim to criminals who would take advantage of them. It established order in cities.Colorado has put parents in charge of their children’s education by allowing charter schools and vouchers. The money follows the child. This means the parents can choose schools where their children learn certain skills, such as speaking a second language or learning computer technology, carpentry or mechanics in addition to the basics. Montessori schools, where children are taught with the multisensory method became an option. Home-school parents received waivers to pay for books and supplies. Christian schools were only part of the equation, but they, too received waiver funding.“We’ve never done it that way before,” are the words of a dying culture. Let’s not think that way! Montana does have a problem: Let’s fix it. Montana can only profit from putting its parents – instead of the state - in charge of education. Parents are in charge of charter schools. Schools become competitive and strive to become better. If parents don’t like what is being taught, they can take their child – and their money – elsewhere.Of course Eric Feaver is dead set against allowing charter schools. It would mean dividing the public money into other pots that would not let him and his elite group of liberal thinkers shape our children. But considering what evil is being taught to our children in the name of education in our public schools, and considering Montana’s high child suicide rate, it is time to break up this monopoly and give parents a choice.Does Montana have enough money to start charter schools? Yes, it does. And Montana will have even more money for schools as parents from non-choice states move here to enjoy the freedom of choosing their children’s type of education. School choice is an attraction. Grants from wealthy people often establish and follow charter schools.Montana needs to branch out, not dry up by continuing to narrow school choices. The more options we offer, the more people will be drawn here, and the more our economy will grow. Freedom results in greater wealth potential. Choice results in better schools.Charter schools are true freedom of choice. But leaving the option open for children to roam our streets and to be used by criminals is not a good idea.Sheri SchofieldHelenaI have spent nearly four years at Helena High School, now as student body president, and I’m disappointed to see people try to create a controversy where there isn’t one.Though there are many people arguing otherwise, the change in color of graduation gowns is not a transgender issue, but rather an issue of equity and creating a fair and comfortable environment for all of our students, not just the ones who yell the loudest. Times are changing and it is important that we change with them.I have been hearing people defend the “tradition” for weeks now. However, gender-specific gowns have only been used since 2007. When I look at the parents of my peers as well as students graduating from other high schools around Montana in monochromatic gowns, I see no residual psychological damage; whereas some students have to add the unnecessary stress over being outed to their friends and family and having a target on their back.I want to harbor an environment of acceptance and empathy in my school. When I scan the crowd of my peers at graduation, I won’t be seeing gender or gown color, I will be seeing my friends and fellow graduates.Rachel JakovacHelenaIf presidential petulance is all that is is needed to declare a national emergency, the country has been in constant crisis since the election.It will be interesting to see how the judicial system struggles to impose some objective standards upon this impending declaration. Or not. When the case inevitably winds it way to the Supreme Court, constitutional safeguards against the indiscriminate display of executive temper tantrums may be among the last considerations that the newly emerged majority on the high court will factor into the decision process.When did this national emergency regarding immigration actually begin? Was it when Eastern Europeans of certain ethnic origins were forced to leave their homelands as fascism developed? Perhaps a bit further back in history when the potato famine drove Irish farmers to our shores? Or maybe it was when the pilgrims first hit the East Coast and established a community to escape religious prosecution in their homeland?Stand by. The next angry tweet is just around the corner.Randy DixHelenaProposals to add work requirements to Montana’s Medicaid eligibility are alarming and shortsighted. People aren’t on Medicaid because they won’t, or don’t want to, work. The vast majority of Medicaid recipients do work, are ill or disabled, are in school or are taking care of family members.If lawmakers are concerned with helping more Montanans find steady work, there are better ways — high-quality job training, child care, affordable transportation, higher education and a decent minimum wage. One solution could be to increase investment in Montana’s Health and Economic Livelihood Partnership Link (HELP-Link), which provides services such as career counseling and on-the-job training. Of the 3,000-plus Medicaid clients who completed DLI workforce training programs in 2016, 70 percent were employed after finishing their training.Lawmakers cite other states’ requirements as examples, but it is important to note that harsh requirements in other states provide no support for accessing work either. Work requirements only serve to kick people off their health care. Taking health care coverage from people doesn’t help them find a job.Medicaid covers one in 10 Montanans and is working well. Let’s not lose our momentum in providing proper care for thousands of Montanans.Reginald HagemanHelenaElsie Arntzen should resign as Montana’s superintendent of Public Instruction. She is failing to uphold her constitutional duties when she advocates and supports state aid to private schools.Let’s be clear. Article X, Section 1 of the Constitution of Montana explicitly states that it is the state’s responsibility for our public schools. And Article X, Section 6 explicitly states “Aid prohibited to sectarian schools.”At a rally for public funding for private schools on Jan. 24, Ms. Arntzen demonstrated her support for “school choice.” (IR 1/25/2019)School choice already exists. Public schools — the constitutional responsibility of the state — are supported by tax dollars. Private schools — the responsibility of private entities — are supported by private money.Instead of advocating “school choice,” Ms. Arntzen should provide compelling leadership to fund adequately Montana’s schools and financially strapped rural schools so those schools can recruit and retain quality teachers.As superintendent, Ms. Arntzen's constitutional obligation clearly is to public schools. Should she prefer working to advance private schools, she should resign her position and do just that.John C. BoardHelenaRep. Greg DeVries voted against HB 175. I also don’t support it. State government is inefficient and run by at least some who don’t make sound decisions. Examples of government doing something efficiently and cost-effectively are hard to find. If you have examples, please share. But, legislation that gives them more money doesn’t make good fiscal sense.I was a state employee for almost 18 years until Riverside Youth Correctional Facility in Boulder was suddenly temporarily closed for renovation last October. Riverside has not yet reopened. Unfortunately, peculiar handling of a state facility is not new. Remember the Legislature’s closing of Montana Developmental Center?HB 175 includes raises for state employees. Should we increase the salaries of Reginald Michael (agency head, DOC), making $53.27 an hour, according to https://transparency.mt.gov, and Cynthia Wolken (operations manager, DOC), making $57.20 an hour? No, indeed! They should demonstrate accountability for questionable decisions at DOC they have been part of, instead of getting a raise.It’s difficult to understand why some legislators vote against legislation containing pay raises for state employees, yet, it is the right thing to do. Until existing state revenues are correctly handled, let’s not give the state more money.Susanne ShultzBoulderEl Chapo, the Mexican drug lord, escaped from his last Mexican prison through a mile-long tunnel his accomplices dug for him. Tunnels are a specialty of the cartels and they make much use of them to smuggle people, drugs, whatever.Look at any Mexican border town (Tijuana, Nogales, etc.) and you'll see houses and buildings all along the border fence/wall/barrier. Thousands and thousands of houses within a mile of the border, each one a potential entry point for a cartel-built tunnel. And who says the tunnels can't be 2 miles, or longer? That's why ""a big, beautiful wall"" is such a waste of money.We need to be smarter than that if we're really going to address border security.Eric StimsonHelenaThe administrators, counselors and teachers in the Helena and East Helena School Districts deserve congratulations for all they are doing to educate their students about issues related to suicide! We at NAMI Helena hope they continue their outstanding efforts. There is only one negative. Due to the nature of suicide most of them will never know about the lives they have saved.Dr. Gary Mihelish, PresidentNAMI HelenaI've written to all of the FWP commissioners to ask if they'd be willing to discuss either allowing crossbows for hunters that can't draw their bows anymore (due to things like worn out shoulders) or adding them to normal bow hunting equipment.Fifteen states allow the use of crossbows to people who can't draw their bows anymore, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Utah and Vermont. There are also 31 states that allow anyone to use crossbows, including Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.Since hunting is such a huge part of Montana's history and Montanan's lifestyle, I think its time that Montana caught up to the rest of the country and allowed crossbows during archery season. Maybe it has to be passed by the Montana Legislature and the commissioners have no authority over that, but I'm sure they could put a bug in the legislators' ears to get the ball rolling.Rich BillielGreat FallsIt was good to see a letter about why people vote the way they do, as I have been wondering how in the world Montanans re-elected Tester.Montanans voted against expanding Medicaid and against ruining the mining industry. Tester supported both initiatives. Tester voted for sanctuary cities and illegal immigration. Montanans are against both. Tester voted to decimate our health care system by voting for a bill he had not even read. He went along with Pelosi and Schumer and their disgusting rhetoric about Judge Kavanaugh.As for the veterans who have said he has done so much for us -- I hope they remember what he did during the Ben Ghazi atrocity and the lies he told about the man who was to be head of the VA. So far, he has gone along with whatever his party has called for. It will be interesting to see what he does when they want to confiscate all guns.Denise FellerEast HelenaFor now, medical aid in dying remains legal in Montana because of the Montana Supreme Court's 2009 decision that allows it. Unfortunately, Rep. Carl Glimm recently introduced HB 284 that would outlaw medical aid in dying in Montana and impose harsh penalties on doctors who participate. Why, I ask? Just what is it he hopes to accomplish?Oregon has had a ""death with dignity"" law since 1997 that was passed by initiative. The law works well, has had no documented abuses, and has held up against numerous challenges. In fact, when Oregon legislators (like Rep. Glimm) asked voters to repeal their death with dignity law, Oregonians overwhelmingly voted to keep it by a wide margin of 60 percent to 40 percent.From my perspective as a 75-year-old, Montana's law offers hope for those of us who may someday have to deal with a painful lingering terminal illness. It means no one will be ""legally required"" to suffer the kind of needless pain and anguish I have seen close friends and relatives endure. In fact, near the end of his life, my father-in-law said to me: ""I wish we were in Oregon."" I knew exactly what he meant, and the hopelessness in his voice and in his eyes just broke my heart.So here is my suggestion to Montana legislators. Oregon's ""death with dignity"" law has helped suffering Oregonians for over 20 years. Oregon is required to maintain strict records on death with dignity cases that are available to anyone. There have been no documented abuses. What are you worried about? Please protect the Baxter ruling and the Supreme Court’s wisdom. NO on HB 284Bob BalhiserHelenaYour comment has been submitted.ReportedThere was a problem reporting this.sửa chữa tivi Toshibasua tivi sharpsửa tivi tại hà đôngmua tivi cũ Obviously doctor assisted suicide is a homicide in Montana why else would the court suggest a potential defence. Preserve Individual Freedom Vote Yes HB284.I represent Montanans Against Assisted Suicide which is a single issue group that narrowly focuses on the language of euthanasia bills while we leave our beliefs or unbeliefs at the door. As such we have the potential largest set of supporters possible, that is those that stand for the individual and read the euthanasia bills/laws.Understand that 60% of Montanans favor the Concept until they read the language which dishonors the individual and empowers predatory corporations and others. Then 95% of the 60% say: “I’m not for that!” And as one of the Baxter justices commented “the legislature needs to speak to this issue”. And yes Montana is a laboratory of the Union and we have done our due diligence these past 10 years on this issue. Montana is nimble enough and has the standing to lead the Nation upholding the rights of the individual by banning euthanasia. Vote yes on HB284.Bradley Williams Bradley, what BS you peddle. I'll ask again, what predatory corporations are you referring to? Instead of trying to abolish physician assisted death with dignity choice for the terminally ill, why don't you push for legislation that requires a witness? Or are you just into S&M?RE: HHS gown color & tradition--Two colors for gowns were used way before 2007 - in the 50's, 60's & 70's at least (family pictures prove it & I graduated from HHS in 1971). That was when HHS colors were actually red & white (& the school song had words--""red & white, full of fight""). The ""traditional"" school colors have changed over time so what if the gowns do, too? Log In Keep it Clean. Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd, racist or sexually-oriented language. PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR CAPS LOCK. Don't Threaten. Threats of harming another person will not be tolerated. Be Truthful. Don't knowingly lie about anyone or anything. Be Nice.

Legislation allowing a method of late-term abortion, also known as partial-birth abortion, in all situations.” More than two-thirds opposed both of these suggested legislative options.The survey did not ask about the status quo under Roe v. Wade, which essentially prohibits an abortion after a fetus has reached “viability” except to protect the life and health of the mother.But it asked which statements “best” reflect the person’s point of view, such as: “Abortion should be legal at any time during a pregnancy (21.7 percent) ...

5,Milk - Is It Healthy,Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?,1s5q1r,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190218-when-did-humans-start-drinking-cows-milk,BBC - Future - Why humans have evolved to drink milk,"Humans didn’t start out being able to digest animal milk – but now many populations do. Why has evolution favoured tolerating dairy? Dairy milk has competition. Alternative “milks” made from plants like soya or almonds are increasingly popular. These alternatives are often vegan-friendly and can be suitable for people who are allergic to milk, or intolerant of it. The runner-up in the 2018 series of The Apprentice (UK) ran a flavoured nut milk business.But the rise of alternative milks is just the latest twist in the saga of humanity’s relationship with animal milk. This relationship dates back thousands of years, and it has had a lot of ups and downs.When you think about it, milk is a weird thing to drink. It’s a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young; we have to squirt it out of the cow’s udders to obtain it.You might also like:• We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume • What would happen if the world went vegetarian?• Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold?In many cultures it is almost unheard of. Back in 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage people to consume more milk and dairy products for health reasons – a campaign that had to overcome the deep suspicions of many older Chinese people. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick.Milk is poured at a dairy farm in Russia. Compared to humanity’s 300,000-year history, drinking milk is a new habit (Credit: Getty)Set against the 300,000-year history of our species, drinking milk is quite a new habit. Before about 10,000 years ago or so, hardly anybody drank milk, and then only on rare occasions. The first people to drink milk regularly were early farmers and pastoralists in western Europe – some of the first humans to live with domesticated animals, including cows. Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, North America, and a patchwork of other places.Baby foodThere is a biological reason why drinking animal milk is odd.Milk contains a type of sugar called lactose, which is distinct from the sugars found in fruit and other sweet foods. When we are babies, our bodies make a special enzyme called lactase that allows us to digest the lactose in our mother’s milk. But after we are weaned in early childhood, for many people this stops. Without lactase, we cannot properly digest the lactose in milk. As a result, if an adult drinks a lot of milk they may experience flatulence, painful cramps and even diarrhoea. (It’s worth noting that in other mammals, there aren’t any lactase-persistent adults – adult cows don’t have active lactase, and neither do cats or dogs, for example).So the first Europeans who drank milk probably farted a lot as a result. But then evolution kicked in: some people began to keep their lactase enzymes active into adulthood. This “lactase persistence” allowed them to drink milk without side effects. It is the result of mutations in a section of DNA that controls the activity of the lactase gene.Artwork from the tomb of Methethi in Egypt, dated to around 2350BC, shows an ancient Egyptian milking a cow (Credit: Getty)“The first time that we see the lactase persistence allele in Europe arising is around 5,000 years BP [before present] in southern Europe, and then it starts to kick in in central Europe around 3,000 years ago,” says assistant professor Laure Ségurel at the Museum of Humankind in Paris, who co-authored a 2017 review of the science of lactase persistence.The lactase persistence trait was favoured by evolution and today it is extremely common in some populations. In northern Europe, more than 90% of people are lactase persistent. The same is true in a few populations in Africa and the Middle East.But there are also many populations where lactase persistence is much rarer: many Africans do not have the trait and it is uncommon in Asia and South America.A woman purchases soy milk in Hong Kong. Dairy can make many people feel sick in Asia, where the lactase persistence trait is uncommon (Credit: Getty)It is hard to make sense of this pattern because we don’t know precisely why drinking milk, and therefore lactase persistence, was a good thing, says Ségurel: “Why was it so strongly advantageous in itself?”The obvious answer is that drinking milk gave people a new source of nutrients, reducing the risk of starvation. But on closer inspection this doesn’t hold up.“There’s a lot of different sources of food, so it’s surprising that one source of food is so important, so different from other sorts of food,” says Ségurel.People who are lactase-non-persistent can still eat a certain amount of lactose without ill effects, so drinking a small amount of milk is fine. There is also the option of processing milk into butter, yoghurt, cream or cheese – all of which reduce the amount of lactose. Hard cheeses like cheddar have less than 10% as much lactose as milk, and butter is similarly low. (Read more about parmigiano, a cheese with so little lactose it can be eaten by the lactose-intolerant). “Heavy cream and butter have the lowest lactose,” says Ségurel.Hard cheeses like parmigiano-reggiano can have little to no lactose (Credit: Getty)Accordingly, people seem to have invented cheese rather quickly. In September 2018, archaeologists reporting finding fragments of pottery in what is now Croatia. They carried fatty acids, suggesting that the pottery had been used to separate curds from whey: a crucial step in making cheese. If that is correct (and the interpretation has been questioned), people were making cheese in southern Europe 7,200 years ago. Similar evidence from slightly more recent times, but still more than 6,000 years ago, has been found elsewhere in Europe. This is well before lactase persistence became common in Europeans.That said, there is clearly a pattern behind which populations evolved high levels of lactase persistence and which didn’t, says genetics professor Dallas Swallow of University College London. Those with the trait are pastoralists: people who raise livestock. Hunter-gatherers, who do not keep animals, did not acquire the mutations. Neither did “forest gardeners” who cultivated plants, but not livestock.It makes sense that people who did not have access to animal milk were not under great evolutionary pressure to adapt to drinking it.The question is, why did some pastoralist people acquire the trait and not others?A Sudanese boy milks a cow at a cattle camp; an enduring mystery is why only some pastoralist groups acquired lactase persistence (Credit: Getty)Ségurel points to east Asian herding peoples, such as those in Mongolia, who have some of the lowest rates of lactase persistence even though they rely heavily on milk from their animals for food. The mutations were common in nearby populations in Europe and western Asia, so it would have been possible for them to spread into these east Asian groups, but they didn’t. “That’s the big puzzle,” says Ségurel.Dairy benefits Drinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value She speculates that drinking milk might have other advantages besides its nutritional value. People who keep livestock are exposed to their diseases, which can include anthrax and cryptosporidiosis. It may be that drinking cow’s milk provides antibodies against some of these infections. Indeed, milk's protective effect is thought to be one of the benefits of breastfeeding children.Women nurse their children in Bogota, Colombia for a World Breastfeeding Week event. Milk’s protective effect is thought to be a benefit of breastfeeding (Credit: Getty)But some of the mysterious absences of lactase-persistence could be down to sheer chance: whether anyone in a group of pastoralists happened to get the right mutation. Until fairly recently there were a lot fewer people on Earth and local populations were smaller, so some groups would miss out by plain bad luck.“I think the most coherent part of the picture is that there’s a correlation with the way of life, with pastoralism,” says Swallow. “But you have to have the mutation first.” Only then could natural selection go to work.In the case of Mongolian herders, Swallow points out that they typically drink fermented milk, which again has a lower lactose content. Arguably, the ease with which milk can be processed to be more edible makes the rise of lactase persistence even more puzzling. “Because we were so good at adapting culturally to processing and fermenting the milk, I’m struggling with why we ever adapted genetically,” says Swallow’s PhD student Catherine Walker.There may have been several factors promoting lactase persistence, not just one. Swallow suspects that the key may have been milk’s nutritional benefits, such as that it is rich in fat, protein, sugar and micronutrients like calcium and vitamin D.It is also a source of clean water. Depending on where your community lived, you may have evolved to tolerate it for one reason over another.It’s unclear whether lactase persistence is still being actively favoured by evolution, and thus whether it will become more widespread, says Swallow. In 2018 she co-authored a study of a group of pastoralists in the Coquimbo region of Chile, who acquired the lactase-persistence mutation when their ancestors interbred with newly-arrived Europeans 500 years ago. The trait is now spreading through the population: it is being favoured by evolution, as it was in northern Europeans 5,000 years ago.Dairy cows munch on alfalfa in north-western France, a part of the world where people would have adapted to drinking milk around 3,000 years ago (Credit: Getty)But this is a special case because the Coquimbo people are heavily reliant on milk. Globally, the picture is very different. “I would think it’s stabilised myself, except in countries where they have milk dependence and there is a shortage [of other food],” says Swallow. “In the West, where we have such good diets, the selective pressures are not really likely to be there.”Dairy decline?If anything, the news over the last few years offers the opposite impression: that people are abandoning milk. In November 2018, the Guardian published a story headlined “How we fell out of love with milk”, describing the meteoric rise of the companies selling oat and nut milks, and suggesting that traditional milk is facing a major battle.But the statistics tell a different story. According to the 2018 report of the IFCN Dairy Research Network, global milk production has increased every year since 1998 in response to growing demand. In 2017, 864 million tonnes of milk were produced worldwide. This shows no sign of slowing down: the IFCN expects milk demand to rise 35% by 2030 to 1,168 million tonnes. (Read more about how milk became a staple food in industrialised societies).Still, this masks some more localised trends. A 2010 study of food consumption found that in the US milk consumption has fallen over the last few decades – although it was replaced with fizzy drinks, not almond milk. This fall was balanced by growing demand in developing countries, especially in Asia – something the IFCN has also noted. Meanwhile, a 2015 study of people’s drinking habits in 187 countries found that milk drinking was more common in older people, which does suggest that it is less popular with the young – although this says nothing about young people’s consumption of milk products like yoghurt.While milk consumption has fallen in the US, in Asia demand is growing (Credit: Getty)Still, it seems unlikely that alternative milks will make much of a dent in the world’s growing appetite for milk, at least over the next decade.Walker adds that alternative milks are “not a like-for-like substitution” for animal milk. In particular, many don’t have the same micronutrients. She says they are most useful for vegans and for people allergic to milk – the latter being a reaction to milk protein, and nothing to do with lactose.Alternative milks like almond milk don’t normally have the same micronutrients as dairy (Credit: Getty)It’s particularly striking that so much of the growth in milk demand is in Asia, where most people are non-lactase-persistent. Whatever advantages the people there see in milk, they outweigh the potential digestive issues or the need to process the milk.In fact, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation has pushed for people in developing countries to keep more non-traditional dairy animals, such as llamas, so that they can obtain the benefits of milk even if cow’s milk is unavailable or too expensive.What’s more, a major study published in January described a “planetary health diet” that is designed to both maximise health and minimise our impact on the environment. While it entails drastically cutting down on red meat and other animal products, it nevertheless includes the equivalent of one glass of milk a day.Milk, it seems, is not down and out.

BBC - Future - Why humans have evolved to drink milk Humans didn’t start out being able to digest animal milk – but now many populations do. Why has evolution favoured tolerating dairy? Dairy milk has competition. Alternative “milks” made from plants like soya or almonds are increasingly popular. These alternatives are often vegan-friendly and can be suitable for people who are allergic to milk, or intolerant of it. The runner-up in the 2018 series of The Apprentice (UK) ran a flavoured nut milk business.But the rise of alternative milks is just the latest twist in the saga of humanity’s relationship with animal milk. This relationship dates back thousands of years, and it has had a lot of ups and downs.When you think about it, milk is a weird thing to drink. It’s a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young; we have to squirt it out of the cow’s udders to obtain it.You might also like:• We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume • What would happen if the world went vegetarian?• Should you avoid dairy when you have a cold?In many cultures it is almost unheard of. Back in 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage people to consume more milk and dairy products for health reasons – a campaign that had to overcome the deep suspicions of many older Chinese people. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick.Milk is poured at a dairy farm in Russia. Compared to humanity’s 300,000-year history, drinking milk is a new habit (Credit: Getty)Set against the 300,000-year history of our species, drinking milk is quite a new habit. Before about 10,000 years ago or so, hardly anybody drank milk, and then only on rare occasions. The first people to drink milk regularly were early farmers and pastoralists in western Europe – some of the first humans to live with domesticated animals, including cows. Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, North America, and a patchwork of other places.Baby foodThere is a biological reason why drinking animal milk is odd.Milk contains a type of sugar called lactose, which is distinct from the sugars found in fruit and other sweet foods. When we are babies, our bodies make a special enzyme called lactase that allows us to digest the lactose in our mother’s milk. But after we are weaned in early childhood, for many people this stops. Without lactase, we cannot properly digest the lactose in milk. As a result, if an adult drinks a lot of milk they may experience flatulence, painful cramps and even diarrhoea. (It’s worth noting that in other mammals, there aren’t any lactase-persistent adults – adult cows don’t have active lactase, and neither do cats or dogs, for example).So the first Europeans who drank milk probably farted a lot as a result. But then evolution kicked in: some people began to keep their lactase enzymes active into adulthood. This “lactase persistence” allowed them to drink milk without side effects. It is the result of mutations in a section of DNA that controls the activity of the lactase gene.Artwork from the tomb of Methethi in Egypt, dated to around 2350BC, shows an ancient Egyptian milking a cow (Credit: Getty)“The first time that we see the lactase persistence allele in Europe arising is around 5,000 years BP [before present] in southern Europe, and then it starts to kick in in central Europe around 3,000 years ago,” says assistant professor Laure Ségurel at the Museum of Humankind in Paris, who co-authored a 2017 review of the science of lactase persistence.The lactase persistence trait was favoured by evolution and today it is extremely common in some populations.

For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company reported net income attributable to common shares of $56.7 million ($10.61 per share), compared to $214.2 million ($38.52 per share) for the same period of 2017. The Company’s results for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017 include a significant net deferred income tax benefit related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December 2017. The results for 2018 and 2017 were affected by a number of items as described in the following paragraphs. Excluding these items, net income attributable to common shares was $255.0 million ($47.23 per share) for 2018, compared to $128.6 million ($22.93 per share) for 2017. Excluding these items, net income attributable to common shares was $75.6 million ($14.18 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $43.2 million ($7.77 per share) for the fourth quarter of 2017. (Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Information schedule attached to this release for additional details.) Items included in the Company’s net income for 2018 are listed below, and fourth quarter activity, if any, is highlighted for each item: Items included in the Company’s net income for 2017 are listed below, and fourth quarter activity, if any, is highlighted for each item: Revenue for 2018 was $2,696.0 million, up 4% from $2,591.8 million in 2017. Revenues increased at the television broadcasting and manufacturing divisions, offset by a decline at the education division. The Company reported operating income for 2018 of $246.2 million, an increase of 80%, from $136.4 million in 2017. Operating results improved at most of the Company’s divisions in 2018. For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue was $689.1 million, up 2% from $675.8 million in 2017. Revenues increased at the television broadcasting division and other businesses, offset by a decline at the education division. The Company reported operating income of $75.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $49.5 million in 2017, largely due to improved results at the television broadcasting division. On April 27, 2017, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan), a subsidiary of Graham Holdings Company entered into a Contribution and Transfer Agreement (Transfer Agreement) to contribute the institutional assets and operations of Kaplan University (KU) to an Indiana non-profit, public-benefit corporation that is a subsidiary affiliated with Purdue University (Purdue). The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transfer Agreement occurred on March 22, 2018. At the same time, the parties entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA) pursuant to which Kaplan provides key non-academic operations support to the new university. The new university operates largely online as an Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue under the name Purdue University Global (Purdue Global). Division Results Education Education division revenue in 2018 totaled $1,451.0 million, down 4% from $1,516.8 million in 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2018, education division revenue totaled $346.9 million, down 9% from $380.6 million for the same period of 2017. Kaplan reported operating income of $97.1 million for 2018, a 25% increase from $77.7 million in 2017; Kaplan reported operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 of $14.6 million, a 31% decrease from $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, operating results increased at Kaplan International, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional (U.S.), partially offset by decreased results at Higher Education. In recent years, Kaplan has formulated and implemented restructuring plans at its various businesses that have resulted in restructuring costs, with the objective of establishing lower cost levels in future periods. There were no significant restructuring charges during 2018. Across all businesses, restructuring costs totaled $9.1 million in 2017 and $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of the KU Transaction that closed on March 22, 2018, the Company has revised the financial reporting for its education division to provide operating results for Higher Education and Professional (U.S.). A summary of Kaplan’s operating results is as follows: Kaplan International includes English-language programs and postsecondary education and professional training businesses largely outside the United States. Kaplan International revenue increased 3% in 2018, and on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 1%, primarily due to growth in Pathways enrollments. Revenue declined 3% in the fourth quarter of 2018; however, on a constant currency basis, revenue remained flat. Kaplan International operating income increased 36% in 2018, due largely to improved results at English-language, Pathways and UK Professional. Operating income decreased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to a decline in results in Singapore and increased incentive compensation costs, offset by improved English-language results. Restructuring costs at Kaplan International totaled $2.9 million in 2017. Prior to the KU Transaction closing on March 22, 2018, Higher Education included Kaplan’s domestic postsecondary education business, made up of fixed-facility colleges and online postsecondary and career programs. Following the KU Transaction closing, the Higher Education division includes the results as a service provider to higher education institutions. In 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, Higher Education revenue declined 21% and 35%, respectively, due largely to the sale of KU on March 22, 2018 and fewer average enrollments at KU prior to the sale. The Company recorded $16.8 million of service fee with Purdue Global in its Higher Education operating results in 2018, based on an assessment of its collectability under the TOSA; no service fee with Purdue Global was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Each quarter, the Company assesses the collectability of the service fee with Purdue Global to make a determination as to whether to record all or part of the service fee and whether to make adjustments to service fee amounts recognized in earlier periods. Additionally, Higher Education reported losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to costs incurred that are not reimbursable under the TOSA. Restructuring costs at Higher Education were $1.4 million and $0.8 million for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) includes Kaplan’s standardized test preparation programs. In September 2018, KTP acquired the test preparation and study guide assets of Barron’s Educational Series, a New York-based education publishing company. KTP revenue declined 6% in 2018 due to reduced demand for classroom-based offerings, and the disposition of Dev Bootcamp, which made up the majority of KTP’s new economy skills training programs, offset in part by growth in online-based programs. Revenues were flat for the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding revenues from the Barron’s acquisition, revenues were down 5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to declines in demand for classroom-based offerings, offset in part by growth in online-based programs. KTP operating results improved in 2018 due primarily to decreased losses from the new economy skills training programs. Operating losses for the new economy skills training programs were $3.6 million and $16.7 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, including restructuring costs incurred in connection with the closing of Dev Bootcamp that was completed in the second half of 2017. Operating losses from the new economy skills training programs were $0.8 million and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding losses from the new economy skills training programs, KTP operating results were down in 2018, due primarily to revenue declines for classroom-based offerings. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) includes the domestic professional and other continuing education businesses. In 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, Kaplan Professional (U.S.) revenue was up 16% and 31%, respectively, due primarily to the May 2018 acquisition of Professional Publications, Inc. (PPI), an independent publisher of professional licensing exam review materials that provides engineering, surveying, architecture, and interior design licensure exam review products, and the July 2018 acquisition of College for Financial Planning (CFFP), a provider of financial education and training to individuals through programs of study for professionals pursuing a career in Financial Planning. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) operating results improved 4% in 2018, due mostly to income from PPI and CFFP, offset by increased spending on sales, marketing and technology. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) operating results improved 40% in the fourth quarter of 2018, due mostly to a delay in the CFA exam and registration dates in 2018. Kaplan corporate and other represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.’s corporate office, other minor businesses and certain shared activities. Television Broadcasting Revenue at the television broadcasting division increased 23% to $505.5 million in 2018, from $409.9 million in 2017. The revenue increase is due to a $64.9 million increase in political advertising revenue, $38.0 million in higher retransmission revenues, $8.6 million in 2018 incremental winter Olympics-related advertising revenue at the Company’s NBC stations, and the adverse impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2018 was up 51% to $210.5 million, from $139.3 million in 2017, due to higher revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue increased 37% to $152.6 million, from $111.0 million in 2017. The revenue increase is due to a $38.0 million increase in political advertising revenue and $10.9 million in higher retransmission revenues. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was up 86% to $73.4 million, from $39.5 million in the same period of 2017, due to higher revenues. In 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, the television broadcasting division recorded $3.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in reductions to operating expenses related to non-cash property, plant and equipment gains due to new equipment received at no cost in connection with the spectrum repacking mandate of the FCC. Manufacturing Manufacturing includes four businesses: Dekko, a manufacturer of electrical workspace solutions, architectural lighting and electrical components and assemblies; Joyce/Dayton Corp., a manufacturer of screw jacks and other linear motion systems; Forney, a global supplier of products and systems that control and monitor combustion processes in electric utility and industrial applications; and Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc., a supplier of pressure impregnated kiln-dried lumber and plywood products for fire retardant and preservative applications that the Company acquired in April 2017. In July 2018, Dekko acquired Furnlite, Inc., a Fallston, NC-based manufacturer of power and data solutions for the hospitality and residential furniture industries. Manufacturing revenues and operating income increased in 2018 due largely to the Hoover acquisition. Also, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $9.2 million goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge at Forney, due to lower than expected revenues resulting from sluggish overall demand for its energy products. Manufacturing operating income declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 due largely to a decline at Hoover. While Hoover holds inventory for relatively short periods, wood prices declined on a consistent basis in the second half of 2018, resulting in losses on inventory sales. Healthcare Graham Healthcare Group (GHG) provides home health and hospice services in three states. At the end of June 2017, GHG acquired Hometown Home Health and Hospice, a Lapeer, MI-based healthcare services provider. Healthcare revenues declined 3% in 2018, primarily due to a new management services agreement (MSA) with one of GHG’s joint ventures that was effective in the third quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, GHG recorded a $7.9 million intangible asset impairment charge related to the Celtic trademark, which was phased out in the second half of 2018. The decline in GHG operating results in 2018 is due to the intangible asset impairment charge and a decline in results from the MSA with one of GHG’s joint ventures, offset by lower bad debt expense and overall cost reductions. SocialCode SocialCode is a provider of marketing solutions on social, mobile and video platforms. In the third quarter of 2018, SocialCode acquired Marketplace Strategy, a Cleveland-based Amazon sales acceleration agency. SocialCode revenue decreased 5% in 2018 and 16% in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting from declines in digital advertising service revenues, partly due to a transition from agency-based clients to direct-relationship clients. SocialCode reported an operating loss of $1.1 million and $0.7 million in 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively, compared to an operating loss of $3.7 million and operating income of $4.5 million in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. SocialCode’s operating results included a credit of $7.1 million and expense of $0.1 million related to phantom equity plans in 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively; whereas 2017 results included expense of $1.4 million and $0.2 million related to phantom equity plans in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Excluding the amounts related to phantom equity plans for the relevant periods, SocialCode results are down in 2018, largely due to revenue declines. Other Businesses Other businesses include Slate and Foreign Policy, which publish online and print magazines and websites; and three investment stage businesses, Panoply, Pinna and CyberVista. Revenues increased 26% in 2018 and 80% for the fourth quarter of 2018, largely due to growth at Panoply. Losses from each of these businesses in 2018 adversely affected operating results. Corporate Office Corporate office includes the expenses of the Company’s corporate office and certain continuing obligations related to prior business dispositions. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates At December 31, 2018, the Company held interests in a number of home health and hospice joint ventures, and interests in several other affiliates. During 2017, the Company acquired an approximate 11% interest in Intersection Holdings, LLC, a company that provides digital marketing and advertising services and products for cities, transit systems, airports, and other public and private spaces. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded $7.9 million in gains in earnings of affiliates related to two of its investments. In total, the Company recorded equity in earnings of affiliates of $14.5 million for 2018, compared to losses of $3.2 million in 2017. Net Interest Expense, Debt Extinguishment Costs and Related Balances On May 30, 2018, the Company issued $400 million of 5.75% unsecured eight-year fixed-rate notes due June 1, 2026. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. On June 29, 2018, the Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and other cash to repay $400 million of 7.25% notes that were due February 1, 2019. The Company incurred $11.4 million in debt extinguishment costs related to the early termination of the 7.25% notes. The Company incurred net interest expense of $32.5 million in 2018, compared to $27.3 million in 2017; net interest expense totaled $5.1 million and $4.9 million for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company incurred $6.2 million in interest expense related to the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest at GHG settled in the second quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $477.1 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.1%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $778.7 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $493.3 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 6.3%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $964.7 million. Non-Operating Pension and Postretirement Benefit Income, Net In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that changes the income statement classification of net periodic pension and postretirement pension cost. Under the new guidance, service cost is included in operating income, while the other components (including expected return on assets) are included in non-operating income. The new guidance was required to be applied retroactively, with prior period financial information revised to reflect the reclassification. From a segment reporting perspective, this change had a significant impact on Corporate office reporting, with minimal impact on the television broadcasting and Kaplan corporate reporting. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $26.9 million gain related to a bulk lump sum pension program offering. Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company made changes to its postretirement healthcare benefit plan, resulting in a $3.4 million curtailment gain. In total, the Company recorded net non-operating pension and postretirement benefit income of $120.5 million in 2018, compared to $72.7 million in 2017. The Company recorded $53.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Loss on Marketable Equity Securities, Net In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new guidance that requires changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities to be included in non-operating income (expense) on a prospective basis. Overall, the Company recognized $15.8 million in net losses on marketable equity securities in 2018 and $44.1 million in net losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other Non-Operating Income (Expense) The Company recorded total other non-operating income, net, of $2.1 million in 2018, compared to $4.2 million in 2017. The 2018 non-operating income, net, included $11.7 million in fair value increases on cost method investments; $8.2 million in net gains related to sales of businesses and contingent consideration; a $2.8 million gain on sale of a cost method investment; a $2.5 million gain on sale of land and other items, partially offset by $17.5 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with the 2015 sale of the KHE Campuses businesses; $3.8 million in foreign currency losses; and $2.7 million in impairments on cost method investments. The 2017 non-operating income, net, included $3.3 million in foreign currency gains and other items. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded other non-operating expense, net, of $12.6 million, compared to $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2018 non-operating expense, net, included $13.3 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with the 2015 sale of the KHE Campuses businesses and $1.6 million in foreign currency losses and other items; partially offset by a $3.2 million fair value increase on cost method investments. The fourth quarter of 2017 non-operating expense, net, included $3.3 million in foreign currency losses offset by other items. Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was 16.1%. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $17.8 million deferred state tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances. Excluding this $17.8 million benefit and a $1.8 million income tax benefit related to stock compensation, the overall income tax rate for 2018 was 22.2%. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017, which included lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company reported an income tax benefit of $119.7 million for 2017, which was significantly impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Overall, the Company recorded a $177.5 million net deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of enactment of this legislation, due largely to the revaluation of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal tax rate and a significant reduction in the amount of deferred taxes previously provided on undistributed earnings of investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $5.9 million income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock awards in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires all excess income tax benefits and deficiencies from stock compensation to be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 34.9%. Earnings Per Share The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018 was based on 5,369,611 and 5,308,710 weighted average shares, respectively, compared to 5,552,163 and 5,508,530 weighted average shares, respectively, for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017. At December 31, 2018, there were 5,300,959 shares outstanding. On November 9, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire up to 500,000 shares of Class B common stock; the Company has remaining authorization for 273,655 shares as of December 31, 2018. Adoption of Revenue Recognition Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance using the modified retrospective approach. In connection with the KU Transaction, Kaplan recognized $4.5 million in service fee revenue and operating income in the third quarter of 2018. Under the previous guidance, this would not have been recognized, as a determination would not have been made until the end of Purdue Global’s fiscal year (June 30, 2019). If the company applied the accounting policies under the previous guidance for all other revenue streams, revenue and operating expenses would have been $1.7 million and $0.6 million lower, respectively, for 2018.

Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) includes Kaplan’s standardized test preparation programs. In September 2018, KTP acquired the test preparation and study guide assets of Barron’s Educational Series, a New York-based education publishing company. KTP revenue declined 6% in 2018 due to reduced demand for classroom-based offerings, and the disposition of Dev Bootcamp, which made up the majority of KTP’s new economy skills training programs, offset in part by growth in online-based programs. Revenues were flat for the fourth quarter of 2018. Excluding revenues from the Barron’s acquisition, revenues were down 5% for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to declines in demand for classroom-based offerings, offset in part by growth in online-based programs. KTP operating results improved in 2018 due primarily to decreased losses from the new economy skills training programs. Operating losses for the new economy skills training programs were $3.6 million and $16.7 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively, including restructuring costs incurred in connection with the closing of Dev Bootcamp that was completed in the second half of 2017. Operating losses from the new economy skills training programs were $0.8 million and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Excluding losses from the new economy skills training programs, KTP operating results were down in 2018, due primarily to revenue declines for classroom-based offerings. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) includes the domestic professional and other continuing education businesses. In 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, Kaplan Professional (U.S.) revenue was up 16% and 31%, respectively, due primarily to the May 2018 acquisition of Professional Publications, Inc. (PPI), an independent publisher of professional licensing exam review materials that provides engineering, surveying, architecture, and interior design licensure exam review products, and the July 2018 acquisition of College for Financial Planning (CFFP), a provider of financial education and training to individuals through programs of study for professionals pursuing a career in Financial Planning. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) operating results improved 4% in 2018, due mostly to income from PPI and CFFP, offset by increased spending on sales, marketing and technology. Kaplan Professional (U.S.) operating results improved 40% in the fourth quarter of 2018, due mostly to a delay in the CFA exam and registration dates in 2018. Kaplan corporate and other represents unallocated expenses of Kaplan, Inc.’s corporate office, other minor businesses and certain shared activities. Television Broadcasting Revenue at the television broadcasting division increased 23% to $505.5 million in 2018, from $409.9 million in 2017. The revenue increase is due to a $64.9 million increase in political advertising revenue, $38.0 million in higher retransmission revenues, $8.6 million in 2018 incremental winter Olympics-related advertising revenue at the Company’s NBC stations, and the adverse impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter of 2017. Operating income for 2018 was up 51% to $210.5 million, from $139.3 million in 2017, due to higher revenues. For the fourth quarter of 2018, revenue increased 37% to $152.6 million, from $111.0 million in 2017. The revenue increase is due to a $38.0 million increase in political advertising revenue and $10.9 million in higher retransmission revenues. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was up 86% to $73.4 million, from $39.5 million in the same period of 2017, due to higher revenues. In 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, the television broadcasting division recorded $3.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in reductions to operating expenses related to non-cash property, plant and equipment gains due to new equipment received at no cost in connection with the spectrum repacking mandate of the FCC. Manufacturing Manufacturing includes four businesses: Dekko, a manufacturer of electrical workspace solutions, architectural lighting and electrical components and assemblies; Joyce/Dayton Corp., a manufacturer of screw jacks and other linear motion systems; Forney, a global supplier of products and systems that control and monitor combustion processes in electric utility and industrial applications; and Hoover Treated Wood Products, Inc., a supplier of pressure impregnated kiln-dried lumber and plywood products for fire retardant and preservative applications that the Company acquired in April 2017. In July 2018, Dekko acquired Furnlite, Inc., a Fallston, NC-based manufacturer of power and data solutions for the hospitality and residential furniture industries. Manufacturing revenues and operating income increased in 2018 due largely to the Hoover acquisition. Also, in the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $9.2 million goodwill and other long-lived asset impairment charge at Forney, due to lower than expected revenues resulting from sluggish overall demand for its energy products. Manufacturing operating income declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 due largely to a decline at Hoover. While Hoover holds inventory for relatively short periods, wood prices declined on a consistent basis in the second half of 2018, resulting in losses on inventory sales. Healthcare Graham Healthcare Group (GHG) provides home health and hospice services in three states. At the end of June 2017, GHG acquired Hometown Home Health and Hospice, a Lapeer, MI-based healthcare services provider. Healthcare revenues declined 3% in 2018, primarily due to a new management services agreement (MSA) with one of GHG’s joint ventures that was effective in the third quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, GHG recorded a $7.9 million intangible asset impairment charge related to the Celtic trademark, which was phased out in the second half of 2018. The decline in GHG operating results in 2018 is due to the intangible asset impairment charge and a decline in results from the MSA with one of GHG’s joint ventures, offset by lower bad debt expense and overall cost reductions. SocialCode SocialCode is a provider of marketing solutions on social, mobile and video platforms. In the third quarter of 2018, SocialCode acquired Marketplace Strategy, a Cleveland-based Amazon sales acceleration agency. SocialCode revenue decreased 5% in 2018 and 16% in the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting from declines in digital advertising service revenues, partly due to a transition from agency-based clients to direct-relationship clients. SocialCode reported an operating loss of $1.1 million and $0.7 million in 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively, compared to an operating loss of $3.7 million and operating income of $4.5 million in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. SocialCode’s operating results included a credit of $7.1 million and expense of $0.1 million related to phantom equity plans in 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively; whereas 2017 results included expense of $1.4 million and $0.2 million related to phantom equity plans in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Excluding the amounts related to phantom equity plans for the relevant periods, SocialCode results are down in 2018, largely due to revenue declines. Other Businesses Other businesses include Slate and Foreign Policy, which publish online and print magazines and websites; and three investment stage businesses, Panoply, Pinna and CyberVista. Revenues increased 26% in 2018 and 80% for the fourth quarter of 2018, largely due to growth at Panoply. Losses from each of these businesses in 2018 adversely affected operating results. Corporate Office Corporate office includes the expenses of the Company’s corporate office and certain continuing obligations related to prior business dispositions. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates At December 31, 2018, the Company held interests in a number of home health and hospice joint ventures, and interests in several other affiliates. During 2017, the Company acquired an approximate 11% interest in Intersection Holdings, LLC, a company that provides digital marketing and advertising services and products for cities, transit systems, airports, and other public and private spaces. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded $7.9 million in gains in earnings of affiliates related to two of its investments. In total, the Company recorded equity in earnings of affiliates of $14.5 million for 2018, compared to losses of $3.2 million in 2017. Net Interest Expense, Debt Extinguishment Costs and Related Balances On May 30, 2018, the Company issued $400 million of 5.75% unsecured eight-year fixed-rate notes due June 1, 2026. Interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. On June 29, 2018, the Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and other cash to repay $400 million of 7.25% notes that were due February 1, 2019. The Company incurred $11.4 million in debt extinguishment costs related to the early termination of the 7.25% notes. The Company incurred net interest expense of $32.5 million in 2018, compared to $27.3 million in 2017; net interest expense totaled $5.1 million and $4.9 million for the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company incurred $6.2 million in interest expense related to the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest at GHG settled in the second quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2018, the Company had $477.1 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.1%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $778.7 million. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $493.3 million in borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of 6.3%, and cash, marketable securities and other investments of $964.7 million. Non-Operating Pension and Postretirement Benefit Income, Net In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new accounting guidance that changes the income statement classification of net periodic pension and postretirement pension cost. Under the new guidance, service cost is included in operating income, while the other components (including expected return on assets) are included in non-operating income. The new guidance was required to be applied retroactively, with prior period financial information revised to reflect the reclassification. From a segment reporting perspective, this change had a significant impact on Corporate office reporting, with minimal impact on the television broadcasting and Kaplan corporate reporting. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $26.9 million gain related to a bulk lump sum pension program offering. Also in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company made changes to its postretirement healthcare benefit plan, resulting in a $3.4 million curtailment gain. In total, the Company recorded net non-operating pension and postretirement benefit income of $120.5 million in 2018, compared to $72.7 million in 2017. The Company recorded $53.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Loss on Marketable Equity Securities, Net In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted new guidance that requires changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities to be included in non-operating income (expense) on a prospective basis. Overall, the Company recognized $15.8 million in net losses on marketable equity securities in 2018 and $44.1 million in net losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. Other Non-Operating Income (Expense) The Company recorded total other non-operating income, net, of $2.1 million in 2018, compared to $4.2 million in 2017. The 2018 non-operating income, net, included $11.7 million in fair value increases on cost method investments; $8.2 million in net gains related to sales of businesses and contingent consideration; a $2.8 million gain on sale of a cost method investment; a $2.5 million gain on sale of land and other items, partially offset by $17.5 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with the 2015 sale of the KHE Campuses businesses; $3.8 million in foreign currency losses; and $2.7 million in impairments on cost method investments. The 2017 non-operating income, net, included $3.3 million in foreign currency gains and other items. For the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded other non-operating expense, net, of $12.6 million, compared to $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The 2018 non-operating expense, net, included $13.3 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with the 2015 sale of the KHE Campuses businesses and $1.6 million in foreign currency losses and other items; partially offset by a $3.2 million fair value increase on cost method investments. The fourth quarter of 2017 non-operating expense, net, included $3.3 million in foreign currency losses offset by other items. Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 was 16.1%. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $17.8 million deferred state tax benefit related to the release of valuation allowances. Excluding this $17.8 million benefit and a $1.8 million income tax benefit related to stock compensation, the overall income tax rate for 2018 was 22.2%. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in December 2017, which included lowering the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company reported an income tax benefit of $119.7 million for 2017, which was significantly impacted by the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Overall, the Company recorded a $177.5 million net deferred tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of enactment of this legislation, due largely to the revaluation of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal tax rate and a significant reduction in the amount of deferred taxes previously provided on undistributed earnings of investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $5.9 million income tax benefit related to the vesting of restricted stock awards in connection with the adoption of a new accounting standard that requires all excess income tax benefits and deficiencies from stock compensation to be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes. Excluding the effect of these items, the effective tax rate for 2017 was 34.9%. Earnings Per Share The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2018 was based on 5,369,611 and 5,308,710 weighted average shares, respectively, compared to 5,552,163 and 5,508,530 weighted average shares, respectively, for 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017. At December 31, 2018, there were 5,300,959 shares outstanding. On November 9, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to acquire up to 500,000 shares of Class B common stock; the Company has remaining authorization for 273,655 shares as of December 31, 2018. Adoption of Revenue Recognition Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition guidance using the modified retrospective approach. In connection with the KU Transaction, Kaplan recognized $4.5 million in service fee revenue and operating income in the third quarter of 2018. Under the previous guidance, this would not have been recognized, as a determination would not have been made until the end of Purdue Global’s fiscal year (June 30, 2019). If the company applied the accounting policies under the previous guidance for all other revenue streams, revenue and operating expenses would have been $1.7 million and $0.6 million lower, respectively, for 2018.

The new law was originally expected to give around 2,000 felons the right to vote, but now advocates are saying that number could be much higher.“This law is very important to me that now my little grand-daughter can say, ‘my paw-paw can vote,’"" Checo Yancy said.Yancy is one of possibly thousands of former prisoners expected to regain their right to vote. Although, it’s not quite clear yet as to how many of those previously convicted felons in Louisiana will regain the right to vote in upcoming elections.“I believe this law is going to effect more like 36,000 people based on the numbers from the department of corrections,” local criminal defense attorney, Adam Johnson said.Louisiana has the highest rate of incarceration nationwide and the highest numbers of families directly impacted by criminal convictions. Last year, Governor Edwards signed House Bill 265 into law with the intent to:The voting rights law the legislature approved last May was discussed Feb. 15 during a meeting of the House and Governmental Affairs Committee.It requires the people on probation and parole who want to vote to complete a specific form that isn’t available yet and have it signed by a probation and parole officer. They will then need to take that form in person to the local registrar of voters.“It’s greater than just the fact that they’re allowed to get their voting rights back. I think it shows that there is greater criminal justice reform,” local criminal defense attorney, Shane Hinch said.Hinch said the change is definitely a step in the right direction, but will definitely present some challenges.“On March first when this goes into effect, I’m worried that there might be some hiccups and them actually being able to do it. The law says they can, but the implementation could be cumbersome and that’s how it’s going to be in any legislative process,” Hinch said.Currently, more than 70,000 Louisiana residents are on probation or parole for felony crimes.Yancy who advocates on behalf of formerly incarcerated individuals attended the hearing Friday, detailing the new law.“You hear all the time about returning to citizen and people coming back to the community, but you’re not a part of the community.

The same year, my mother and I had just immigrated to the United States in search of a better life. Like that day 30 years ago, today the pledge still does not speak to me or even encourage patriotic introspection. It’s not due to a lack of appreciation for my new homeland, however. The pledge’s history is deeply rooted in nativism and white supremacy. Composed in 1892 by the minister Francis Bellamy, the pledge sought to define “true Americanism” that didn’t include people of color and immigrants particularly those coming from southern and eastern Europe. At worst, the pledge’s disturbing history excludes countless communities, including my own family. At best, reciting the pledge has become a perfunctory exercise of rote memorization.Our pledge of allegiance should be rooted in optimism, not stem from the fear of a white native-born Protestant culture. It is time to upgrade our pledge so we can truly recite words that live up to a nation that takes pride in our immigrant heritage and equality of all Americans. The original pledge was drafted as a generic template that could be used by any country. In its earliest form it simply read: ""I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.”In 1923 and 1954, the words, ""the Flag of the United States of America"" and ""under God"" were added, respectively, creating the 31-word pledge we say today. Amending the Constitution is a difficult political and procedural endeavor. However, upgrading our expression to our country and each other should not be. The upgraded version should read: “I pledge allegiance and love to our indigenous and immigrant heritage, rooted in the United States of America, to our civil rights for which we strive, one voice, one nation, for equality and justice for all.”Inserting the word “love” in the upgraded pledge anchors us to a genuine patriotic affection for civic virtue, collaboration and respect for each other. This is a sharp contrast to the past and current misguided nationalism that very often breeds cultural, religious and ethnic intolerance.Faced with an unceasing wave of xenophobia and discrimination against native Americans, we need to constantly remind ourselves that the United States is at its best when we embrace our immigrant and indigenous heritage.White teenagers harassing a Native American elder or chanting “build the wall” at Mexican immigrants are not isolated incidents. Incorporating “our indigenous and immigrant heritage” is our pledge that we will pro-actively counter the danger that racism breeds. Similarly, protecting civil rights is an essential part of the democratic values of our nation. Expressly outlining a commitment to “our civil rights” is an acknowledgment to the movements that have and will continue to fight for our liberties.The phrases “one voice” and “equality” represent today’s reality that our neighborhoods are more than ever interwoven with people from every part of the globe. With almost every language spoken and religion, ethnicity present in our neighborhoods, the U.S. is the cultural capital of the world. Nevertheless, we are bound not by language, racial or ethnic ties, but by a vocal and legal commitment that every American stands as equal regardless of their immigration status, religion, sexual orientation, gender, race, disability and so on.And finally, we should also upgrade the way we express our pledge. We should face the flag and face each other. Not only are we represented by the red, white, and blue but also by the colors of the world.  Pledging allegiance to each other upholds the fundamental words of the Declaration of Independence of mutually pledging “to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor”.

We are once again confronted with global instability, xenophobia, discrimination, destructive climate change, income inequality.

28,Alternative Energy vs. Fossil Fuels,Can Alternative Energy Effectively Replace Fossil Fuels?,2s28q2r,https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/2/7/18211709/green-new-deal-resolution-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-markey,The Green New Deal: Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduce resolution - Vox,"A close look at the fights it picks and the fights it avoids.The Green New Deal has become an incredibly hot item on the political agenda, but to date, it has remained somewhat ill defined. It’s a broad enough concept that everyone can read their aspirations into it, which has been part of its strength, but it has also left discussion in something of a fog, since no one’s quite sure what they’re arguing about. On Thursday, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced a Green New Deal resolution that lays out the goals, aspirations, and specifics of the program in a more definitive way. This is as close as there is to an “official” Green New Deal — at last, something to argue about.There will be lots to say in the days to come about the politics of all this. (In the meantime, read Ella Nilsen’s piece.) For instance, it is interesting that Markey, a living symbol of 2008-era Democratic thinking on climate change (and the leader of the old climate committee), is lending his imprimatur to this more urgent and radical iteration. Related But for now, I just want to share a few initial impressions after reading through the short document a few times.It’s worth noting just what a high-wire act the authors of this resolution are attempting. It has to offer enough specifics to give it real shape and ambition, without overprescribing solutions or prejudging differences over secondary questions. It has to please a diverse range of interest groups, from environmental justice to labor to climate, without alienating any of them. It has to stand up to intense scrutiny (much of it sure to be bad faith), with lots of people gunning for it from both the right and center.And, of course, it eventually has to give birth to real legislation.Given all those demands, the resolution does a remarkably good job of threading the needle. It is bold and unmistakably progressive, matched to the problem as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while avoiding a few needless fights and leaving room for plenty of debate over priorities and policy tools. The resolution consists of a preamble, five goals, 14 projects, and 15 requirements. The preamble establishes that there are two crises, a climate crisis and an economic crisis of wage stagnation and growing inequality, and that the GND can address both.The goals — achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs, providing for a just transition, securing clean air and water — are broadly popular. The projects — things like decarbonizing electricity, transportation, and industry, restoring ecosystems, upgrading buildings and electricity grids — are necessary and sensible (if also extremely ambitious). There are a few items down in the requirements that might raise red flags (more on those later), but given the long road ahead, there will be plenty of time to sort them out. Overall, this is about as strong an opening bid as anyone could have asked for.Now let’s take a closer look. From a progressive point of view, the discussion over climate change in the US has always been overly skewed toward technologies and markets. (The term of art is “neoliberalism.”) I have been guilty of this myself. Economics and technology are considered serious topics in the US, a ticket to being heard and acknowledged by the political mainstream, and there is a subtle, tidal pressure to hew to those subjects, at risk of being relegated to the status of activist or, worse yet, ideologue. (As though neoliberalism is not an ideology.) The resurgent left is done with all that. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with technologies or markets, as long as they remain servants, not masters. It’s just that in the US, those subjects have tended to occlude deeper and more urgent considerations (like justice) and exclude a wide range of policy instruments (like public investment). It is for the progressive movement to stand up for those priorities, and that’s what the GND resolution does. We’ll take them in turn.1) JusticeOrdinary people matter. Emissions matter, yes. Costs and money matter. Technologies and policies matter. But they all matter secondarily, via their effects on ordinary people. The role of progressive politics, if it amounts to anything, is to center the safety, health, and dignity of ordinary people.That means that justice — or as it’s often called, “environmental justice,” as though it’s some boutique subgenre — must be at the heart of any plan to address climate change. The simple fact is that climate change will hit what the resolution calls “frontline and vulnerable communities” (who have contributed least to the problem) hardest. And attempts to transition away from fossil fuels threaten communities that remain tied to the fossil fuel economy. Frontline and vulnerable communities stand to get it coming and going, from the problem and from the solutions. And unlike big energy companies pursuing growth, unlike idle billionaires fascinated with new tech, unlike banks and financial institutions seeking out new income streams, unlike incumbent industries fat from decades of subsidies, frontline and vulnerable communities do not have the means to fund campaigns and hire expensive lobbyists. They do not have the means to make their voice heard in the scrum of politics.That’s why progressives exist: to amplify the voices of those without power (a class that includes future generations).Accordingly, in the resolution’s preamble — the part with all the whereas this and whereas that — there are three statements focused on climate damages and emissions and four focused, in one way or another, on justice. Of the resolution’s five goals, three are focused on justice. (For example: “promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression to frontline and vulnerable communities.”)Of the 12 GND projects, three, including the very first, are focused on community-level resilience and development. And something like two-thirds of the GND requirements, depending on how you count, direct political power and public investment down to the state, local, and worker level, safeguarding environmental and labor standards and prioritizing family-wage jobs.The resolution makes clear that justice is a top progressive priority. It is fashionable for centrists and some climate wonks to dismiss things like wage standards as tertiary, a way of piggybacking liberal goals onto the climate fight. But progressives don’t see it that way. In a period of massive, rapid disruption, the welfare of the people involved is not tertiary.2) InvestmentNeoliberalism has also made old-fashioned public investment something of a taboo. The GND goes directly at it — public investment aimed at creating jobs is central to the project. The preamble notes that “the Federal Government-led mobilizations during World War II and the New Deal era created the greatest middle class that the US has ever seen” and frames the GND as “a historic opportunity to create millions of good, high-wage jobs in the United States.”Creating jobs is the second of the five goals; investment in “US infrastructure and industry” is the third. Of the GND projects, investment in “community-defined projects and strategies” to increase resilience is the first; repairing and upgrading infrastructure is the second. Of the GND requirements, the very first is “providing and leveraging, in a way that ensures that the public receives appropriate ownership stakes and returns on investment, adequate capital (including through community grants, public banks, and other public financing), technical expertise, supporting policies, and other forms of assistance to communities, organizations, Federal, State, and local government agencies, and businesses working on the Green New Deal mobilization.”Also in the requirements: funding education and job training for frontline communities in transition; investing in research and development; and investing in community ownership and resilience.Public investment with the returns going back to the public — it’s not a GND without that. There some internecine fights within the broad community of climate hawks that are best left to other venues, in order to keep the coalition behind a GND as broad and small-c catholic as possible. This resolution deftly avoids several of those fights.1) Paying for itThe question of how to pay for the many public investments called for in the GND is still a bit of a political minefield. There are centrist Democrats who still believe in the old PAYGO rules, keeping a “balanced budget” within a 10-year window. There are Democrats who think deficit fears have been exaggerated and there’s nothing wrong with running a deficit to drive an economic transition. And there are Democrats who have gone full Modern Monetary Theory, which is way too complicated to explain here but amounts to the notion that, short of inflation, the level of the deficit is effectively irrelevant, as long as we’re getting the economy we want.That discussion is just getting underway, and the better part of valor is to do what the GND resolution does: say nothing about it. Leave it for later.2) Clean versus renewable energyMany, probably most, climate hawks would prefer a future in which all electricity is provided by renewable energy. (I am among them.) But there is good-faith disagreement about whether 100 percent renewables is realistic or economical in the 10-year time frame. Many, probably most energy analysts believe that renewables will need to be supplemented with nuclear power or fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), but some lefty environmental groups pushed for the GND to explicitly prohibit them.As I argued earlier, that would have caused a completely unnecessary fight. The resolution wisely avoids taking that route.Instead, it calls for the US to “meet 100 percent of our power demand through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.”Easy. Now renewables advocates can go right on advocating for renewables, nuclear fans can go right on advocating for nuclear, and they can continue fighting it out on Twitter. But their fight doesn’t need to muck up the GND. The GND targets carbon emissions, which is the right target for a broad programmatic outline.3) Carbon pricingCarbon pricing — carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems — is also the source of much agita within the climate hawk community. The need to price carbon has practically been climate orthodoxy for the past few decades, but lately there’s been something of a lefty backlash. Some have taken the (sensible) position that climate pricing has been rather fetishized, that it may not be the smartest political priority in all cases, and that other policy instruments with more proven records are equally important. Some have taken the (silly) position that carbon pricing is bad or counterproductive in and of itself and pushed to have it excluded from the GND.The resolution doesn’t take a position. It merely says that the GND must involve “accounting for the true cost of emissions.” If you’re a carbon pricing fan (as I am), you can read pricing into that. But there are other ways to read it too.Pricing advocates probably would have liked something a little more muscular there, but in the end, I think the instinct — to avoid the fight entirely — is the right one. The struggle over how or whether to prioritize pricing instruments can come later; it doesn’t need to be settled in advance of getting people on board with the GND.4) Supply-side policyLately, lots of climate activists have been pushing to directly restrict the supply and distribution of fossil fuels — at the mine, well, or import terminal — with an eye toward phasing out fossil fuels entirely. “Keep it in the ground,” as the slogan goes.This is the leading edge of the climate fight, out ahead of where labor and most moderates are. Including it in the GND probably would have sparked some defections.The GND resolution doesn’t touch the subject, other than calling for transition assistance for communities losing fossil fuel jobs. And it calls on the US to “achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions,” which theoretically allows for some fossil fuel combustion coupled with carbon removal. The keep-it-in-the-ground crowd is in the same position as the all-renewables crowd: They may feel some initial disappointment that their perspective was not reflected in the resolution, but they can take comfort in the fact that it was not excluded either. The resolution simply slates that fight as something to take place within the broad GND coalition, rather than making it part of the price of membership. All four of these omissions or elisions — these fights postponed — signal, to me, a movement that is capable of reining in its more vigorous ideological impulses in the name of building the broadest possible left coalition behind an ambitious climate solution. That bodes well.There are a few things I would have liked to see feature more prominently in the resolution. They are somewhat nerdy, but important in climate policy.1) Density and public spaceJust about the only urban-focused element of the GND resolution is tucked into the transportation section, calling for “investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing, clean, affordable, and accessible public transit, and high-speed rail.”That’s it. Boo. Creating dense urban areas with ample public spaces and multimodal transportation options — deprioritizing private automobiles and reducing overall automobile traffic — serves multiple progressive goals. It tackles the next big climate challenge, which is cars. It reduces urban air pollution, urban noise, and the urban heat island effect, while increasing physical activity and social contact, all of which improves the physical and psychological health of urban communities.It addresses the housing crisis that is crippling many growing cities, pricing young people, poor people, students, and longtime residents out of walkable urban cores. And, if you will forgive some dreamy speculation, a little more public space might just generate a sense of community and social solidarity to counteract the segregation, atomization, isolation, and mutual distrust that cars and suburbs have exacerbated.I get that GND proponents are spooked about being seen as anti-rural, which is why these kinds of plans from the left always include education, training, and transition assistance for rural communities hurt by decarbonization. And that’s great. But they should also remember that their core demographics live in cities and are engaged in urban issues. Cities are central to any vision of 21st-century sustainability. They deserve pride of place in a GND.2) ElectrificationIt is widely acknowledged in the climate policy community that deep decarbonization will involve rapid and substantial electrification. We know how to decarbonize electricity grids — so we need to get everything we can onto the grid.That means two big things in particular.First, the US vehicle fleet needs to be electrified as fast as practicably possible. The resolution’s “investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure” hints at this, but scarcely conveys the needed scale and speed.Second, the millions upon millions of buildings in the US that use natural gas for heat need to find a zero-carbon alternative, and quickly. There are some zero-carbon liquid substitute fuels on the horizon, but for the time being, the best way we know to decarbonize HVAC (heating, ventilation, and cooling) is to rip out all those millions of furnaces and replace them with electric heat pumps. That’s a big, big job that will create a ton of work and directly involve millions of people’s homes and businesses.The GND resolution would “upgrade all existing U.S. buildings and build new buildings, to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability.” Theoretically that could imply electrification, but I’d like to see it called out. [UPDATE February 7, 2019: In between the leaked copy and the final resolution, a single phrase was added to the sentence quoted above: “including through electrification.” They’re reading my mind!]As I said, most of the resolution consists of goals and policies that anyone who takes climate change seriously will find necessary. But down toward the bottom of the list of projects, the resolution really lets its hair down and gets funky. Readers who make it that far into the document will find some eyebrow-raising doozies. Like No. 8: “guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and disability leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States.” Heyo! There’s that job guarantee. Or No. 9: “strengthening and protecting the right of all workers to organize, unionize, and collectively bargain free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment.” A full-on right to unionize, okay.11: “enacting and enforcing trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments with strong labor and environmental protections to stop the transfer of jobs and pollution overseas and to grow domestic manufacturing in the United States.” And there’s a liberal trade regime.14: “ensuring a commercial environment where every businessperson is free from unfair competition and domination by domestic or international monopolies.” All right, we’re going after monopolies too.And just to fill in the remaining gaps, 15: “providing all members of society with high-quality health care, affordable, safe and adequate housing, economic security, and access to clean water, air, healthy and affordable food, and nature.” That is quite the addendum!If you’re keeping score at home, the Green New Deal now involves a federal job guarantee, the right to unionize, liberal trade and monopoly policies, and universal housing and health care. This is just a resolution, not legislation. (I’m pretty sure providing universal housing and health care would require a couple of bills at least.) So I’m not really sure how literally these latter requirements are meant to be read, or how literally those who sign on to the GND will take them. If they’re taken literally, then everyone who signs on should get a welcome letter from the Democratic Socialists of America. If they are taken as an aspirational list of Good Things, as I suspect they will be (especially given Markey’s involvement), then many arguments will remain to be had about just what a GND endorsement means. But it definitely means something.“The Green New Deal is what it means to be progressive. Clean air, clean water, decarbonizing, green jobs, a just transition, and environmental justice are what it means to a progressive,” Sean McElwee said. He’s the director of Data Progress, a young think tank whose work has substantially informed the GND. “By definition that means politicians who don’t support those goals aren’t progressive. We need to hold that line. Get on the GND train or choo-choo, motherfucker, we’re going to go right past you.” Choo-choo, indeed. As I said in my first post on the Sunrise Movement protest that got the GND train rolling, I think it is all to the good that a muscular progressive movement is rallying behind a program shaped by the problem at hand rather than speculation about what is politically possible. It is good to start from a position of strength.And just to be clear, I’m a big fan of universal housing and health care. But at some point, we have to grapple with the fact that a solution to climate change will require the support of people who may not be ready to join the democratic socialist revolution. Given the two-year time window to get legislation ready and the 10-year time window to kickstart multiple decarbonization revolutions, the chances of pulling off a full-scale political revolution beforehand seem remote. So there will be a lot of bargaining ahead and some of the dreamier GND requirements will go overboard for the time being. Perhaps universal health care will have to be tackled separately. But take a step back and appreciate: The progressive movement has, in rather short order, thrust into mainstream US politics a program to address climate change that is wildly more ambitious than anything the Democratic Party was talking about even two years ago. One hundred percent clean energy, investment in new jobs, and a just transition have gone from activist dreams to the core of the Democratic agenda in the blink of a political eye. There’s a long way to go, but the GND train has come farther, faster than anyone could have predicted. “We are going to transition this country into the future and we are not going to be dragged behind by our past,” Ocasio-Cortez said at the press conference Thursday.With Trump and his attendant chaos, US politics is more disrupted, uncertain, and malleable than it’s been in my adult lifetime. Everything is up for grabs. The forces of ethnonationalism and fossil fuel myopia sense this malleability and are organizing to drag the country backward. But the malleability can serve a humane progressive agenda as well; progressives just have to organize better.The map has been drawn, the path laid out.

The Green New Deal: Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduce resolution - Vox A close look at the fights it picks and the fights it avoids.The Green New Deal has become an incredibly hot item on the political agenda, but to date, it has remained somewhat ill defined. It’s a broad enough concept that everyone can read their aspirations into it, which has been part of its strength, but it has also left discussion in something of a fog, since no one’s quite sure what they’re arguing about. On Thursday, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) introduced a Green New Deal resolution that lays out the goals, aspirations, and specifics of the program in a more definitive way. This is as close as there is to an “official” Green New Deal — at last, something to argue about.There will be lots to say in the days to come about the politics of all this. (In the meantime, read Ella Nilsen’s piece.) For instance, it is interesting that Markey, a living symbol of 2008-era Democratic thinking on climate change (and the leader of the old climate committee), is lending his imprimatur to this more urgent and radical iteration. Related But for now, I just want to share a few initial impressions after reading through the short document a few times.It’s worth noting just what a high-wire act the authors of this resolution are attempting. It has to offer enough specifics to give it real shape and ambition, without overprescribing solutions or prejudging differences over secondary questions. It has to please a diverse range of interest groups, from environmental justice to labor to climate, without alienating any of them. It has to stand up to intense scrutiny (much of it sure to be bad faith), with lots of people gunning for it from both the right and center.And, of course, it eventually has to give birth to real legislation.Given all those demands, the resolution does a remarkably good job of threading the needle. It is bold and unmistakably progressive, matched to the problem as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, while avoiding a few needless fights and leaving room for plenty of debate over priorities and policy tools. The resolution consists of a preamble, five goals, 14 projects, and 15 requirements. The preamble establishes that there are two crises, a climate crisis and an economic crisis of wage stagnation and growing inequality, and that the GND can address both.The goals — achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs, providing for a just transition, securing clean air and water — are broadly popular. The projects — things like decarbonizing electricity, transportation, and industry, restoring ecosystems, upgrading buildings and electricity grids — are necessary and sensible (if also extremely ambitious). There are a few items down in the requirements that might raise red flags (more on those later), but given the long road ahead, there will be plenty of time to sort them out. Overall, this is about as strong an opening bid as anyone could have asked for.Now let’s take a closer look.

But take a step back and appreciate: The progressive movement has, in rather short order, thrust into mainstream US politics a program to address climate change that is wildly more ambitious than anything the Democratic Party was talking about even two years ago. One hundred percent clean energy, investment in new jobs, and a just transition have gone from activist dreams to the core of the Democratic agenda in the blink of a political eye. There’s a long way to go, but the GND train has come farther, faster than anyone could have predicted. “We are going to transition this country into the future and we are not going to be dragged behind by our past,” Ocasio-Cortez said at the press conference Thursday.With Trump and his attendant chaos, US politics is more disrupted, uncertain, and malleable than it’s been in my adult lifetime. Everything is up for grabs. The forces of ethnonationalism and fossil fuel myopia sense this malleability and are organizing to drag the country backward. But the malleability can serve a humane progressive agenda as well; progressives just have to organize better.The map has been drawn, the path laid out. Now it’s on.The news, but shorter, delivered straight to your inbox.",3426,3408

However, The consequences greatly outweigh the benefits and therefore they should not be allowed at any level.The first problem with legalizing PEDs is the health risks.

Someone who chooses to take these drugs is asking for health problems in the present and in the future.Not only are they risking their athletic career, but also their overall well-being for the need to get a leg up on the competition. Why should the choice of harming themselves be given to athletes? Plus, if most athletes are deciding to use steroids, then many of the players who do not wish to suffer from the long-term effects will feel coerced into using illegal substances themselves. This could result in them slowly killing themselves in order to stay at the new competitive level set by the steroid users.Another problem is legalizing steroids will not keep players from getting a leg up. It will only increase the problem. If athletes are legally allowed to take a specific amount of drugs, for example, who’s to stop them from illegally taking even more? At this point, it becomes an endless cycle of athletes taking more and more to try to stay ahead of the competition.ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENTLet’s not forget about the kids, the ones who grow up watching their favorite athletes.

Most people know the old saying, “It’s not about if you win or lose, but about how you played the game.” PEDs devalue the underlying meaning of that statement because it centers everything around just the opposite: winning and losing.

30,Net Neutrality,Should Net Neutrality Be Restored?,2s30q10r,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/net-neutrality-oral-argument-shaping-up-as-epic-battle,Net Neutrality Oral Argument Shaping Up as Epic Battle - Broadcasting & Cable,"The Feb. 1 oral argument in the legal challenge to the FCC's Restoring Internet Freedom (RIF) net neutrality rule deregulation order (the case is Mozilla Corp. V. FCC) is going to be an epic event, at least in terms of the time allotted for both sides to make their cases. It is the only case slated for argument that day.It will also be streamed live on the court Web site, as has been the case with oral arguments in the circuit since last fall. The FCC and those challenging its Restoring Internet Freedom order teamed up to jointly ask the court for 75 minutes apiece (with rebuttal time included), divided among various attorneys arguing different issues. The court accepted the proposal and, if past is prologue, the argument will be even longer than those two and a half hours--judges usually allow some flexibility in individual time allocations and push the time limits with their own questions.By contrast to that 150 minutes, most arguments are only scheduled for between 20 minutes and an hour--though, again, often pushing beyond those limits, and the court usually gets through two or three cases in a morning.A veteran attorney who has argued before the court called that 150-minute marathon ""very rare, but not unprecedented.""The three-judge panel hearing the case comprises Judges Robert Wilkins, Patricia Millett and Stephen Williams, with Millett presiding. While Judge Judith Rogers was initially to preside, she dropped off the panel, replaced by Wilkens. One difference between Rogers and Millett said a veteran attorney, is that while Rogers is pretty much a by-the-book stickler for holding the parties to their time limits, Millett is looser with those limits.Back in May 2017, Williams was one of three judges, and the senior judge among those, who denied a petition by ISPs and others for en banc (full court) review of the earlier three-judge panel decision that the FCC had reasonably defended its decision to reclassify ISPs as Title II common carriers in the 2015 Open Internet order. Here, according to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, is how the Mozilla v. FCC argument will play out beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Friday.In this Corner: On one side are the petitioners--the companies and groups challenging the FCC order: Mozilla, Vimeo, Public Knowledge, Open Technology Institute, National Hispanic Media Coalition, NTCH, Benton Foundation, Free Press, Coalition for Internet Openness, Etsy, Ad Hoc Telecom Users Committee, Center for Democracy and Technology, INCOMPAS (the non-government petitioners); the States of New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, the District of Columbia, the County of Santa Clara, Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission (the local government challenging the order). There are also intervenors, which are  parties to the suit in support of the challenge.In that corner: On the other side are the respondents--the FCC, Justice Department, and intervenors on its side, which includes major ISPs.Non-governmental petitioners, Mozilla et al., will begin the argument, represented by Pantelis Michalopoulos of Michalopoulos, Steptoe & Johnson, who is a familiar face and voice on the pro-net neutrality rule side of the legal argument.The first 25 minutes will be devoted to the argument that the FCC's reclassification of internet access as a Title I information service violates statutory language and was not a reasonable reading of the statute, the FCC's ""disavowal"" of other sources of regulatory authority, and its treatment of competition-related concerns related to the availability of internet access. He will get 25 minutes, though likely extended by judge questions during that argument.That will be followed by 20 minutes of argument, again for the petitioners, by Kevin Russell, Goldstein & Russell. He will argue that it was illegal for the FCC to reclassify mobile broadband access as Title I. Non-government intervenors then get five minutes, represented by Stephanie Weiner, Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP.“Mozilla filed this lawsuit because fighting for a free, open and competitive internet is part of our DNA,” said Denelle Dixon, COO of Mozilla, in a press call with reporters about the arguments. “Net neutrality is still an essential consumer protection that everyone online deserves, and this case is the fight to save it. We are confident that the FCC’s repeal lacks legal and factual support, and we look forward to having our case heard in court.” Next come the government petitioners-all those states listed above will get their shot at the FCC order.Danielle Goldstein, of the County of Santa Clara, Calif., will get 10 minutes to argue about the order's impact on public safety and government services.Stephen Wu of the State of New York, will get 15 minutes to argue against the FCC order's preemption of state efforts to regulate net neutrality.“The FCC's revocation of the net neutrality rules was unlawful – the FCC entirely ignored the requirement that it take the public safety risks of its actions into account,” said Santa Clara County Counsel James Williams Wednesday (Jan. 30). “Instead, the Commission's action allows the ISPs to pursue their economic interests even when at the expense of public safety. That’s an unacceptable prospect for key public safety service providers like the County of Santa Clara.”The respondents--the FCC and the Justice Department--will get 60 minutes to make their case on all those issues, represented by FCC General Counsel Tom Johnson, followed by 15 minutes for the ISP intervenors in support of the FCC, represented by Jonathan Nuechterlein of Sidley Austin.At a Free State Foundation event last fall, Johnson said he was confident in the FCC's argument. ""While I would never want to predict the outcome of an appeal,"" he said, ""it is always nice to have both the United States Supreme Court and the court of appeals on record saying that the federal agency you represent has discretion to make the very decision you are now defending....[I]f oral argument in this case were to adopt the rules of the classic TV game show 'Name That Tune,' I would say I could argue this case in two words: Brand X.""That is a reference to the 2005 Supreme Court decision (National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services) upholding an earlier FCC's authority well over a decade ago to classify internet access services as information services not subject to mandatory access to their networks by competitors, concluding it should be accorded so called Chevron deference to that decision, which means the tendency to defer to an agency's expertise in interpreting an ambiguous statute.“We are confident that the Restoring Internet Freedom Order will be upheld in court,"" said Matthew Berry, chief of staff to FCC chair Ajit Pai. ""The U.S. Supreme Court has already affirmed the FCC’s authority to classify broadband as a Title I information service, and we have every reason to believe that the judiciary will uphold the FCC’s decision to return to that regulatory framework under which the Internet flourished prior to 2015 and is continuing to thrive today.”In December 2017, a bitterly divided, Republican-controlled, FCC voted to approve the Restoring Internet Freedom order and eliminate most network-neutrality rules; reclassify ISPs, wired and wireless, as non-common carriers (no longer subject to Title II-based regulations); and deed most of the internet policing functions to the Federal Trade Commission or Justice Department.Gone were the rules against blocking, throttling and paid prioritization adopted under the previous Democratic majority, as well as the internet conduct standard by which the FCC could review conduct not prohibited by those rules -- like zero-rating plans -- but that might adversely affect internet openness and access to content.The item restored the FTC's authority over broadband regulation, and adopted a transparency rule that requires ISPs to let the government and web users know how they are managing their networks and what business practices they are using, which the FTC can enforce if those practices are unfair or deceptive or anticompetitive, and the Justice Department can enforce if they violate antitrust laws.It is up to the court to decide if that latest regulatory take on net neutrality passes muster or whether the FCC must return to the drawing board once again.Said government shutdown won't delay issue's latest day in courtArgument will be streamed liveCourt also signals extended government shutdown could create 'serious disruptions'Cites partial government shutdown, Justice adviceRosenworcel 'hopeful' FCC will be reversed, dereg fans confident FCC will prevailSays it also restored internet investmentJudges probe both sides in legal marathonSaid 'net is at risk while rule rollback remains",2,10,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Should Net Neutrality Be Restored?

So, I just thought that since the state was looking at making all police officers wear body cameras, I figured this might be a good way to have records of what lawmakers are doing.”House Bill 3447 would direct the State Board of Elections to develop rules for the use of body cameras by public officials of the state.Recordings made with the use of a body camera worn by a public official could be used as evidence in any administrative, judicial, legislative or disciplinary proceeding.

It’s more of if someone makes an allegation or a complaint, you’ll at least have some footage to go through.”The proposal is a unique but costly approach to weeding out corruption, said state Rep. Joe Sosnowski, R-Rockford.“If it’s limited to certain groups of officials, that could limit the cost, but it could be extremely expensive,” Sosnowski said. “Then, of course, you have all of the backroom support and infrastructure as far as recording and maintaining the records and the servers and those folks to maintain that. It would probably be a very costly endeavor and I think it would be very difficult to enforce when they actually were using it.”State Sen.

I can’t see (House Speaker Mike) Madigan letting this see the light of day.”Still, the idea has merit, Cabello said.“It’s time we start getting public trust back for the elected officials and the only way that’s going to happen is we have to root out the corruption,” he said.Ken DeCoster: 815-987-1391; kdecoster@rrstar.com; @DeCosterKenadvertisementROCKFORD — Fehr Graham recently announced the hires of Jeff Macke as senior project engineer and Ryan Peterson as hydrogeologist.Macke has… Read MoreWelcome to your feed!

36,Electoral College,Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections?,1s36q5r,https://townhall.com/columnists/jeffjacoby/2019/02/18/the-republican-president-who-alienated-republicans-n2541628,The Republican President Who Alienated Republicans,"APART FROM history buffs and aficionados of presidential beards, few Americans today have ever heard of Benjamin Harrison. Yet on this Presidents Day weekend, there is a lesson to be learned from the experience of our obscure 23rd president.When he entered the White House in 1889, it was with a pedigree unmatched in American presidential history.He was the son of John Scott Harrison, an Ohio farmer and two-term member of Congress. He was the grandson of William Henry Harrison, a war hero who was elected the ninth president of the United States. He was the great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison V, a Founding Father who served in the Continental Congress, signed the Declaration of Independence, and was both a Virginia governor and speaker of the elected House of Delegates. And he was the great-great-great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison III, a gifted 17th-century Virginia politician, who became the colony's attorney general when he was just 24, then went on to become speaker of the House of Burgesses and Virginia's treasurer before his untimely death at 36.But while politics was in the family line, Harrison was anything but a normal politician.On paper, he fit the part. As a fledgling lawyer in Indianapolis, where he and his wife moved after getting married, he made a name for himself as a gifted speaker and rose steadily in Republican Party circles. He won election to the post of Indiana Supreme Court reporter, narrowly lost a race for governor, and in 1880 was named to the US Senate. Yet his demeanor with political people was nearly always chilly and standoffish. He was described as a ""refrigerator"" by the GOP's national chairman, and as ""the human iceberg"" by the most powerful Republican in Congress, House Speaker Thomas Reed. The very opposite of a glad-handing back-slapper, Harrison didn't like to shake hands (and always wore gloves when doing so). But he had a knack for addressing crowds that kept him in great demand as a Republican Party campaigner.""Harrison can make a speech to ten thousand men and every man will go away his friend,"" it was said of him. ""Let him meet the same ten thousand men in private and everyone will go away his enemy.""For Republican strategists seeking a candidate to challenge Democratic President Grover Cleveland in the 1888 election, however, Harrison had assets that outweighed his stiffness and lack of bonhomie. Above all, he was the acknowledged leader of the Republicans in Indiana and had guided the state party to notable success in the 1886 midterms. Indiana was then one of the two most crucial ""doubtful"" states — or as we would say today, swing states — in presidential politics. The other was President Cleveland's home state of New York, where Democrats appeared to be running strong.At the Republican convention in 1888, seven candidates contended for the nomination. Harrison wasn't the favorite, but he was everyone's second choice and gradually gained strength through seven roll calls as the front-runners faded. On the eighth ballot, Harrison captured the nomination. In the campaign that followed he played to his strengths, giving speech after speech to delegations that traveled Indianapolis to see him. On Election Day, Cleveland won the national popular vote by 90,000 — but Harrison narrowly carried Indiana and New York, thereby clinching a majority in the Electoral College to become the 23rd president of the United States.From the perspective of a 21st-century American, the election of 1888 and the Harrison administration that followed are a reminder of an inconvenient truth about political parties: They exist to fight and win elections, not to uphold permanent principles.To Republican or Democratic true believers, it may seem sacrilegious to deny that their parties stand for lasting values, or that those values are why voters choose to become Republicans or Democrats. But in the long run, there are no timeless Republican or Democratic articles of faith.In recent years, traditional GOP conservatives have been discombobulated by the changes that Donald Trump has wrought in the Party of Reagan; centrist Democrats in Bill Clinton's mold have felt similarly displaced from the mainstream of their party.That is nothing, though, to the way the parties have shifted since Harrison's time.The GOP of 1888 was the party of unabashed protectionism, higher tariffs, increased spending, and expanded entitlements (in the form of lavish pensions for Civil War veterans). Cleveland and the Democrats, by contrast, embraced the cause of government restraint; they urged a reduction in tariffs to ease consumer prices, and argued that the government surplus should not be spent by Washington but returned to the private economy.The Republicans of the 1880s were also the party of black civil rights.Repeatedly and eloquently, Harrison appealed for strong federal action to combat the disenfranchisement of African Americans in the South. ""When and under what conditions,"" he demanded, ""is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law?"" Democrats, on the other hand, implacably opposed Harrison's voting-rights measure. They reviled it as a ""force bill"" that would bring federal bayonets to Southern polling places and allow whites to be ""over-ridden and down-trodden"" by the blacks they considered inferior. The legislation died in a Senate filibuster, but Harrison's sincerity was never in doubt. His efforts on behalf of voting rights said Frederick Douglass, ""should endear him to the colored people as long as he lives.""Unfortunately for Harrison, he had never managed to endear himself to leaders of his own party. Almost from the moment, he was elected, the ""human iceberg"" began alienating top Republicans, bypassing them for Cabinet posts and ignoring their recommendations on patronage.""Resentments were famous,"" political scientist Karen Orren wrote in a 2004 essay. ""Speaker Reed lamented he had only two enemies in Maine, and Harrison appointed one of the collectors of customs. Harrison refused [Ohio Senator Marcus] Hanna, who raised unprecedented funds for the 1888 campaign, the patronage of the Cleveland lighthouse."" New York's powerful Republican boss, Thomas Platt, ""went to his grave claiming Harrison broke a promise to make him secretary of the treasury.""Harrison managed to lose support even when he granted supplications.""I suppose he treated me about as well ... as he did any other Senator,"" Senator Shelby Cullom of Illinois later recounted, ""but whenever he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please.""As the 1892 election approached, more than a few Republicans were fed up with Harrison. Some maneuvered to replace him as party standard-bearer with Secretary of State James Blaine, who had been the GOP nominee in 1884. The insurgency failed — then as now, it was virtually impossible for a sitting president to be denied renomination.But then as now, even an unsuccessful intraparty challenge could fatally weaken a president seeking a second term. Foreshadowing the fate of later presidents such as Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush — all of whom ran for reelection with only lukewarm support from party loyalists — Harrison had no chance of prevailing. The Democratic candidate was again Grover Cleveland, who drew almost as many votes as he had four years earlier. But Harrison did far worse, as hundreds of thousands of Republicans in the West defected to a new third party, the Populists. New York and Indiana switched back to the Democrats. Cleveland won in a rout, and both houses of Congress went Democratic for the first time in decades.On this Presidents Day, Harrison's experience might be read as a cautionary tale about the limitations of a prominent family brand or an aptitude for stump speaking. In the end, those weren't enough to overcome the dismay and divisions the 23rd president engendered in his own party. Democrats, united in their opposition, reclaimed the White House and sent the president with the troublesome personality back home to Indianapolis.Recommended from TownhallFed Up: Democrats to Vote on Resolution Condemning Ilhan Omar's Continued Anti-Semitism6 Reasons Why 401(k) Plans Are a Rip-OffThis Bernie Sanders Attempt To Make Inroads With Black Democrats Was Brutal To WatchUh Oh: Rashida Tlaib Violated Blatantly Spelled Out FEC Finance RulesWhy Trump Must Veto the Federal Land Grab BillTop Dems Claim There's Evidence of CollusionHoly Moly: Trump Triggered The MSM (Again).

Therefore, corporate offices are best described as a melting pot of people from different walks of life, where people from across the country, of different age groups, genders, sexual orientation and cultures work.The government, organisations and the society at large are keenly aware of these differences, and see this both as a benefit and as a challenge. This awareness has led to a host of policy changes, including extension of maternity leave, Article 377 and so on.However, mere policy does not change mindsets. It is therefore, important to understand the grip of social conditioning and how it leads to stereotyping and biases.Understanding stereotypesWebster defines stereotype as ‘a standardized mental picture that is held in common by members of a group and that represents an oversimplified opinion, prejudiced attitude, or uncritical judgment’. While stereotypes can never really represent the truth of any individual, unfortunately they do impact how we perceive those from a different culture and community. Anyone with wisdom will caution that attributing qualities to someone based on stereotypes of the community they’re from usually leads to gross lapses in judgement. Many of the smartest Indians in business are not from a community renowned for their business acumen, while many of the bravest soldier’s aren’t members of what are traditionally considered martial communities. While stereotypes may ease interaction on a superficial level, they can never be a foundation on which meaningful relationships based on merit, trust and empathy are built. So while most Indians wouldn’t be surprised that Vijender Singh won India a bronze medal for boxing in the Olympics and that Viswanathan Anand is uniquely gifted in chess, it important to know that using generic stereotypes to define communities does not create an accurate portrait of people.Coming to gender stereotypes, The traditional gender roles, that claim men as the primary bread winner, and women as the primary care giver, often come in the way of women continuing with their careers and reaching leadership positions. The gender gap, in employment and pay continues to be stark. The traditional understanding of certain roles being only suitable for men, for example sales and manufacturing, leads to women being underrepresented in these functions. “Women” fighting “Dangal” gets a movie, Mary Kom being a “mother of two” tops being a boxer, “Women in science” gets a special day. A man being a nurse, or two men holding hands in a park still gets raised eyebrows and smirks.While stereotyping might make great points for stand-up comedians and WhatsApp jokes, relying on “insights” from stereotypes to make judgments on employment, careers, promotions, increments can lead to gross consequences…. For the manager making the decision, for the employee, for the organisation and the society at large.Changes to Archaic LawsWhile removing Article 377 was a good decision, as was the decision to extend maternity leave, has it truly made a difference to the people it was supposed to help?The LGBT community despite the change in law may still feel persecuted by society. Just because a law has been removed, doesn’t mean that prejudice in people’s hearts has been removed at the stroke of a pen. Many employed pregnant women may still suffer from insecurity of employment, unpaid work despite a law favourable to them.While organisations have claimed that they are welcoming to all for hiring, there will be no tangible change unless we address mindsets. Have we truly stopped that wink-wink-nod-nod sniggering or shaming across the board? Do we even understand the issues this set of individuals face? Are our medical and insurance policies covering same sex couples? Are we providing for soft landing for returning mothers?There’s a lot to ponder!A need for dialogue of inclusivenessSo how do you create an inclusive workplace, where every one feels included not just in letter, but in spirit — where every one feels enabled, and gets equal opportunity to shine and grow. It’s therefore, the responsibility of every institution in India to genuinely drive inclusion, create policies, processes and an overall environment uniquely suited to the diverse workforce in India.It needs to start from the top, the moment leadership speaks about it, the entire system responds. Second, the policies need to acknowledge and proactively build in solutions to bias. For example, adoption for same sex couples needs a treatment similar to maternity, it cannot be met with ‘speak to HR / your boss/ anyone but me’. The implications of this ranges from leave policy to performance policy to medical… it needs a comprehensive view on what’s written and what’s not been written. Once done, have KRAs, measures, reviews to force the needle. Lastly, celebrate, acknowledge and speak about differences.

Daniel Connolly, The Commercial AppealDemocrats and an immigrant and refugee rights organization are pushing new proposals that they say will protect local governments over a state law that prohibits sanctuary cities in Tennessee. The political arm of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition recently announced its support for two bills aimed at the law enacted last year. That measure, which prohibits sanctuary cities and requires local law enforcement officials to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to hold immigrants for deportation, became law last year without former Gov. Bill Haslam's signature. When Haslam announced his decision not to veto the law in May, Republican lawmakers praised his action while TIRRC said it could trigger boycotts and legal action and lead to unintended consequences.  In a recent statement, Lisa Sherman-Nikolaus, policy director at TIRRC Votes, the group's political arm, said lawmakers' decision to approve the anti-sanctuary cities measure was ""cheap politics over sound policy.""Since the enactment of the anti-sanctuary cities law, Shelby County Attorney Marlinee Iverson said it could violate the U.S. Constitution. Shelby County officials said they would not follow the measure, leading House Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, to call for a ""serious discussion"" on the matter. The new proposals from TIRRC Votes and the Democrats include one that would require the state to reimburse any localities that incurred expenses while complying with the law. Several local governments around the country have been forced to pay damages while complying with ICE detainer requests, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.The bill, SB 507 and HB 558, from Sen. Raumesh Akbari and Rep. Karen Camper, both Memphis Democrats, would also require the attorney general to record how much money the state and local governments have spent to comply with federal immigration laws. ""We must allow local leaders to invest in areas with desperate need like education and health care — not force them to divert critical resources to help the federal government deport undocumented members of our community,"" Camper said in a statement. Another measure, SB 931 and HB 1110, from Sen. Jeff Yarbro and Rep. Jason Powell, both Nashville Democrats, would allow local police departments to take statements from victims and witnesses of crimes without asking about the interviewee's immigration status. Under current law, police departments cannot create policies that prohibit asking about the immigration status of a victim or a witness. Critics of the law say that creates a chilling effect among immigrants in terms of reporting crimes and cooperating with law enforcement. ""Communities are built on trust,"" Yarbro said in a statement. ""The job of law enforcement is to promote public safety and investigate crimes, but they cannot do that effectively when large portions of our communities are afraid to call the police or serve as witnesses.""

Whether or not this topic presents itself into reality, is besides the matter; however, the fact being that it can happen is plausible.Imagine powering a house, city, state, and nation entirely with energy from renewable sources: wind, sun, water (hydroelectricity), naturally occurring heat (geothermal), and plants. How does that sound?We wouldn’t have to worry about coal mines and the disasters that follow it, oil wells, pipelines, or coal trains. No greenhouse gas emissions, car exhaust, or polluted streams. No wars over oil, dependence on foreign suppliers, or resource shortages.During the debate we had the opportunity to hear many viewpoints from both the affirmative and the negative. One of the negatives arguments is that for reusable energy to be effective, we would need the sun; however, the sun is not always present. The affirmative stated that we would not always need the sun because…The negative also brought in he political argument of the government being ran by the Republican party. “Being that the government is mostly conservative, the ideas of reusable energy would simply not be plausible — Coal mines, oil, etc. will be a necessity,” said the negative.When looking back at the topic itself, the affirmative reiterated that she was not debating whether or not this will happen in the future, but more so how it can essentially happen.

The final verdict: cellphone radiation may sometimes cause tumors in rats at high, continuous doses, but not in people.The report leaves open the possibility that the kind of radiation produced by cellphones might have the potential to cause cancer, but it does not answer the question of how that might happen. The findings are unlikely to satisfy many people.""The National Toxicology Program concluded there is clear evidence that male rats exposed to high levels of radio frequency radiation like that used in 2G and 3G cell phones developed cancerous heart tumors,"" the National Institutes of Health, parent agency of the NTP, said in a statement.The final report doesn’t change much that the researchers said in a preliminary report released in February. It found there is evidence that bathing rats in certain types of cellphone radiation for their entire lives might raise the risk of certain cancers in some of the rats.The findings do not apply to people, they said.“The exposures used in our studies are not directly comparable to the exposures that humans typically experience when using a cellphone,” the National Toxicology Program’s John Bucher told reporters.The NTP team did not expose the rats to the 4G frequencies now in common use.The NTP gave its February report to experts for review, and Thursday’s report reflects their comments. In general, Bucher said, they advised the NTP to strengthen its confidence in what was found.The two most significant findings: Male rats bombarded with high doses of cellphone radiation had a higher risk of a type of rare cancer called a schwannoma in the nerves surrounding the heart. In February, the NTP said there was some evidence this happened but now says the evidence is clear.And they said there was now equivocal, or unclear, evidence that some female rats may develop similar tumors.""In the brain of males, there were increased incidences of malignant glioma,"" the report added.In a seeming contradiction, male rats exposed to cellphone signals lived longer than rats not exposed. They were especially less prone to a type of inflammatory kidney disease.It’s still not clear why either thing might happen. The type of radiation that comes from cellphones is very different from the radiation that comes from gamma rays or nuclear energy. It can make tissue warm, but the rats were not given high enough doses to warm their tissues.“We saw evidence of DNA damage in some tissue of some animals,” Bucher said. This will help guide scientists in targeting their future research.Rat studies often find cancer links that never show up in people. And mice were not as strongly affected as rats seemed to be.“We do believe that the tumor responses that we have seen in our studies is real and they are associated with radiofrequency radiation,” Bucher said.But the bottom line of the report is that people should not worry that they will get cancer from using their cellphones.“Exposure to radiofrequency radiation has long been thought to be of no health concern as long as the energy level was low and didn’t cause heating of the tissues,” Bucher said.“Based on our results, we are planning further studies to confirm that the experimental evidence continues to support this.”The $30 million, decades-long study has involved 3,000 rats and mice, some of which were irradiated while pregnant and the pups then also exposed to the cellphone radiation.“In our studies, rats and mice received radio frequency radiation across their whole bodies,” Bucher said.“By contrast, people are mostly exposed in specific local tissues close to where they hold the phone. In addition, the exposure levels and durations in our studies were greater than what people experience.”The Food and Drug Administration said it concurs that the research doesn’t indicate people have any risk of cancer from using cellphones.“We agree that these findings should not be applied to human cell phone usage,” the FDA’s Dr. Jeffrey Shuren said in a statement.He said the data from the study was confusing and contradictory. As scientists often say, more study is needed.“As scientists, we welcome new studies,” Shuren said.“Animal studies like this one contribute to our discussions on this topic, but we must remember the study was not designed to test the safety of cell phone use in humans, so we cannot draw conclusions about the risks of cell phone use from it.”The American Cancer Society, which tracks the incidence of cancer, has noted that there has not been a noticeable increase in cancer types that might be associated with cellphone use.“Based on our ongoing evaluation of this issue, the totality of the available scientific evidence continues to not support adverse health effects in humans caused by exposures at or under the current radiofrequency energy exposure limits,” Shuren said.“We believe the existing safety limits for cell phones remain acceptable for protecting the public health.”People can be exposed to radiofrequency radiation from cellphone towers, the report notes, but it’s much more diffuse than what people get from using a cellphone.As for Bucher, he says he’s not a heavy cellphone user himself.“I have become, based on these studies, a little more aware of my use of cellphones and if I make a short call I have absolutely no hesitation at all in picking up the phone and using it in a traditional manner,” he said.“If I’m on a conference call for an hour or two I tend to think about using earbuds or some other way of increasing the distance between the cellphone and my body.”© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL",2,6,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Is Cell Phone Radiation Safe?

The Long History Of Student Loan Bankruptcy 3.17.15 9:00 AM EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akielerThe Long History Of Student Loan Bankruptcy private student loans student loans federal student loans bankruptcy student Loans and Bankruptcy Bankruptcy codeAlthough bankruptcy should only be viewed as the last option for consumers drowning in a sea of debt, even this final-straw course of action won’t help Americans with getting out from under hefty student loans — but it wasn’t always this way. Students being crushed under the weight of mounting student loan debt have few options when it comes to receiving forgiveness for their debts, and bankruptcy is often the least obtainable.Other debts, including your mortgage and auto loans, are dischargeable through bankruptcy filings, but student loans can only be discharged if the borrower proves “undue hardship” through a court determination.And that process is surprisingly arbitrary, according to the National Consumer Law Center.It is entirely up to the court to decide whether a borrower meets the standard, and the standard can vary a great deal, because the bankruptcy code does not provide an actual definition of undue hardship.But for the sake of an example, the NCLC provides this scenario in which a court might decide that student loan discharge is necessary:However, even under this circumstance, discharge isn’t a foregone conclusion.While the process to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy is long and tedious it wasn’t always that way.Prior to 1976, student loans weren’t protected from bankruptcy proceedings. But that year, amid concern over high default rates, Congress passed legislation intended to safeguard federal investments.The first version of the law put a ban on bankruptcy discharges for the first five years after a federal student loan was originated. It did include an undue hardship allowance that could discharge the debt earlier.Two years later, lawmakers proposed a bill that would have returned bankruptcy rights to student loan borrowers.

The Long History Of Student Loan Bankruptcy 3.17.15 9:00 AM EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akielerThe Long History Of Student Loan Bankruptcy private student loans student loans federal student loans bankruptcy student Loans and Bankruptcy Bankruptcy codeAlthough bankruptcy should only be viewed as the last option for consumers drowning in a sea of debt, even this final-straw course of action won’t help Americans with getting out from under hefty student loans — but it wasn’t always this way. Students being crushed under the weight of mounting student loan debt have few options when it comes to receiving forgiveness for their debts, and bankruptcy is often the least obtainable.Other debts, including your mortgage and auto loans, are dischargeable through bankruptcy filings, but student loans can only be discharged if the borrower proves “undue hardship” through a court determination.And that process is surprisingly arbitrary, according to the National Consumer Law Center.It is entirely up to the court to decide whether a borrower meets the standard, and the standard can vary a great deal, because the bankruptcy code does not provide an actual definition of undue hardship.But for the sake of an example, the NCLC provides this scenario in which a court might decide that student loan discharge is necessary:However, even under this circumstance, discharge isn’t a foregone conclusion.While the process to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy is long and tedious it wasn’t always that way.Prior to 1976, student loans weren’t protected from bankruptcy proceedings. But that year, amid concern over high default rates, Congress passed legislation intended to safeguard federal investments.The first version of the law put a ban on bankruptcy discharges for the first five years after a federal student loan was originated. It did include an undue hardship allowance that could discharge the debt earlier.Two years later, lawmakers proposed a bill that would have returned bankruptcy rights to student loan borrowers. However, that legislation failed, and discharging federal loans through bankruptcy continued to be prohibited during the first five years after loan origination.The law changed again in 1990, when the five-year rule was extended to seven years. In 1998, the law was revised again to remove any timeframe for allowable discharges, leaving undue hardship as the only way out.At the time, this only applied to federal student loans.

Period. Exclamation point!We have to fix lax controls at our borders. And foreigners who overstay temporary visas have to be rounded up and unceremoniously sent back to where they came from.We have the obligation to protect ourselves from physical attacks and from people who merely want to take advantage of our country’s kindness.Border wall? I don’t think it will keep out the determined illegal immigrants who are likely to make the most trouble. We need something — but something better. Something high-techy. A great big wall was state-of-the-art in 220 BC.And we should give visas and green cards only to people whom we’d want as neighbors; who are likely to contribute to our society and America’s well-being no matter what country they are from. And if these legal immigrants want to stay and become citizens, that’s even better.And those already here illegally who haven’t behaved should get kicked out.Now the biggest and most contentious issue: What about illegal immigrants who have behaved? Let’s say someone who is here illegally has worked regularly, paid taxes, hasn’t gotten arrested, has raised a family and contributed to their community.They are the folks who just got off work and are standing next to you watching the kids play baseball and soccer.These people are still here illegally. And because of that, we can’t, and shouldn’t, completely ignore the fact that they entered this country without permission.They broke the law — and a country can’t selectively enforce laws.In this case, I propose that these illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in the US — but only if they obtain a sponsor who will not only vouch for their character but also come to their assistance if they get into trouble financially. If they lose a job, for instance, this sponsor will help pay their bills so the illegal immigrant won’t have to receive assistance from the state or federal government.And this sponsor doesn’t have to be a neighbor. It can also be an organization or someone who has immigration close to their heart.So if the Catholic Church or George Soros or the Clinton Foundation feels so strongly about allowing illegals to stay here, then these people or organizations can take on the financial responsibility for a period of time and relieve taxpayers of the obligation.I think special treatment needs to be given to the Dreamers, the approximately 1.8 million kids who were brought into the US illegally by their parents. Even President Trump looks like he is working on a path to citizenship for the Dreamers, but his idea comes with a catch — funding part of his beautiful Mexico wall.The family sponsorship program I envision above would already cover a lot of the Dreamers. So there will probably be far fewer than 1.8 million who’d have to be taken care of separately.OK, let’s say you are one of those people who don’t give a damn about immigration despite America’s long and cherished history of accepting people from other countries. Let’s say you are one of those get-them-all-the-hell-out-of-here types.Well, Social Security is going to have a tough time making payments to workers who retire years from now unless the working population in America grows dramatically.One thing you already know about Social Security: It is not a gift from the government. I’ve paid hundreds of thousands of dollars into Social Security. And you probably have also.But the government controls this money like it was an entitlement. Washington can, and probably will, change when you can start collecting, the rules under which you can retire and the amounts you get when you do.It’s your money, but Washington rules over it.Social Security is also a pyramid scheme — a Ponzi scheme is a less polite term. The system only works when there is more money coming in than is being paid out.So far this pyramid has worked because Americans were producing a lot of babies — or, to put it another way, a lot of future workers.Americans might suddenly go crazy and again start having lots of kids. But that’s not likely given the cost of raising children nowadays. And even if there was another baby boom, that wouldn’t help for another 18 years or so, when those newborns start entering the workforce.So the only answer to keep the Social Security pyramid functioning is to allow people from other countries to come here to work, pay taxes and contribute to Social Security.I find this distasteful to say, but it has always been true: Immigrants also tend to fill jobs that Americans don’t want. True, many immigrants have also gone on to great things — founding some phenomenal tech giants that employ thousands.Part of America’s current dislike for immigration has to do with the fact that this country has been producing too few jobs over the past 10 years. Hopefully we’ll fix that problem some day.Once there are too many jobs in America, a lot of people will probably change their attitude toward people from other countries.

47,Golf - Is It a Sport,Is Golf a Sport?,1s47q4r,http://www.thedartmouth.com/article/2019/02/the-accidental-fan-what-is-a-sport,The Accidental Fan: What is a sport? |  The Dartmouth,"Neither dance nor football is easy. Both take extreme skill and stamina. But while football is inarguably a sport, I wonder if dance can be classified as such. The 2007 movie “The Game Plan” intimates that dance is even more difficult than football. The lead female character, a ballet teacher, is getting ready to teach Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson’s character, an NFL football player, how to dance. She proceeds to take him through a crazy workout that has him gasping for air and in desperate need of water. As he tries to shrug off his exhaustion, she says, “If ballet were easy, they’d call it football.”I danced from the time I was about 3 until I finished high school. Whenever someone asks me if I did a sport in high school, I say, “No, but I did dance.” This is mostly because it fulfills the “physical activity” requirement implicit in that question. No, I didn’t play a sport, but yes, I engaged in an activity that required physical strength and discipline. In fact, dance counted as a P.E. credit at my high school. This speaks to the athleticism required of dancers. My dance company did conditioning frequently, and many of the dances we performed were exhausting to run through. Not only do dancers require endurance, but they must also train their muscles to lift their legs high in kicks, to leap off of the ground and to stay perfectly aligned. Dance requires athletic feats as well as the physical strength and ability to make them look effortless. But why does that matter? Isn’t that just part of the performance? That is what dance really is. However, perhaps we need to consider the technique and endurance required of dancers as similar to that of athletes. After all, some sports require far less endurance than dance or football. Take golf, for example. As someone who has played golf, I can personally speak to the skill part. Golf takes an incredible level of precision and control, which is not something to take lightly. As far as physical exertion goes, however, I think players would have to walk the course (which some people do) in order to burn any calories. Nevertheless, I’ve definitely been sore after golf, mostly due to holding my muscles in strange positions, and because somehow the skin on my thumb is always getting rubbed off! So, in regard to pure physical endurance, golf falls behind dance. However, they both require extreme technique and skill, which is consistent with people’s cultural understanding of what a sport is. That raises the question: what does golf have that dance doesn’t? Well, golf is competitive. Dance is not inherently so, and can be a form of art, storytelling and entertainment. But dance can also be competitive. There is a whole industry of dance competitions. Dancers travel around and hold competitions at different high schools, and dance schools from all over that area travel there to compete. Competitors can either perform solo or in a group or team. Some studios are very focused on competition, but others are not at all. Dancers may compete, but the activity does not demand that they do. This makes things fuzzy.Let’s look at another example. I would consider cheerleading to be a sport, though I think the perspectives on this vary. There are cheerleading competitions, so in that regard, it is similar to dance and to golf. Of course, it also requires skill and athletic prowess. But when cheerleaders are supporting their team at a game, is that no longer a sport? They are still performing many of the same stunts that they do in competition. Does the activity change when the competitive aspect is removed as long as it has the other components?It is interesting to consider this in relation to golf. People often play golf alone. Sometimes, this is to make up or play ahead of time for a league, which involves competition amongst league members. However, sometimes people play golf alone just to practice or for fun. In most sports, practicing may not involve playing the actual game, like playing catch with a football or baseball. On the other hand, in tennis, one might practice with two players and maintain the competitive nature, as the sport only involves two or four players. However, in golf, if you play alone, you are playing the full game. You could add other people and still go through the same motions. But who are you competing with? One could argue that in going out alone to play a round of golf, one is competing against oneself. So, in dance and cheerleading, it could be said that even if there is no “competition,” one is still competing against one’s own previous achievements and trying to push oneself further than before. There is a driving force in dance, both in rehearsal and in performance, to have a perfect run-through of the choreography. That is itself a competition. Even if competition is seen as a necessity in regard to classifying an activity as a sport, dance can fulfill this requirement whether or not the dancers are actually performing in a competition.Regardless of whether or not people consider dance to be a sport, dancers are certainly athletes and should be recognized as such. In fact, a dancer is a blend of artist and athlete. As Monique says in “The Game Plan,” “You see, ballerinas can leap as high as you can, but when they go down, they land in plié and they hold and hold.” So perhaps people can think of dance as requiring both the physical endurance of long distance running or soccer with the precision of golf, the grace of figure skating, the flexibility of gymnastics and the expression of theater.Women's basketball drops two over weekend but still alive in Ivy tournament huntMen’s hockey secures No. 5 seed in ECAC tournamentThe Weekend Roundup: Week 9",1,4,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Is Golf a Sport?

19,Corporal Punishment,Should Corporal Punishment Be Used in K-12 Schools?,2s19q9r,https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/05/08/corporal-punishment-and-preschoolers-what-new-federal.html,Corporal Punishment and Preschoolers: What New Federal Data Show - Education Week,"A new trove of federal civil rights data has, for the first time, captured a snapshot of the controversial practice of corporal punishment of preschoolers in the nation's public schools.Nineteen states permit corporal punishment, and the federal Civil Rights Data Collection has for some time collected information on how often K-12 students are spanked, paddled, swatted, or subjected to other forms of physical discipline in schools. Students ages 3 to 5 who attend public preschool programs were for the first time included in the latest data collection, which is based on the 2015-16 school year.The number of young children who were physically disciplined is small—nearly 1,500 children were reported, out of a total preschool population of almost 1.6 million, according to an Education Week Research Center analysis.But ""the fact that it's still legal is a problem,"" said Deborah J. Vagins, currently a member of the leadership staff at the American Association of University Women. Vagins, formerly the senior legislative counsel on civil rights issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, led the organization's efforts to have corporal punishment banned in public schools.""It's important to note that in some states, students receive greater protection from corporal punishment in juvenile-justice facilities than they do in public schools,"" Vagins said.According to Education Department figures, white children made up about 2 in 5 public-school pre-K students during the 2015-16 school year, but represented more than half of the preschoolers who were spanked or paddled.Black and Native American students also were subjected to corporal punishment out of proportion to their representation among the nation's preschoolers. While black children accounted for 19 percent of preschoolers, they were 22 percent of those spanked or paddled. And American Indian students were just 1 percent of the preschool population, but made up 9 percent of those subjected to corporal punishment.By contrast, Latino students made up 29 percent of the preschool population included in this data, but were just 1 in 10 of the students who were identified as being punished physically. Together, children who were Asian-American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or two or more races represented 9 percent of preschoolers, and 5 percent of those punished physically.The corporal punishment information adds to other preschool suspension and expulsion data that the federal government collects from schools.As in prior years, the data showed that suspensions were more often given to black children. They made up 46 percent of preschoolers suspended more than once in 2015-16, while making up 19 percent of the overall preschool population.And preschool punishment overall was heavily tilted towards boys, who make up 54 percent of the preschool population in this report, but more than three-quarters of those who were spanked or paddled, and 81 percent of the preschoolers who were suspended more than once.However, the data also contain puzzling numbers that cast doubt on some conclusions. For example, of the students identified as being subjected to corporal punishment, more than 1,000 were in just two states: Texas and Oklahoma.Of the nearly 600 young children who were reported by schools as being expelled, more than 400 were reported by one school district: La Joya, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Data from that heavily Latino district creates the impression that most preschoolers nationwide who are expelled are Latino.Marina Abdullah, the 29,000-student district's executive director for student services, said that she doesn't know where that number came from. No preschoolers were expelled in the district, and Texas forbids expelling preschoolers and kindergarten students, she said.""Thank you so much for bringing that to our attention,"" Abdullah said. ""If we had expelled even one, the state would have been on us."" Abdullah thinks the number was generated incorrectly from student data files that the district uses to fill out the data report.Debra Andersen, the executive director of Smart Start Oklahoma, noted that prekindergarten programs in the state are overseen by the school district and thus exempt from child-care licensing, which forbids corporal punishment. It's likely that those prekindergarten programs are following the discipline practices that are in use for older children in those school districts.Banning corporal punishment is a hard sell, Andersen said. ""It's very culturally instilled for a lot of people.""The federal government started reporting data on preschool suspensions and expulsions in 2014, prompting a wave of policy actions around the country to ban or restrict the practice. For example, in 2017, Illinois banned expulsion of students from preschool education and early-childhood programs that are funded by the state.""When we expel 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds, we are setting them up for a life where they are much more likely to be ill-prepared for elementary school and among those most at risk for school failure,"" said an editorial backing the legislation that was co-written by Diana Rauner, the president of the Ounce of Prevention Fund. Rauner is married to Bruce Rauner, the Illinois governor.Many of those policy changes, however, would have been going into effect around the same time the data for the recent report was collected, so any impact was hard to gauge. When preschool discipline numbers were first reported, for the 2011-12 school year, black children were estimated at 18 percent of the preschool population, but 48 percent of those suspended more than once. That's about the same as the proportions in this most recent report.Walter S. Gilliam, the director of the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University, has studied preschool discipline extensively. In addition to several states banning expulsion and suspension in preschool, he noted that a recent change in Head Start regulations explicitly bans expulsion, as do new regulations on child-care programs that receive funding through the Community Development Block Grant program.""That's 1.6 million preschoolers who are protected, who were not legally protected two years ago,"" Gilliam said.

Corporal Punishment and Preschoolers: What New Federal Data Show - Education Week A new trove of federal civil rights data has, for the first time, captured a snapshot of the controversial practice of corporal punishment of preschoolers in the nation's public schools.Nineteen states permit corporal punishment, and the federal Civil Rights Data Collection has for some time collected information on how often K-12 students are spanked, paddled, swatted, or subjected to other forms of physical discipline in schools. Students ages 3 to 5 who attend public preschool programs were for the first time included in the latest data collection, which is based on the 2015-16 school year.The number of young children who were physically disciplined is small—nearly 1,500 children were reported, out of a total preschool population of almost 1.6 million, according to an Education Week Research Center analysis.But ""the fact that it's still legal is a problem,"" said Deborah J. Vagins, currently a member of the leadership staff at the American Association of University Women. Vagins, formerly the senior legislative counsel on civil rights issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, led the organization's efforts to have corporal punishment banned in public schools.""It's important to note that in some states, students receive greater protection from corporal punishment in juvenile-justice facilities than they do in public schools,"" Vagins said.According to Education Department figures, white children made up about 2 in 5 public-school pre-K students during the 2015-16 school year, but represented more than half of the preschoolers who were spanked or paddled.Black and Native American students also were subjected to corporal punishment out of proportion to their representation among the nation's preschoolers. While black children accounted for 19 percent of preschoolers, they were 22 percent of those spanked or paddled. And American Indian students were just 1 percent of the preschool population, but made up 9 percent of those subjected to corporal punishment.By contrast, Latino students made up 29 percent of the preschool population included in this data, but were just 1 in 10 of the students who were identified as being punished physically. Together, children who were Asian-American, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or two or more races represented 9 percent of preschoolers, and 5 percent of those punished physically.The corporal punishment information adds to other preschool suspension and expulsion data that the federal government collects from schools.As in prior years, the data showed that suspensions were more often given to black children. They made up 46 percent of preschoolers suspended more than once in 2015-16, while making up 19 percent of the overall preschool population.And preschool punishment overall was heavily tilted towards boys, who make up 54 percent of the preschool population in this report, but more than three-quarters of those who were spanked or paddled, and 81 percent of the preschoolers who were suspended more than once.However, the data also contain puzzling numbers that cast doubt on some conclusions. For example, of the students identified as being subjected to corporal punishment, more than 1,000 were in just two states: Texas and Oklahoma.Of the nearly 600 young children who were reported by schools as being expelled, more than 400 were reported by one school district: La Joya, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Data from that heavily Latino district creates the impression that most preschoolers nationwide who are expelled are Latino.Marina Abdullah, the 29,000-student district's executive director for student services, said that she doesn't know where that number came from. No preschoolers were expelled in the district, and Texas forbids expelling preschoolers and kindergarten students, she said.""Thank you so much for bringing that to our attention,"" Abdullah said. ""If we had expelled even one, the state would have been on us."" Abdullah thinks the number was generated incorrectly from student data files that the district uses to fill out the data report.Debra Andersen, the executive director of Smart Start Oklahoma, noted that prekindergarten programs in the state are overseen by the school district and thus exempt from child-care licensing, which forbids corporal punishment. It's likely that those prekindergarten programs are following the discipline practices that are in use for older children in those school districts.Banning corporal punishment is a hard sell, Andersen said. ""It's very culturally instilled for a lot of people.""The federal government started reporting data on preschool suspensions and expulsions in 2014, prompting a wave of policy actions around the country to ban or restrict the practice. For example, in 2017, Illinois banned expulsion of students from preschool education and early-childhood programs that are funded by the state.""When we expel 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds, we are setting them up for a life where they are much more likely to be ill-prepared for elementary school and among those most at risk for school failure,"" said an editorial backing the legislation that was co-written by Diana Rauner, the president of the Ounce of Prevention Fund. Rauner is married to Bruce Rauner, the Illinois governor.Many of those policy changes, however, would have been going into effect around the same time the data for the recent report was collected, so any impact was hard to gauge. When preschool discipline numbers were first reported, for the 2011-12 school year, black children were estimated at 18 percent of the preschool population, but 48 percent of those suspended more than once. That's about the same as the proportions in this most recent report.Walter S. Gilliam, the director of the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University, has studied preschool discipline extensively. In addition to several states banning expulsion and suspension in preschool, he noted that a recent change in Head Start regulations explicitly bans expulsion, as do new regulations on child-care programs that receive funding through the Community Development Block Grant program.""That's 1.6 million preschoolers who are protected, who were not legally protected two years ago,"" Gilliam said. ""I'd like to think that's having an effect. But there's no way to know.""Kristen Harper, the director of policy development for Child Trends, oversaw the U.S. Department of Education's efforts to promote alternatives to suspension during the Obama administration. The numbers are important to collect, even with some of the challenges in interpreting them, she said.""You take self-reported administrative data that has a lot of policy churn around it, and people have every reason to put themselves in the best light possible,"" Harper said.But one reason it's important to collect information about a wide range of disciplinary practices anyway, Harper said, is to see if schools might be shifting to corporal punishment if other practices, such as suspension or expulsion, are off the table.And the numbers still have to be only part of one piece of evaluating the full picture of how a school or district disciplines its students.""Even if that was the best data in the world you still shouldn't look at it alone,"" she said.Education Week Librarian Maya Riser-Kositsky contributed to this story.",1151,1131

PBDEs are linked to endocrine and thyroid disruption, obesity and cancer, while benzyl is known to contribute to respiratory disorders, skin irritation, multiple myeolma and reproductive disorders.“SVOCs are widely used in electronics, furniture and building materials and can be detected in nearly all indoor environments,” said Heather Stapleton, an environmental chemist at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment. Indoor exposure to the chemicals occur through inhalation, intake of contaminated food and direct contact with the skin. “Human exposure to them is widespread, particularly for young children who spend most of their time indoors and have greater exposure to chemicals found in household dust,” she added.

9,Obamacare,Is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Good for America?,2s9q2r,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/19/we-dont-need-government-run-health-care-get-affordable-universal-coverage/,"We don’t need government-run health care to get to affordable, universal coverage - The Washington Post","Desktop notifications are on   | Turn off Get breaking news alerts from The Washington Post Turn on desktop notifications?David Kendall is senior fellow for health and fiscal policy at the think tank Third Way. Jim Kessler is executive vice president for policy at Third Way.America can insure everyone without changing anyone’s existing health coverage. It won’t require replacing Obamacare with a single-payer, government-run system. Instead, we can build upon Obamacare with two simple, game-changing features: a universal cap on premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, and an automatic coverage system that places the uninsured in a plan they can depend on and afford.These two transformational changes align the interests of those who have coverage and those who don’t against the medical-industrial complex, which for too long has delivered high-cost care instead of high-quality care at reasonable prices. For the 156 million Americans with employer-provided coverage, this proposal answers their top concern: the price they pay. For the 29 million Americans without coverage and millions of others who fear they could lose it, this answers their prayers for stable and secure insurance.Our proposal starts with the Affordable Care Act, which laid the critical foundation for universal and affordable coverage by protecting everyone with a preexisting condition, expanding coverage through Medicaid and private insurance and providing subsidies and limits on costs to those in the individual market with working-class incomes. More than 22 million Americans now have coverage because of Obamacare. And the growth rate of health-care costs is finally falling in the United States.But even with the success of Obamacare, too many people still lack coverage. Among those who do have it, health-care costs remain a major kitchen-table concern.To make coverage affordable for all, we fulfill a simple but daunting promise that has eluded other health-care reform efforts: guaranteed protection from high out-of-pocket costs for everyone. We do this by taking the limited out-of-pocket price protections from Obamacare and making those protections universal. Under our plan, out-of-pocket expenses for premiums, deductibles and co-pays would be capped on a sliding scale based on income. These caps would apply whether insurance came from an employer, the individual market or through Medicare or Medicaid. Where you get your insurance should have no bearing on how much you pay out of your checking account.A family of four with $50,000 in household income would have their total premium and out-of-pocket health care costs capped at $5,000 in a calendar year — 10 percent of annual income. The same family earning $80,000 would have an out-of-pocket cap of 14 percent. And even a family earning $1 million a year would have a cap, albeit a high one, of $200,000 — 20 percent of their income.To ensure everyone is insured, we automatically enroll those who right now would qualify for free care under Obamacare but, for a variety of reasons, remain unenrolled. Doing that alone would cover more than 14 million uninsured people through Medicaid or the individual market. The remaining unenrolled (most of whom qualify for subsidized, but not free, care) would receive an automatic application with the best-value plan in their area to sign on to. And for those who still don’t enroll, we create an automatic backstop — a catastrophic-like plan that kicks in the moment an uninsured person steps into an emergency room. The cost of the backstop would be covered in part by reviving the Obamacare penalty for those who don’t buy insurance. Add to that an affordable early buy-in for Medicare for those over the age of 55, and, combined with our cost cap protections, every person in the United States would be covered with a plan they can afford.This proposal would not be cheap. Our own internal estimate places the total bill for consumer cost caps and universal coverage at $2.8 trillion over 10 years. That is still less than one-tenth the cost of the most prominent single-payer legislation, and much of the cost of our plan will be offset through aggressive measures we propose to tame the medical-industrial complex.For example, we eliminate fee-for-service as the foundation for health-care payments because it rewards costly, wasteful and repetitive services that benefit providers and drug manufacturers over patients. Out-of-network charges will be capped, and surprise billing would be outlawed. New prescription drugs would have to prove they are better for patients compared with the old drugs, not just newer and more expensive. A la carte health care would be replaced with more cost-effective bundled payments that put patient outcomes ahead of billing outcomes. These structural reforms would bend the cost curve, provide real budgetary savings and improve the quality of patient care. The remainder of our plan can be paid for by repealing the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and restoring estate taxes to past levels.Democrats are united that health care must be a right that people can afford, and all of their plans are better than Republican proposals to cut people off from health care. But Democrats need a plan that covers everyone, protects them from high costs and allows the 156 million people who get their health care through their jobs to keep what they have.Read more:Paul Waldman: How bold should Democrats be on health care?

It’s selfish, inconvenient, and it’s not how drop-off lanes are meant to work. I get it. Your child doesn’t have the dexterity to open the door, grab their backpack, and get out of the car all at the same time without help. You stop, park, help your child out, and then walk them up to the front door. All the while, you are holding up dozens of parents that are in just as much of a hurry to get their child to school on time and then drive to work. The drop-off lane is for kids that can get out of the car on their own steam. Look, my daughter had trouble getting out on her own in kindergarten too – and they’re so cute at that age aren’t they? Especially in winter when we have them all dressed up like Randy from The Christmas Story – it’s hard to work door handles when you can’t put your arms down! But, the appropriate course of action is to park in the parking lot and walk your child to the front of the school. You might be a little more inconvenienced – although strangely I’ve found parking takes less time than waiting in the drop-off lane behind parents that don’t know how to use it – but the important thing is that you’ll be doing the right thing. You’ll be showing the world that you know what drop-off lanes are for! There’s a small rush – like when you’re the only one that knows how to function at a four-way stop. But that’s for another day.

In a nutshell, these council members put the desires of some rich complainants above the lives of children. LifeScape supports people with disabilities at all stages of life. The organization includes the building that was formerly known as Children’s Care, near Western and 26th. LifeScape struggles with the space it has; when buses get backed up onto a small stretch of Elmwood, emergency responders are unable to reach the facility. In order to correct this problem, LifeScape asked for an “evacuation”—that is, they requested that the city shut down a small segment of Elmwood to the public so that LifeScape can ensure the safety of the children it supports. These three councilors voted against this; in doing so, they showed they do not care about the lives of children. Especially frustrating is that this kind of “evacuation” has been given to all sorts of organizations in the city, including USF—which Stehly happens to work for. Brekke was especially problematic in her closing remarks, where she gave almost nothing but factually incorrect information. Starr remained silent the entire time. Starr and Stehly’s terms end in 2020; Brekke’s term ends in 2022. I strongly urge you to consider voting for anyone else. And if they can be removed before their terms end, we would be remiss if we did not pursue such a goal. Kyle Rogers, Sioux Falls Civics test bill classic overreach As a teacher and as a parent of three children in South Dakota public schools, I urge South Dakotans and its elected representatives in Pierre to reject HB1066. First, Governor Noem and the Republican super-majority should practice a key conservative principle they espouse: limited government. Local South Dakota school districts should decide for themselves the degree to which their students need or don’t need a citizenship exam. We don’t need the governor and legislators to determine this for us. Second, the vast majority of elected representatives haven’t an ounce of teaching experience. If they did, they would understand what a monumentally bad idea 1066 is. Chiefly, as any teacher knows, proficiency exams of these sorts have little to no educational value in terms of cultivating enduring knowledge and sensibilities. Such would be the case with any civics proficiency exam. “Civics” has rich, complex, and nuanced denotations and connotations. It is laughable to think a 50-question exam (much less a 10-question exam) is somehow going to strengthen students’ knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of civics—whatever one means by “civics.” Third, as any teacher knows, these sorts of proficiency exams are seen by students—and many parents—as a bureaucratic hoop, not a meaningful educational enterprise. Fourth, the bill is an enormous insult to South Dakota’s public school teachers and parents whose children attend public schools. If Governor Noem and those who support this bill want to improve civics education, they should return to college, earn certification, land a teaching position, and engage in the day-in-day-out tough work of educating students. Then they would understand that a proficiency exam is not going supplement or complement, in any meaningful way, the civics education South Dakota students receive in public schools. Governor Noem and representatives who support this bill: don’t insult the teachers and parents of South Dakota by passing HB1066, a classic example governmental overreach and bureaucratic folly. Kevin Cole, Sioux Falls Transphobia behind unneeded athletics bills In Connecticut, petitions to ban trans students from competing on sports teams that align with their gender identity circulated after two trans athletes excelled in state and regional girls’ track meets. In Texas, people were furious that a trans boy won the 2017 girls’ state wrestling championship, blaming the win on hormone therapy. Connecticut has trans-inclusive athletics policy in schools. Texas does not. Preventing trans youth from participating in school sports is less about an even playing field and more about transphobia. Trans students are consistently accused of having an unfair advantage. The common factor seems to be that when trans student athletes excel in their respective sports, transphobic parents, teachers, and even policymakers, have a problem with that. Discriminatory policy and exclusion seem to always be their answer. South Dakota, which currently has inclusive policy for trans student athletes, plans to codify discrimination against trans youth. Two bills that would void the South Dakota High School Activities Association's (SDHSAA) transgender-inclusive policy have been introduced in the state legislature. A study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found lower depression symptoms in adolescents who participated in school sports. With staggering rates of suicide attempts in the trans community, participating in school sports could support the mental wellbeing of trans students. Chris Mosier, the first openly trans member of Team USA, put it this way: “When I didn’t know who I was or how I fit in, sports gave me a purpose and a sense of belonging.” Sen. Jim Bolin stated that his bill was about “fair competition.” Apparently “fair competition” does not include the right of a student athlete to compete without gender discrimination. A variety of factors can give one student an advantage over another in athletic activities, including income level and height. Yet, this bill is solely focused on gender identity. These bills would shift South Dakota from having one of the most inclusive transgender sports policies to one of the least. Exclusion may not prevent trans youth from excelling in sports, as was seen in Texas, but it does make it more difficult for them to enjoy childhood. Trans youth deserve the chance to participate in school sports, compete in competitions, receive scholarships -- and most importantly, to be kids. Maya Ram, Lake Andes Better policies needed for veterans at risk of suicide From 2005 to 2016, U.S. veteran suicide numbers had remained in the 6,000’s. Suicide in the military is an extremely important issue, with the military consisting of 14 percent of suicides in adults. Currently, military policy is in place to direct reporting up the chain of command when a suicide or attempt has occurred. The branches are currently using prevention strategies and programs that work to help prevent suicide in the form of mandatory training. While these programs are trying to have a more positive impact, the rate of suicide isn’t noticeably decreasing. There is more that we can do to improve the military’s mental health in addition to the existing programs. New research can be done to find more effective ways to help those who are under extreme stressors. With a better understanding on how PTSD, anxiety, stress, depression, and distance from family affect a member’s ability to cope, researchers will be able to develop better techniques to decrease the number of suicides that occur each year within the military. Our military members are not average civilians. We need specialized research to help those who are under the increased stress of military life. With new research comes new techniques to aid prevention. We can find new coping mechanisms, psychotherapy, and intervention methods for their specific needs. 20 veterans commit suicide every day. We have to push for more effective policies and research focusing on mental health and suicide prevention for our military. Abigail Kropenske, Ellsworth AFB Laws targeting gender dysphoria are cruel, harmful Recently the South Dakota House of Representatives passed Bill 1108, which is meant to “prohibit certain gender dysphoria instruction in public schools.” This is not the first move by South Dakotan law makers this session to attack transgender youth, and this pattern of hostility must be stopped. For those who don’t know, Gender dysphoria (GD) is the distress a person experiences as a result of having a body that does not match an identity that they hold. A transperson who identifies as a woman while having a male body is one example. GD can manifest in many forms including a sense of anxiety, discomfort, or panic. What some South Dakota law makers would like our state to believe is that teaching this concept is somehow harmful to our youth. As a sex educator and mental health professional I cannot stress enough the power and importance of naming a struggle someone is having. If a young person in South Dakota’s school system is experiencing GD, they may not know this term or that what they are going through is perfectly normal. An educator helping them by naming what GD is could be life affirming. Helping our transyouth is a lifesaving action. In the United States, half of transgender youth attempt suicide in their lifetimes as a direct result of being bullied, looked down upon, cast out, and treated cruelly. This bill, which prohibits schools from caring for transgender youth will only perpetuate this alarming trend. Parents who are concerned about their children learning about gender identity need to realize that in the modern era, these conversations are already happening. Banning language within schools does nothing but sow discontent and cruelty against people who need our support. Our young people deserve an educational space that celebrates diversity and silences hateful actions like this bill. I hope that South Dakota can move forward in a more productive manner, and my heart goes out to those who are targeted by these harmful laws. Libby Trammell, Sioux Falls Vote those that oppose common sense gun laws out of office I hope you are paying attention to what is going on in Pierre. It seems the NRA has taken over. FIrst they voted to allow permit less carry so now there is no guarantee that people carrying a concealed weapon have had a background check (only if they purchased through a licensed dealer) and now they want the state to take over local control of gun regulations which could do away with requiring pawn brokers and gun dealers to report serial numbers of firearms to make sure they aren't stolen. If gun dealers come to Sioux Falls to sell at gun shows I don't think it's too much to ask to make sure they aren't dealing stolen guns. The local police department should be allowed to keep records of stolen firearm serial number - how else will they know who to return it to when they find the guns? If this is a violation of state law then the law needs to be changed to allow the police to keep those records. To do otherwise is a danger to the public. Stand up to the NRA. Contact your legislators and ask that they support common sense gun laws - and if they don't then vote them out the next election! Sheryl Johnson, Sioux Falls Reform, not bemoaning, needed to address mental health Your article of Feb. 7 regarding the incarceration of those suffering from mental illness was compelling but overlooks a larger issue. Incarceration of the mentally ill is, and has been, a problem but it’s only a symptom of a deeper problem. At one time the (renamed) Redfield Developmental Center had 1,199 residents. Today DHS reports it serves about 100 residents. Likewise the (also renamed) Human Services Center in Yankton once housed 1,700 patients while today it serves fewer than it’s capacity of 295. We have made great strides in caring for those with developmental disabilities and mental illness. Contrast this with the changes in our criminal justice system. The U.S. Dept. of Justice reports 391 sentenced prisoners in state and federal institutions for South Dakota in 1970 when I first moved to Sioux Falls. Today that figure is 5,200 according to the Prison Policy Initiative, an increase of more than 1,300 percent. Those with developmental disabilities and mental illness who fall through the cracks are a significant part of this increase. Still, the greater problem is that our criminal justice system is broken and ineffective. It does not effectively serve the citizens of South Dakota, those incarcerated or the correctional officers who struggle to make a broken system work. Our criminal justice system will be reformed, if only because we cannot continue to support the increased cost of an ineffective system. It’s time for state legislators to take the lead in addressing the problem instead of bemoaning the symptoms.",2,7,Not-about,Not-about,Not-about,0,Not-about,"['Not-about', 'Not-about', 'Not-about']","Should Adults Have the Right to Carry a Concealed Handgun? Parents: Stop messing up the drop-off lanes at schools: Your Letters to the Editor for Feb. 17 Parents: Stop messing up the drop-off lanes at schools Stop parking in the drop-off lane at elementary schools. It’s selfish, inconvenient, and it’s not how drop-off lanes are meant to work. I get it. Your child doesn’t have the dexterity to open the door, grab their backpack, and get out of the car all at the same time without help. You stop, park, help your child out, and then walk them up to the front door. All the while, you are holding up dozens of parents that are in just as much of a hurry to get their child to school on time and then drive to work. The drop-off lane is for kids that can get out of the car on their own steam. Look, my daughter had trouble getting out on her own in kindergarten too – and they’re so cute at that age aren’t they? Especially in winter when we have them all dressed up like Randy from The Christmas Story – it’s hard to work door handles when you can’t put your arms down! But, the appropriate course of action is to park in the parking lot and walk your child to the front of the school. You might be a little more inconvenienced – although strangely I’ve found parking takes less time than waiting in the drop-off lane behind parents that don’t know how to use it – but the important thing is that you’ll be doing the right thing. You’ll be showing the world that you know what drop-off lanes are for! There’s a small rush – like when you’re the only one that knows how to function at a four-way stop. But that’s for another day.

11,Prescription Drug Ads,Should Prescription Drugs Be Advertised Directly to Consumers?,1s11q7r,http://www.saukvalley.com/2019/02/11/to-control-drug-prices-states-may-have-to-face-off-against-feds/amv62qc/,"To control drug prices, states may have to face off against feds | SaukValley.com","WASHINGTON – Frustrated by federal inaction, state lawmakers in 41 states have proposed detailed plans to lower soaring prescription drug costs. Some measures would give state Medicaid agencies more negotiating power. Others would disclose the pricing decisions of the drug manufacturers and the companies that administer prescription drug plans.The more ambitious proposals would bump up against federal authority, such as legislation that would allow importing drugs from Canada or alter federal statutes on the prices states pay for drugs in Medicaid. They likely would have to survive a challenge in federal court. And many likely would face resistance from a deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry.According to the National Institute on Money and Politics, a nonprofit that collects campaign finance data, the pharmaceutical industry in 2018 contributed nearly $19 million to state campaigns, and $56 million to federal ones.“States are limited in power in this area,” said Rachel Sachs, a health law expert at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. “But one of the impacts of these efforts is to put pressure on the federal government, and force it to justify its actions to stymie the states.”President Donald Trump has criticized soaring drug prices, and on Thursday the Department of Health and Human Services announced a draft regulation that would allow drugmakers to offer discounted prices directly to consumers — but without giving rebates to Medicaid managed care organizations or the middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers.Between 2012 and 2017, drug spending in the United States increased nearly 29 percent while overall health spending rose less than 25 percent. Since 2013, the growth in prescription drug spending has exceeded GDP growth, which means the industry is consuming an increasingly large share of the U.S. economy.Committees in both houses of Congress held hearings in January to consider how to arrest the trend.In his opening statement, U.S. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, praised what he said is a bipartisan consensus that drug companies’ aggressive price hikes need to be reined in.“We have seen time after time that drug companies make money hand over fist by raising the prices of their drugs — often without justification, and sometimes overnight — while patients are left holding the bill,” Cummings said in his statement, adding later: “We have a duty to act now.”On the other side of Capitol Hill, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the self-described “center-right” American Action Forum, told the Republican-led Senate Finance Committee that government policies were at least partly to blame for rising drug prices.Holtz-Eakin cited laws governing Medicaid payments to drug companies and the Affordable Care Act’s tax increases on manufacturers and importers.“It should not be surprising,” he said, that drug prices increased simultaneously with the passage of the ACA.Priscilla VanderVeer, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying arm of the industry, said PhRMA, as the group is known, would oppose many of the state bills.The proposals wouldn’t lower prices on medications, she said, and would discourage corporate investment in research and development of new drugs.“We absolutely understand where patients are coming from, and their struggles to get the medications they need at an affordable price,” VanderVeer said. “But let’s focus on the entire chain, not just manufacturers.”It isn’t the case, though, that lawmakers are focusing only on manufacturers; a few bills offered this session would force actions either from insurers or pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that administer drug plans. Other proposals would study foreign drug importation or encourage price negotiations to benefit, say, Medicaid patients.The federal government has zealously guarded its authority over drug pricing.Last year, for example, the Trump administration rejected Massachusetts’ request to become the first state to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid program, to extract better prices from pharmaceutical companies.By law, all state Medicaid agencies must carry every drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in return for set rebates from drugmakers.Massachusetts proposed to offer at least one medicine in every “therapeutic class,” that is, treatments intended to address a specific condition or illness, such as blood clots or angina.It also sought the authority to evaluate the effectiveness of newly introduced drugs, by comparing them with other medicines in the same class.That idea worries some health analysts, who note that even within the same therapeutic class, one medication may work better than another for an individual patient. Some organizations that represent people with certain diseases joined drug manufacturers in objecting to Massachusetts’ proposal.The Trump administration also opposes states importing cheaper drugs from Canada.Last year, Vermont became the first state to pursue importation. Vermont’s measure would save the commercial insurance industry between $1 million and $5 million a year, a state report estimated. Lawmakers in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Oregon and Virginia have proposed studies of the idea.But buying drugs from Canada requires federal approval, which, until recently, seemed unlikely. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar last spring said several times he had no interest in allowing Vermont or other states to proceed with such a plan.But in response to some dramatic increases in drug prices, he softened his position, at least in the case of some generic medications produced by a single manufacturer. He said last summer that he was setting up a working group to study importing drugs from abroad.Maryland’s attempt to control drug prices ran aground last year in a federal courtroom. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in April threw out a 2017 Maryland law enacted to curb “unwarranted” price hikes, saying the state had no authority to regulate interstate commerce.Knowing that states are on shaky ground, some drug companies have pushed back against attempts to limit their prices.They did so in New York, where lawmakers in 2017 enacted a requirement that makers of certain high-priced drugs give the state’s Medicaid agency discounts beyond those set by federal statute.Vertex, the manufacturer of a cystic fibrosis medication with a retail price of $272,000 a year, refused. And New York was forced to acknowledge it could not require compliance.In a message to Stateline, Vertex touted the efficacy of its cystic fibrosis drug. “The price of our medicines reflect the significant value they bring to patients,” said Sarah D’Souza, a Vertex spokeswoman, adding, “We do not believe an additional rebate is warranted.”Still, other states see promise in that approach. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, recently proposed a measure that would enable the state Medicaid agency to negotiate further discounts on certain drugs.If negotiations don’t work, the state could subject the manufacturer to a public rate-setting process, require more transparency on pricing, or refer the matter to the state’s attorney general’s office for possible prosecution under consumer protection laws. Legislators in Connecticut and Maryland are pushing similar proposals.State lawmakers in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Virginia also want to prevent drugmakers from enacting steep year-to-year price increases in the commercial market.Under the Minnesota proposal, for example, manufacturers of generic medications would be referred to the state attorney general if they increased the wholesale price of a medication by 50 percent or more. Legislation in the other states also would set limits.Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center, at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Denver, said interfering in the market is a bad idea.“It’s a waste of time, and you’ll only end up with more regulation and higher overall prices,” Gorman said. She argues, for example, that by requiring drugmakers to give discounts to Medicaid agencies, the federal government drives up drug prices in commercial plans.Mindful of recent setbacks, some governors and lawmakers are exploring ideas that wouldn’t require federal approval.In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in January signed an executive order directing all Medicaid managed-care organizations to collectively negotiate drug prices on behalf of the state’s 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Combined, the groups would be the largest direct purchaser of prescription drugs in the country.“We will use our market power and moral power to demand fairer prices for prescription drugs,” Newsom said in his inauguration speech.Other states are emphasizing transparency, with the goal of shaming drug companies into moderating their prices. New Hampshire, New Jersey and Washington state are considering requiring manufacturers to disclose to states (but usually not to the public, to protect proprietary information) what they spend on advertising, and research and development.Still others, including Arizona, Florida, Maine, New Jersey and New York, also want to cast light on the operations of pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, the giant buying networks that administer prescription plans on behalf of insurers.The theory behind PBMs is that their size and expertise results in savings for consumers. In recent years, however, critics have argued that the PBMs are pocketing the savings rather than passing them on to consumers. And in many states, the pharmacy benefit managers impose a gag order on pharmacists, blocking them from telling consumers about cheaper drug options.Other state legislators want to regulate PBMs. Legislators in Delaware, Minnesota and South Carolina have filed bills that would require PBMs to be licensed, so that the state could standardize their practices.

To control drug prices, states may have to face off against feds | SaukValley.com WASHINGTON – Frustrated by federal inaction, state lawmakers in 41 states have proposed detailed plans to lower soaring prescription drug costs. Some measures would give state Medicaid agencies more negotiating power. Others would disclose the pricing decisions of the drug manufacturers and the companies that administer prescription drug plans.The more ambitious proposals would bump up against federal authority, such as legislation that would allow importing drugs from Canada or alter federal statutes on the prices states pay for drugs in Medicaid. They likely would have to survive a challenge in federal court. And many likely would face resistance from a deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry.According to the National Institute on Money and Politics, a nonprofit that collects campaign finance data, the pharmaceutical industry in 2018 contributed nearly $19 million to state campaigns, and $56 million to federal ones.“States are limited in power in this area,” said Rachel Sachs, a health law expert at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law. “But one of the impacts of these efforts is to put pressure on the federal government, and force it to justify its actions to stymie the states.”President Donald Trump has criticized soaring drug prices, and on Thursday the Department of Health and Human Services announced a draft regulation that would allow drugmakers to offer discounted prices directly to consumers — but without giving rebates to Medicaid managed care organizations or the middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers.Between 2012 and 2017, drug spending in the United States increased nearly 29 percent while overall health spending rose less than 25 percent. Since 2013, the growth in prescription drug spending has exceeded GDP growth, which means the industry is consuming an increasingly large share of the U.S. economy.Committees in both houses of Congress held hearings in January to consider how to arrest the trend.In his opening statement, U.S. House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, praised what he said is a bipartisan consensus that drug companies’ aggressive price hikes need to be reined in.“We have seen time after time that drug companies make money hand over fist by raising the prices of their drugs — often without justification, and sometimes overnight — while patients are left holding the bill,” Cummings said in his statement, adding later: “We have a duty to act now.”On the other side of Capitol Hill, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the self-described “center-right” American Action Forum, told the Republican-led Senate Finance Committee that government policies were at least partly to blame for rising drug prices.Holtz-Eakin cited laws governing Medicaid payments to drug companies and the Affordable Care Act’s tax increases on manufacturers and importers.“It should not be surprising,” he said, that drug prices increased simultaneously with the passage of the ACA.Priscilla VanderVeer, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying arm of the industry, said PhRMA, as the group is known, would oppose many of the state bills.The proposals wouldn’t lower prices on medications, she said, and would discourage corporate investment in research and development of new drugs.“We absolutely understand where patients are coming from, and their struggles to get the medications they need at an affordable price,” VanderVeer said. “But let’s focus on the entire chain, not just manufacturers.”It isn’t the case, though, that lawmakers are focusing only on manufacturers; a few bills offered this session would force actions either from insurers or pharmacy benefit managers, the companies that administer drug plans. Other proposals would study foreign drug importation or encourage price negotiations to benefit, say, Medicaid patients.The federal government has zealously guarded its authority over drug pricing.Last year, for example, the Trump administration rejected Massachusetts’ request to become the first state to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid program, to extract better prices from pharmaceutical companies.By law, all state Medicaid agencies must carry every drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in return for set rebates from drugmakers.Massachusetts proposed to offer at least one medicine in every “therapeutic class,” that is, treatments intended to address a specific condition or illness, such as blood clots or angina.It also sought the authority to evaluate the effectiveness of newly introduced drugs, by comparing them with other medicines in the same class.That idea worries some health analysts, who note that even within the same therapeutic class, one medication may work better than another for an individual patient. Some organizations that represent people with certain diseases joined drug manufacturers in objecting to Massachusetts’ proposal.The Trump administration also opposes states importing cheaper drugs from Canada.Last year, Vermont became the first state to pursue importation. Vermont’s measure would save the commercial insurance industry between $1 million and $5 million a year, a state report estimated. Lawmakers in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Oregon and Virginia have proposed studies of the idea.But buying drugs from Canada requires federal approval, which, until recently, seemed unlikely. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar last spring said several times he had no interest in allowing Vermont or other states to proceed with such a plan.But in response to some dramatic increases in drug prices, he softened his position, at least in the case of some generic medications produced by a single manufacturer. He said last summer that he was setting up a working group to study importing drugs from abroad.Maryland’s attempt to control drug prices ran aground last year in a federal courtroom. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in April threw out a 2017 Maryland law enacted to curb “unwarranted” price hikes, saying the state had no authority to regulate interstate commerce.Knowing that states are on shaky ground, some drug companies have pushed back against attempts to limit their prices.They did so in New York, where lawmakers in 2017 enacted a requirement that makers of certain high-priced drugs give the state’s Medicaid agency discounts beyond those set by federal statute.Vertex, the manufacturer of a cystic fibrosis medication with a retail price of $272,000 a year, refused. And New York was forced to acknowledge it could not require compliance.In a message to Stateline, Vertex touted the efficacy of its cystic fibrosis drug. “The price of our medicines reflect the significant value they bring to patients,” said Sarah D’Souza, a Vertex spokeswoman, adding, “We do not believe an additional rebate is warranted.”Still, other states see promise in that approach. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, recently proposed a measure that would enable the state Medicaid agency to negotiate further discounts on certain drugs.If negotiations don’t work, the state could subject the manufacturer to a public rate-setting process, require more transparency on pricing, or refer the matter to the state’s attorney general’s office for possible prosecution under consumer protection laws. Legislators in Connecticut and Maryland are pushing similar proposals.State lawmakers in Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Virginia also want to prevent drugmakers from enacting steep year-to-year price increases in the commercial market.Under the Minnesota proposal, for example, manufacturers of generic medications would be referred to the state attorney general if they increased the wholesale price of a medication by 50 percent or more. Legislation in the other states also would set limits.Linda Gorman, director of the Health Care Policy Center, at the Independence Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Denver, said interfering in the market is a bad idea.“It’s a waste of time, and you’ll only end up with more regulation and higher overall prices,” Gorman said. She argues, for example, that by requiring drugmakers to give discounts to Medicaid agencies, the federal government drives up drug prices in commercial plans.Mindful of recent setbacks, some governors and lawmakers are exploring ideas that wouldn’t require federal approval.In California, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in January signed an executive order directing all Medicaid managed-care organizations to collectively negotiate drug prices on behalf of the state’s 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Combined, the groups would be the largest direct purchaser of prescription drugs in the country.“We will use our market power and moral power to demand fairer prices for prescription drugs,” Newsom said in his inauguration speech.Other states are emphasizing transparency, with the goal of shaming drug companies into moderating their prices. New Hampshire, New Jersey and Washington state are considering requiring manufacturers to disclose to states (but usually not to the public, to protect proprietary information) what they spend on advertising, and research and development.Still others, including Arizona, Florida, Maine, New Jersey and New York, also want to cast light on the operations of pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, the giant buying networks that administer prescription plans on behalf of insurers.The theory behind PBMs is that their size and expertise results in savings for consumers. In recent years, however, critics have argued that the PBMs are pocketing the savings rather than passing them on to consumers. And in many states, the pharmacy benefit managers impose a gag order on pharmacists, blocking them from telling consumers about cheaper drug options.Other state legislators want to regulate PBMs. Legislators in Delaware, Minnesota and South Carolina have filed bills that would require PBMs to be licensed, so that the state could standardize their practices. While some states require PBMs to register with the state, only a few, such as Georgia and South Dakota, have licensing requirements.Lawmakers in Delaware, New Jersey, Texas and Virginia also want to end the practice of “clawbacks,” in which PBMs and insurance carriers pocket the difference between the total cost of a prescription drug and a patient’s copayment.

While a lot of people were asking where Sex Education was filmed, and what year is was supposed to be set in, a lot of people were also confused about why the teen cast weren't wearing school uniforms. Let's clear up some basics before we begin. The show is set in the UK (filmed in Wales) and it is supposed to set in the present day. But some details still confused viewers. For example, the school looked quite American - with its locker-lined hallways, school banners, students that drive to school or the inclusion of things like theatre clubs and jazz bands.- People are praising Sex Education's groundbreaking 'vagina-shaming' episode- Netflix's Sex Education creator teases what's next for Eric and Adam in season 2- 35 hilarious Sex Education memes that prove the Netflix series is better than sexNow that's not to say those things don't exist in UK schools, it's just that the school didn't necessarily look like what we usually think of when seeing UK schools on TV. Turns out this was quite deliberate, as the creator Laurie Nunn wanted to pay homage to John Hughes films of the 1980s and have a nostalgic backdrop. Ok. Fair enough. But, still, why don't they wear uniform? Some people on the internet were very pressed about it.When we sat down with Asa Butterfield, who plays Otis, and asked him about Moordale High, the fictional school where the show is set, Asa revealed why the teens on the show don't wear uniforms and the reason is surprisingly simple but very important to the show's success.""Moordale does have some special about it"", Asa said. ""When I got [the part] I asked Ben [Taylor - director] what's the uniform gonna be, because when you think of high school or British school shows you think of black and white uniforms and a bit grey and miserable"".""He said, 'There's no uniform. Everybody is just going to come with their own personality and their colour and everything is going to be quite vibrant.' I was like, that's cool, because that totally contradicts what you expect out of a British comedy drama set in school."" And when you think about it, what a difference it actually makes. It's impossible to imagine Eric without his colourful outfits or Maeve without her grungy, alternative aesthetic. Asa also compared Moordale to his own experience at school. Asa, who has been acting in TV and films from a young age, said it was easy to slip in and out of his studies because his friends and the school were very accepting of his work.""I found it relatively easy. The school was super supportive and all my friends they knew that I go away, I'm working, and then I'd come back to school - it worked out fine. I don't really have any other reference point because that was my life at the time. ""I know that for a lot of people it isn't that easy.

Unfortunately, this shouldn’t be a complete shock. In the years since Roe v. Wade, our culture has continued its downward trend to supporting death, not life. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act was sponsored by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., and came on the heels of comments last week from Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia insinuating that he supports infanticide in some instances. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., objected to the bill, arguing that the legislation is unnecessary, and thus preventing the bill from receiving unanimous consent. The liberal Left continue to push their radical agenda against American values. The good news is there is a solution. Find out more >> Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., pointed out that the Senate unanimously confirmed legislation congratulating New England Patriots on winning the Super Bowl but, sadly, couldn’t unify on behalf of a resolution condemning infanticide. Freshman Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., called upon American citizens to speak out against infanticide and added that he was surprised to encounter pro-infanticide sentiment so soon in his tenure. Braun is right to be horrified by the situation and he is right to ask citizens to speak out. But he should not be surprised to see pro-infanticide sentiment at this point in our nation’s history. In fact, he and other pro-life senators should expect not only a movement toward the legalization of infanticide but also arguments in favor of the legalization of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. Roe v. Wade legalized abortion by implicitly categorizing an unborn baby as the “personalty” (a legal term referring to one’s private property). Thus, ironically, merely a few years after America’s affirmation of the civil rights movement, the Supreme Court majority in Roe declared that there was, after all, an entire class of human beings—unborn babies—for whom there would be no guarantee of justice and equality. Regrettably, left-leaning jurists such as Justice John Paul Stevens supported the perverse logic of Roe by arguing that an unborn baby does not become a human being until the moment of birth. But such an argument is deeply incoherent; a being’s nature is not determined by its location. Furthermore, as Valparaiso University law professor Richard Stith argued 20 years ago, the incoherence of this progressive argument—that the moment of birth is a “bright line” at which an infant becomes a human being—may very well lead to the embrace of infanticide. In other words, since medical science makes clear that there is very little difference between a baby the day before birth and the day after birth, Stith speculated that progressive thought leaders would increasingly argue for the legalization of post-birth abortion. And that is exactly what has happened in ensuing years. Consider that in 2006, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology surprised many people when it issued a formal statement arguing that the United Kingdom should consider legalizing infanticide in the case of disabled babies. Euthanizing the baby, the statement said, would alleviate a family’s emotional and financial burdens. Or, consider the fact that many of the West’s most influential ethicists support infanticide. For example, John Harris, a founder of the International Association of Bioethics, argues that if abortion can be justified, so can infanticide. “There is no obvious reason,” Harris said, per a Telegraph article published in 2004, “why one should think differently, from an ethical point of view, about a fetus when it’s outside the womb rather than when it’s inside the womb.” Similarly, Jonathan Glover, senior ethicist at King’s College London, argues that there is no such thing as an inherent “sanctity of human life.” He argues that babies are not autonomous because they are not even aware of the difference between life and death. Thus, parents and medical personnel should evaluate whether or not the infant’s life is worth living. Even worse is the inevitability that the movement to legalize infanticide will be accompanied by a push to legalize euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. The career of Princeton University ethicist Peter Singer is case in point. Singer made his name by rejecting “the sanctity of human life” as nothing more than religious mumbo-jumbo, as he did in a 2009 Foreign Policy article. With the sanctity of human life thus rejected, he goes on to argue in favor of infanticide, voluntary euthanasia of the elderly, and physician-assisted suicide. In nations that have legislated along the lines of Singer’s utilitarian ethic, the results have been disastrous. Since the Netherlands legalized euthanasia nearly 20 years ago, doctors have taken the lives of thousands of elderly citizens annually. In the Netherlands’ culture of death, it is therefore not surprising that thousands of citizens carry cards prohibiting doctors from euthanizing them, and some elderly citizens express fear about going in for basic medical care because of the possibility of euthanasia. Recently, The Telegraph and the Daily Mail reported that a Dutch family had to hold down their mother, as she fought against being euthanized by her doctor. The patient, who was not named in the reports, suffered from dementia and had reportedly told medical officials that she wished to be euthanized when “the time was right.” And yet, even though she reportedly said “I don’t want to die” several times in the days leading up to the killing, the doctor, who was also not named, determined that the time was right, slipped a sedative into her coffee to relax her, and then tried to administer the lethal injection. The patient awoke and resisted the doctor, causing the physician to ask the family for help in holding down the patient down while he finished her off, per the reports. Northam’s support for infanticide and Murray’s objection to anti-infanticide legislation should not be viewed as insignificant. However, they should likewise not be seen as entirely surprising. Anti-life legislation is arguably the most consistent consequence of the culture of death enshrined in our legal code since Roe v. Wade. Northam and Murray represent a powerful movement to stay true to the ethic undergirding pro-abortion activism, and they are gaining support day by day. This unashamed movement to undermine the sanctity of human life must be resisted, not only by Congress but by the citizens of our great nation.

The Maine Farmer's Almanac first published ""Indian"" names for the full Moons in the 1930's. Some writers tie these names to the months of our modern calendar, but I think it more likely these names were tied to the seasons. As the last full Moon of winter, this Moon is called the Crow Moon, Crust Moon, Sap Moon, Sugar Moon, or Worm Moon. The more northern tribes of the northeastern United States knew this as the Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter. Other northern names were the Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing by night, or the Sap (or Sugar) Moon as this is the time for tapping maple trees. More southern tribes called this the Worm Moon after the earthworm casts that appear as the ground thaws. It makes sense that only the southern tribes called this the Worm Moon. When glaciers covered the northern part of North America they wiped out the native earthworms. These glaciers melted about 12,000 years ago and the more northern forests grew back without earthworms. The species of earthworms we have now in these areas are invasive species from Europe and Asia. The Europeans called this the Lenten Moon, as this Moon corresponds with Lent, and the next full Moon, the first full Moon in Spring, occurs just before Easter. Tying the Moon names to the European months, the full Moon in February is the Snow Moon or the Hunger Moon. Updating the tradition of naming Moons after prominent phenomena tied to the time of year, my friend Tom suggested naming this the Pothole Moon, and given what I ran into on my way home the last two evenings, this seems appropriate.The peak of this full Moon will occur only 6 hours, 50 minutes after perigee, making this a supermoon. The term ""supermoon"" was introduced by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979 and has become popular, particularly when it refers to a brighter than usual full Moon. By Richard Nolle's definition, the full Moons in January, February, and March of 2019 will be supermoons, with the February Moon the brightest of the three. In addition, full Moons during northern hemisphere winters tend to be brighter because the Earth and Moon are closer to the Sun and because the full Moon rides higher in the sky.In lunisolar calendars the months change with the new Moon and full Moons fall in the middle of the lunar months. This full Moon is the middle of the first month of the Chinese calendar. The 15th day of the first month is the Chinese Lantern Festival, the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations. Since twelve lunar months are about 11 days shorter than a solar year, lunisolar calendars add an occasional leap month to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons. In the Hebrew calendar this full Moon is in the middle of one of these leap months, the first Adar or Adar Aleph. In the Islamic calendar the months start with the first sighting of the waxing crescent Moon a few days after the New Moon. This full Moon is near the middle of Jumada al-Thani, the sixth month of the calendar.As usual, the wearing of suitably celebratory celestial attire is encouraged in honor of the full Moon.As for other celestial events between now and the full Moon after next:As winter ends, the daily periods of sunlight will be lengthening at nearly the fastest for the year. On the day of the full Moon on Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 5:56 AM, sunrise will be at 6:55 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 39.9 degrees at 12:22 PM, sunset will be at 5:50 PM, and evening twilight will end at 6:48 PM EST. On the last day of standard time, Saturday, March 9, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 5:32 AM, sunrise will be at 6:29 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 46.7 degrees at 12:19 PM, sunset will be at 6:09 PM, and evening twilight will end at 7:06 PM, all in EST. We ""spring forward"" into daylight savings time on Sunday, giving us an ""extra"" hour of sunlight in the evening but shifting the time of sunrise back to within a few minutes of when sunrise was in late December and early January. These are not the latest sunrises of the year. The latest sunrises come in late October and early November, just before we ""fall back"" to standard time. On Sunday, March 10, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 6:30 AM, sunrise will be at 7:27 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 47.1 degrees at 1:19 PM, sunset will be at 7:10 PM, and evening twilight will end at 8:07 PM, all in EDT. By the day of the full Moon after next, Wednesday, March 20, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 6:14 AM, sunrise will be at 7:12 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 51.0 degrees at 1:16 PM, sunset will be at 7:20 PM, and evening twilight will end at 8:18 PM EDT.On the evening of the full Moon on Feb. 19, 2019, as evening twilight ends, the bright stars of the local arm of our home galaxy, including the constellation Orion, will appear spread across the sky from the south-southeast to the northwest. The bright star appearing nearly overhead will be Capella. The planet Mars will appear in the west-southwest about 48 degrees above the horizon and the planet Mercury will appear in the west about 3 degrees above the horizon. As the month progresses, Mars will appear to shift gradually towards the west. Mercury will reach its greatest angular separation from the Sun (as seen from Earth) for this apparition on Feb. 26, appearing at its highest above the horizon (at the time evening twilight ends) on Feb. 27, 2019. After this, Mercury will appear to shift quickly towards the horizon and the setting Sun. By March 8, Mercury will be setting at the time evening twilight ends, will be lost in the glow of sunset a few days later, and pass between the Earth and the Sun (called Inferior Conjunction) on March 14, 2019, shifting from the evening sky into the morning sky. By the night of the full Moon on March 20, 2019, as evening twilight ends, the bright stars of the local arm and will Mars will appear to have shifted towards the west, with Mars appearing about 39 degrees above the horizon. The bright stars appearing nearly overhead will be Caster and Pollux, the twins in the constellation Gemini.On the morning of the full Moon on Feb. 19, 2019, as morning twilight begins, three planets will be visible. The brightest, Venus, as the Morning Star, will appear in the southeast about 12 degrees above the horizon, with Saturn appearing about 1.5 degrees to the right. They will be at their closest the day before, on Feb. 18, 2019. The second brightest planet, Jupiter, will appear in the south-southeast at about 25 degrees above the horizon. As the month progresses, Jupiter, Saturn, and the background of stars will appear to shift towards the west, while Venus gradually shifts to the east towards the horizon. By the morning of the full Moon on March 20, 2019, Jupiter will appear in the south about 28 degrees above the horizon, Saturn in the southeast at about 21 degrees above the horizon, and Venus in the east-southeast at about 6 degrees above the horizon. If you look about 30 minutes before sunrise, Mercury should just be starting to be visible, having passed between the Earth and the Sun on March 14, 2019.On Wednesday evening, Feb. 13, 2019, the bright star Aldebaran will appear to the lower left near the waxing gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 6:42 PM, the Moon will reach its highest in the sky for the night at 7:01 PM, and Aldebaran will set Thursday morning at 2:07 AM EST.Even though they are not visible usually, I include in these Moon missives information about Near Earth Objects (mostly asteroids) that pass the Earth within about 20 lunar distances, because I find it interesting that we have discovered so many. On Saturday afternoon, Feb. 16, 2019, at 1:35 PM EST (2019-Feb-16 18:35 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 CG5), between 11 and 24 meters (35 to 78 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 5.9 lunar distances, traveling at 8.91 kilometers per second (19,937 miles per hour).On Monday morning, Feb. 18, 2019, the bright planet Venus and the planet Saturn will appear nearest to each other in the morning sky, appearing about 12 degrees above the southeast horizon as morning twilight begins (at 5:58 AM EST for the Washington, DC area).Monday night into Tuesday morning, Feb. 18 to 19, 2019, the bright star that will appear to be shifting closer to the Moon throughout the night will be Regulus. Regulus will appear to the lower left of the Moon at the time the Moon is highest in the sky for the night (at midnight for the Washington, DC area), and will appear to shift closer until morning twilight begins (at 5:56 AM EST).Tuesday morning, Feb. 19, 2019, at 4:04 AM EST, the Moon will be at perigee, its closest to the Earth for this orbit. As mentioned above, the next full Moon will be on Tuesday morning, Feb. 19, 2019, at 10:54 AM EST (6 hours, 50 minutes after perigee, making this a supermoon). Tuesday evening, as evening twilight ends, Regulus will appear about 8 degrees to the upper right of the full Moon, and they will appear to shift apart as the evening progresses.On Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019, at 12:55 PM EST (2019-Feb-19 17:55 UTC), Near Earth Object (2013 MD8), between 38 and 86 meters (126 to 282 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 15.1 lunar distances, traveling at 13.60 kilometers per second (30,418 miles per hour).On Wednesday morning, Feb. 20, 2019, at around 3:44 AM EST (2019-Feb-20 08:44 UTC with 6 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CY1), between 20 and 45 meters (66 to 148 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 3.3 lunar distances, traveling at 13.36 kilometers per second (29,893 miles per hour).On Wednesday morning, Feb. 20, 2019, at 10:57 AM EST (2019-Feb-20 15:57 UTC), Near Earth Object 455176 (1999 VF22), between 202 and 451 meters (662 to 1,479 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 19.1 lunar distances, traveling at 26.48 kilometers per second (59,244 miles per hour).On Friday morning, Feb. 22, 2019, at 10:56 AM EST (2019-Feb-22 15:56 UTC), Near Earth Object (2016 CO246), between 18 and 39 meters (58 to 129 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 15.8 lunar distances, traveling at 5.52 kilometers per second (12,358 miles per hour).Friday night into Saturday morning, Feb. 22 to 23, 2019, the bright star Spica will appear to the lower right of the waning gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east at 9:40 PM, with Spica rising 17 minutes later, and the Moon will reach its highest in the sky at 3:39 AM EST.On Saturday morning, Feb. 23, 2019, at around 3:33 AM EST (2019-Feb-23 08:33 UTC with 4 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CK5), between 15 and 34 meters (50 to 112 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 13.1 and 13.6 lunar distances (nominally 13.3), traveling at 8.94 kilometers per second (19,994 miles per hour).On Saturday night, Feb. 23, 2019, 2019, at 10:22 PM EST (2019-Feb-24 03:22 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 BF1), between 92 and 206 meters (302 to 676 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 11.2 lunar distances, traveling at 9.13 kilometers per second (20,422 miles per hour).On Sunday morning, Feb. 24, 2019, at around 8:19 AM EST (2019-Feb-24 13:19 UTC with 1 hour, 35 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CK1), between 24 and 54 meters (80 to 178 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 16.0 and 16.8 lunar distances (nominally 16.4), traveling at 10.21 kilometers per second (22,828 miles per hour).On Monday morning, Feb. 25, 2019, at around 10:16 AM EST (2019-Feb-25 15:16 UTC with 24 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CJ), between 19 and 43 meters (63 to 141 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 7.3 and 7.5 lunar distances (nominally 7.4), traveling at 4.82 kilometers per second (10,772 miles per hour).On Tuesday morning, Feb. 26, 2019, at 5:24 AM EST (2019-Feb-26 10:24 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 CF4), between 11 and 24 meters (35 to 78 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 15.4 and 15.7 lunar distances (nominally 15.6), traveling at 3.73 kilometers per second (8,333 miles per hour).Tuesday morning, Feb. 26, 2019, the waning Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its last quarter at 6:28 AM EST.On Tuesday evening, Feb. 26, 2019, the planet Mercury will be at its greatest angular separation from the Sun as seen from the Earth, called greatest eastern elongation, appearing half full when viewed by telescope. Mercury will appear in the west about 6 degrees above the horizon.On Wednesday morning, Feb. 27, 2019, the 2nd brightest planet, Jupiter, will appear below the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 1:56 AM with Jupiter rising at 2:19 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Jupiter is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:46 AM.Sometime around Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019, (2019-Feb-27 16:09 UTC with 15 hours, 8 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2016 FU12), between 11 and 25 meters (36 to 81 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 12.7 and 20.1 lunar distances (nominally 15.4), traveling at 5.23 kilometers per second (11,706 miles per hour).On Wednesday evening, Feb. 27, 2019, the planet Mercury will appear at its highest above the western horizon for this apparition at the time evening twilight ends (around 6:56 PM EST for the Washington, DC area), appearing about 6 degrees above the horizon.On Friday morning, March 1, 2019, the planet Saturn will appear to the lower left of the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 3:44 AM and Saturn will rise at 4:01 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Saturn is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:43 AM.On Saturday morning, March 2, 2019, the brightest of the planets, Venus, will appear to the lower left of the waning crescent Moon, with Saturn appearing to the upper right. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 4:30 AM and Venus will rise at 4:42 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Venus is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:42 AM.Sometime around Saturday, March 2, 2019, (2019-Mar-02 20:56 UTC with 2 days, 1 hour, 4 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CT4), between 38 and 86 meters (126 to 282 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 5.0 and 7.5 lunar distances (nominally 6.2), traveling at 12.25 kilometers per second (27,406 miles per hour).Sunday morning, March 3, 2019, the waning crescent Moon will appear to have shifted to the lower left of Venus, rising (for the DC area) at 5:11 AM, about a half hour before morning twilight begins.On Sunday evening, March 3, 2019, at around 7:10 PM EST (2019-Mar-04 00:10 UTC with 34 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CX4), between 22 and 49 meters (73 to 162 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 18.0 and 18.8 lunar distances (nominally 18.4), traveling at 6.96 kilometers per second (15,575 miles per hour).Monday morning, March 4, 2019, at 6:25 AM EST, the Moon will be at apogee, its farthest from the Earth for this orbit. Following the sage advice of C. B. Boff, Monday, March 4th is a good day to march forth and do good deeds. My favorite poem by C. B. Boff is: ""Space it big, Light is fast, Time is long, Will mankind last?""On Monday morning, March 4, 2019, at around 8:23 AM EST (2019-Mar-04 13:23 UTC with 45 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CW), between 48 and 108 meters (159 to 355 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 19.1 and 19.3 lunar distances (nominally 19.2), traveling at 11.57 kilometers per second (25,877 miles per hour).On Monday afternoon, March 4, 2019, at 4:03 PM EST (2019-Mar-04 21:03 UTC), Near Earth Object (2015 EG), between 19 and 43 meters (63 to 141 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 1.1 lunar distances, traveling at 9.63 kilometers per second (21,545 miles per hour).Tuesday, March 5, 2019, will be Mardi Gras, also known as Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday, the traditional carnival on the last night before the 40 days of fasting for Lent. The date of Mardi Gras is 47 days before Easter, and Easter is tied to the first Sunday after the first full Moon of spring.Wednesday, March 6, 2019, at 11:04 AM EST, will be the new Moon, when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun and will not be visible from the Earth. The new Moon marks the start of the month in many lunisolar calendars. Sundown on March 6 marks the start of Adar II, also known as Adar Bet or Adar Sheni, in the Hebrew calendar. Since China Standard Time is 13 hours ahead of EST, the new Moon is after midnight in China, so Thursday, March 7, 2019, is the start of the second month of the Chinese calendar.Friday evening, March 8, 2019, if you have a clear view of the western horizon as evening twilight ends, you should be able to see the thin, waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, at least, this is the season when the waxing crescent Moon appears most like a smile or an upward-facing bowl in the evening sky, called a ""Cheshire Moon"" or a ""Wet Moon."" The term ""Cheshire moon"" is a reference to the smile of the Cheshire Cat of Lewis Carroll's story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. According to Wikipedia, the term ""Wet Moon"" originates from Hawaiian mythology, when the Moon appears like a bowl that could fill up with water. The period when this occurs roughly corresponds with Kaelo the Water Bearer in Hawaiian astrology. As the year passes into summer, the crescent shape tilts each lunar month, pouring out the water and causing the summer rains. In the Islamic calendar the months start with the first sighting of the waxing crescent Moon a few days after the New Moon. The sighting of this crescent Moon on Friday evening, March 8, 2019, should mark the beginning of Rajab, the seventh month of the year 1440. Rajab is one of the four sacred months in which warfare and fighting are forbidden.Sometime around Saturday, March 9, 2019, (2019-Mar-09 07:18 UTC with 3 days, 7 hours, 48 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2012 DF31), between 35 and 78 meters (115 to 257 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 9.1 and 34.1 lunar distances (nominally 9.1), traveling at 15.26 kilometers per second (34,142 miles per hour).Don't forget to ""Spring Forward"" as we begin Daylight Savings Time on Sunday morning, March 10, 2019. As reported on Car Talk, in the USA, 2 to 3 AM local time on the Sunday morning when daylight savings starts tends to be the safest hour on record, with no auto accidents reported (except in Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the non-Navajo regions of Arizona).Sometime on Monday, March 11, 2019, (2019-Mar-11 18:27 UTC with 8 hours, 12 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CM4), between 67 and 149 meters (219 to 490 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 13.3 and 14.2 lunar distances (nominally 13.8), traveling at 12.08 kilometers per second (27,020 miles per hour).On Monday evening, March 11, 2019, the planet Mars will appear about 8 degrees to he right of the waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:08 PM, Mars will set in the west-northwest at 11:51 PM, and the Moon will set Tuesday morning at 12:07 AM EDT.On Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning, March 12 to 13, 2019, the bright star Aldebaran will appear to the upper left of the waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:09 PM, and the pair will appear to move closer together until the Moon sets in the west-northwest Wednesday morning at 1:10 AM, with Aldebaran setting around 1:21 AM EDT.Sometime around Wednesday, March 13, 2019, (2019-Mar-13 05:48 UTC with 5 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2013 EG68), between 28 and 62 meters (91 to 204 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 11.8 and 82.1 lunar distances (nominally 19.3), traveling at 17.03 kilometers per second (38,088 miles per hour).Sometime around Wednesday, March 13, 2019, (2019-Mar-13 06:24 UTC with 3 days, 15 hours, 33 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2012 VZ19), between 20 and 45 meters (66 to 148 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 7.6 and 54.1 lunar distances (nominally 7.7), traveling at 8.04 kilometers per second (17,988 miles per hour).On Thursday morning, March 14, 2019, the Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its first quarter at 6:27 AM EDT.Thursday, March 14, 2019, at about 10 PM EDT, will be when the planet Mercury passes on the near side of the Sun as seen from Earth, called inferior conjunction.On Monday evening into Tuesday morning, March 18 to 19, 2019, the bright star Regulus will appear to the lower right of the nearly full waxing gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:16 PM, the Moon will reach its highest in the sky at 11:40 AM, and Regulus will set in the west-northwest at 6:12 AM EDT, just a few minutes before morning twilight begins.Sometime around Monday, March 18, 2019, (2019-Mar-19 00:40 UTC with 1 day, 13 hours, 28 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CL2), between 53 and 119 meters (174 to 389 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 9.7 and 10.8 lunar distances (nominally 10.3), traveling at 7.52 kilometers per second (16,817 miles per hour).Tuesday afternoon, March 19, 2019, at 3:47 PM EDT, the Moon will be at perigee, its closest to the Earth for this orbit.Sometime around Wednesday, March 20, 2019, (2019-Mar-20 11:38 UTC with 8 hours, 8 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CD5), between 97 and 216 meters (317 to 708 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 10.0 and 10.4 lunar distances (nominally 10.2), traveling at 17.04 kilometers per second (38,117 miles per hour).Wednesday evening, March 20, 2019, at 5:58 PM EDT, will be the vernal equinox, the astronomical start of spring. As mentioned above, the next full Moon will be on Wednesday, March 20, 2019, at 9:43 PM EDT, just a few hours after the start of spring.

February 2019: The Next Full Moon is the Crow Moon – NASA Solar System Exploration by Gordon JohnstonThe next full Moon will be on Tuesday morning, Feb. 19, 2019, appearing ""opposite"" the Sun (in Earth-based longitude) at 10:54 AM EST. The full Moon will appear full for about three days around this time, from Sunday night through Wednesday evening.This will be the last full Moon of winter. The Maine Farmer's Almanac first published ""Indian"" names for the full Moons in the 1930's. Some writers tie these names to the months of our modern calendar, but I think it more likely these names were tied to the seasons. As the last full Moon of winter, this Moon is called the Crow Moon, Crust Moon, Sap Moon, Sugar Moon, or Worm Moon. The more northern tribes of the northeastern United States knew this as the Crow Moon, when the cawing of crows signaled the end of winter. Other northern names were the Crust Moon, because the snow cover becomes crusted from thawing by day and freezing by night, or the Sap (or Sugar) Moon as this is the time for tapping maple trees. More southern tribes called this the Worm Moon after the earthworm casts that appear as the ground thaws. It makes sense that only the southern tribes called this the Worm Moon. When glaciers covered the northern part of North America they wiped out the native earthworms. These glaciers melted about 12,000 years ago and the more northern forests grew back without earthworms. The species of earthworms we have now in these areas are invasive species from Europe and Asia. The Europeans called this the Lenten Moon, as this Moon corresponds with Lent, and the next full Moon, the first full Moon in Spring, occurs just before Easter. Tying the Moon names to the European months, the full Moon in February is the Snow Moon or the Hunger Moon. Updating the tradition of naming Moons after prominent phenomena tied to the time of year, my friend Tom suggested naming this the Pothole Moon, and given what I ran into on my way home the last two evenings, this seems appropriate.The peak of this full Moon will occur only 6 hours, 50 minutes after perigee, making this a supermoon. The term ""supermoon"" was introduced by astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979 and has become popular, particularly when it refers to a brighter than usual full Moon. By Richard Nolle's definition, the full Moons in January, February, and March of 2019 will be supermoons, with the February Moon the brightest of the three. In addition, full Moons during northern hemisphere winters tend to be brighter because the Earth and Moon are closer to the Sun and because the full Moon rides higher in the sky.In lunisolar calendars the months change with the new Moon and full Moons fall in the middle of the lunar months. This full Moon is the middle of the first month of the Chinese calendar. The 15th day of the first month is the Chinese Lantern Festival, the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations. Since twelve lunar months are about 11 days shorter than a solar year, lunisolar calendars add an occasional leap month to keep the calendar in sync with the seasons. In the Hebrew calendar this full Moon is in the middle of one of these leap months, the first Adar or Adar Aleph. In the Islamic calendar the months start with the first sighting of the waxing crescent Moon a few days after the New Moon. This full Moon is near the middle of Jumada al-Thani, the sixth month of the calendar.As usual, the wearing of suitably celebratory celestial attire is encouraged in honor of the full Moon.As for other celestial events between now and the full Moon after next:As winter ends, the daily periods of sunlight will be lengthening at nearly the fastest for the year. On the day of the full Moon on Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 5:56 AM, sunrise will be at 6:55 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 39.9 degrees at 12:22 PM, sunset will be at 5:50 PM, and evening twilight will end at 6:48 PM EST. On the last day of standard time, Saturday, March 9, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 5:32 AM, sunrise will be at 6:29 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 46.7 degrees at 12:19 PM, sunset will be at 6:09 PM, and evening twilight will end at 7:06 PM, all in EST. We ""spring forward"" into daylight savings time on Sunday, giving us an ""extra"" hour of sunlight in the evening but shifting the time of sunrise back to within a few minutes of when sunrise was in late December and early January. These are not the latest sunrises of the year. The latest sunrises come in late October and early November, just before we ""fall back"" to standard time. On Sunday, March 10, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 6:30 AM, sunrise will be at 7:27 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 47.1 degrees at 1:19 PM, sunset will be at 7:10 PM, and evening twilight will end at 8:07 PM, all in EDT. By the day of the full Moon after next, Wednesday, March 20, 2019, morning twilight will begin at 6:14 AM, sunrise will be at 7:12 AM, the Sun will reach a maximum altitude of 51.0 degrees at 1:16 PM, sunset will be at 7:20 PM, and evening twilight will end at 8:18 PM EDT.On the evening of the full Moon on Feb. 19, 2019, as evening twilight ends, the bright stars of the local arm of our home galaxy, including the constellation Orion, will appear spread across the sky from the south-southeast to the northwest. The bright star appearing nearly overhead will be Capella. The planet Mars will appear in the west-southwest about 48 degrees above the horizon and the planet Mercury will appear in the west about 3 degrees above the horizon. As the month progresses, Mars will appear to shift gradually towards the west. Mercury will reach its greatest angular separation from the Sun (as seen from Earth) for this apparition on Feb. 26, appearing at its highest above the horizon (at the time evening twilight ends) on Feb. 27, 2019. After this, Mercury will appear to shift quickly towards the horizon and the setting Sun. By March 8, Mercury will be setting at the time evening twilight ends, will be lost in the glow of sunset a few days later, and pass between the Earth and the Sun (called Inferior Conjunction) on March 14, 2019, shifting from the evening sky into the morning sky. By the night of the full Moon on March 20, 2019, as evening twilight ends, the bright stars of the local arm and will Mars will appear to have shifted towards the west, with Mars appearing about 39 degrees above the horizon. The bright stars appearing nearly overhead will be Caster and Pollux, the twins in the constellation Gemini.On the morning of the full Moon on Feb. 19, 2019, as morning twilight begins, three planets will be visible. The brightest, Venus, as the Morning Star, will appear in the southeast about 12 degrees above the horizon, with Saturn appearing about 1.5 degrees to the right. They will be at their closest the day before, on Feb. 18, 2019. The second brightest planet, Jupiter, will appear in the south-southeast at about 25 degrees above the horizon. As the month progresses, Jupiter, Saturn, and the background of stars will appear to shift towards the west, while Venus gradually shifts to the east towards the horizon. By the morning of the full Moon on March 20, 2019, Jupiter will appear in the south about 28 degrees above the horizon, Saturn in the southeast at about 21 degrees above the horizon, and Venus in the east-southeast at about 6 degrees above the horizon. If you look about 30 minutes before sunrise, Mercury should just be starting to be visible, having passed between the Earth and the Sun on March 14, 2019.On Wednesday evening, Feb. 13, 2019, the bright star Aldebaran will appear to the lower left near the waxing gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 6:42 PM, the Moon will reach its highest in the sky for the night at 7:01 PM, and Aldebaran will set Thursday morning at 2:07 AM EST.Even though they are not visible usually, I include in these Moon missives information about Near Earth Objects (mostly asteroids) that pass the Earth within about 20 lunar distances, because I find it interesting that we have discovered so many. On Saturday afternoon, Feb. 16, 2019, at 1:35 PM EST (2019-Feb-16 18:35 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 CG5), between 11 and 24 meters (35 to 78 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 5.9 lunar distances, traveling at 8.91 kilometers per second (19,937 miles per hour).On Monday morning, Feb. 18, 2019, the bright planet Venus and the planet Saturn will appear nearest to each other in the morning sky, appearing about 12 degrees above the southeast horizon as morning twilight begins (at 5:58 AM EST for the Washington, DC area).Monday night into Tuesday morning, Feb. 18 to 19, 2019, the bright star that will appear to be shifting closer to the Moon throughout the night will be Regulus. Regulus will appear to the lower left of the Moon at the time the Moon is highest in the sky for the night (at midnight for the Washington, DC area), and will appear to shift closer until morning twilight begins (at 5:56 AM EST).Tuesday morning, Feb. 19, 2019, at 4:04 AM EST, the Moon will be at perigee, its closest to the Earth for this orbit. As mentioned above, the next full Moon will be on Tuesday morning, Feb. 19, 2019, at 10:54 AM EST (6 hours, 50 minutes after perigee, making this a supermoon). Tuesday evening, as evening twilight ends, Regulus will appear about 8 degrees to the upper right of the full Moon, and they will appear to shift apart as the evening progresses.On Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2019, at 12:55 PM EST (2019-Feb-19 17:55 UTC), Near Earth Object (2013 MD8), between 38 and 86 meters (126 to 282 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 15.1 lunar distances, traveling at 13.60 kilometers per second (30,418 miles per hour).On Wednesday morning, Feb. 20, 2019, at around 3:44 AM EST (2019-Feb-20 08:44 UTC with 6 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CY1), between 20 and 45 meters (66 to 148 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 3.3 lunar distances, traveling at 13.36 kilometers per second (29,893 miles per hour).On Wednesday morning, Feb. 20, 2019, at 10:57 AM EST (2019-Feb-20 15:57 UTC), Near Earth Object 455176 (1999 VF22), between 202 and 451 meters (662 to 1,479 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 19.1 lunar distances, traveling at 26.48 kilometers per second (59,244 miles per hour).On Friday morning, Feb. 22, 2019, at 10:56 AM EST (2019-Feb-22 15:56 UTC), Near Earth Object (2016 CO246), between 18 and 39 meters (58 to 129 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 15.8 lunar distances, traveling at 5.52 kilometers per second (12,358 miles per hour).Friday night into Saturday morning, Feb. 22 to 23, 2019, the bright star Spica will appear to the lower right of the waning gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east at 9:40 PM, with Spica rising 17 minutes later, and the Moon will reach its highest in the sky at 3:39 AM EST.On Saturday morning, Feb. 23, 2019, at around 3:33 AM EST (2019-Feb-23 08:33 UTC with 4 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CK5), between 15 and 34 meters (50 to 112 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 13.1 and 13.6 lunar distances (nominally 13.3), traveling at 8.94 kilometers per second (19,994 miles per hour).On Saturday night, Feb. 23, 2019, 2019, at 10:22 PM EST (2019-Feb-24 03:22 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 BF1), between 92 and 206 meters (302 to 676 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 11.2 lunar distances, traveling at 9.13 kilometers per second (20,422 miles per hour).On Sunday morning, Feb. 24, 2019, at around 8:19 AM EST (2019-Feb-24 13:19 UTC with 1 hour, 35 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CK1), between 24 and 54 meters (80 to 178 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 16.0 and 16.8 lunar distances (nominally 16.4), traveling at 10.21 kilometers per second (22,828 miles per hour).On Monday morning, Feb. 25, 2019, at around 10:16 AM EST (2019-Feb-25 15:16 UTC with 24 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CJ), between 19 and 43 meters (63 to 141 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 7.3 and 7.5 lunar distances (nominally 7.4), traveling at 4.82 kilometers per second (10,772 miles per hour).On Tuesday morning, Feb. 26, 2019, at 5:24 AM EST (2019-Feb-26 10:24 UTC), Near Earth Object (2019 CF4), between 11 and 24 meters (35 to 78 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 15.4 and 15.7 lunar distances (nominally 15.6), traveling at 3.73 kilometers per second (8,333 miles per hour).Tuesday morning, Feb. 26, 2019, the waning Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its last quarter at 6:28 AM EST.On Tuesday evening, Feb. 26, 2019, the planet Mercury will be at its greatest angular separation from the Sun as seen from the Earth, called greatest eastern elongation, appearing half full when viewed by telescope. Mercury will appear in the west about 6 degrees above the horizon.On Wednesday morning, Feb. 27, 2019, the 2nd brightest planet, Jupiter, will appear below the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 1:56 AM with Jupiter rising at 2:19 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Jupiter is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:46 AM.Sometime around Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2019, (2019-Feb-27 16:09 UTC with 15 hours, 8 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2016 FU12), between 11 and 25 meters (36 to 81 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 12.7 and 20.1 lunar distances (nominally 15.4), traveling at 5.23 kilometers per second (11,706 miles per hour).On Wednesday evening, Feb. 27, 2019, the planet Mercury will appear at its highest above the western horizon for this apparition at the time evening twilight ends (around 6:56 PM EST for the Washington, DC area), appearing about 6 degrees above the horizon.On Friday morning, March 1, 2019, the planet Saturn will appear to the lower left of the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 3:44 AM and Saturn will rise at 4:01 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Saturn is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:43 AM.On Saturday morning, March 2, 2019, the brightest of the planets, Venus, will appear to the lower left of the waning crescent Moon, with Saturn appearing to the upper right. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east-southeast at 4:30 AM and Venus will rise at 4:42 AM EST. They will appear to shift closer together until Venus is lost in the glow of dawn, with morning twilight beginning at 5:42 AM.Sometime around Saturday, March 2, 2019, (2019-Mar-02 20:56 UTC with 2 days, 1 hour, 4 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CT4), between 38 and 86 meters (126 to 282 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 5.0 and 7.5 lunar distances (nominally 6.2), traveling at 12.25 kilometers per second (27,406 miles per hour).Sunday morning, March 3, 2019, the waning crescent Moon will appear to have shifted to the lower left of Venus, rising (for the DC area) at 5:11 AM, about a half hour before morning twilight begins.On Sunday evening, March 3, 2019, at around 7:10 PM EST (2019-Mar-04 00:10 UTC with 34 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CX4), between 22 and 49 meters (73 to 162 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 18.0 and 18.8 lunar distances (nominally 18.4), traveling at 6.96 kilometers per second (15,575 miles per hour).Monday morning, March 4, 2019, at 6:25 AM EST, the Moon will be at apogee, its farthest from the Earth for this orbit. Following the sage advice of C. B. Boff, Monday, March 4th is a good day to march forth and do good deeds. My favorite poem by C. B. Boff is: ""Space it big, Light is fast, Time is long, Will mankind last?""On Monday morning, March 4, 2019, at around 8:23 AM EST (2019-Mar-04 13:23 UTC with 45 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CW), between 48 and 108 meters (159 to 355 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 19.1 and 19.3 lunar distances (nominally 19.2), traveling at 11.57 kilometers per second (25,877 miles per hour).On Monday afternoon, March 4, 2019, at 4:03 PM EST (2019-Mar-04 21:03 UTC), Near Earth Object (2015 EG), between 19 and 43 meters (63 to 141 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at 1.1 lunar distances, traveling at 9.63 kilometers per second (21,545 miles per hour).Tuesday, March 5, 2019, will be Mardi Gras, also known as Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday, the traditional carnival on the last night before the 40 days of fasting for Lent. The date of Mardi Gras is 47 days before Easter, and Easter is tied to the first Sunday after the first full Moon of spring.Wednesday, March 6, 2019, at 11:04 AM EST, will be the new Moon, when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun and will not be visible from the Earth. The new Moon marks the start of the month in many lunisolar calendars. Sundown on March 6 marks the start of Adar II, also known as Adar Bet or Adar Sheni, in the Hebrew calendar. Since China Standard Time is 13 hours ahead of EST, the new Moon is after midnight in China, so Thursday, March 7, 2019, is the start of the second month of the Chinese calendar.Friday evening, March 8, 2019, if you have a clear view of the western horizon as evening twilight ends, you should be able to see the thin, waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, at least, this is the season when the waxing crescent Moon appears most like a smile or an upward-facing bowl in the evening sky, called a ""Cheshire Moon"" or a ""Wet Moon."" The term ""Cheshire moon"" is a reference to the smile of the Cheshire Cat of Lewis Carroll's story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. According to Wikipedia, the term ""Wet Moon"" originates from Hawaiian mythology, when the Moon appears like a bowl that could fill up with water. The period when this occurs roughly corresponds with Kaelo the Water Bearer in Hawaiian astrology. As the year passes into summer, the crescent shape tilts each lunar month, pouring out the water and causing the summer rains. In the Islamic calendar the months start with the first sighting of the waxing crescent Moon a few days after the New Moon. The sighting of this crescent Moon on Friday evening, March 8, 2019, should mark the beginning of Rajab, the seventh month of the year 1440. Rajab is one of the four sacred months in which warfare and fighting are forbidden.Sometime around Saturday, March 9, 2019, (2019-Mar-09 07:18 UTC with 3 days, 7 hours, 48 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2012 DF31), between 35 and 78 meters (115 to 257 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 9.1 and 34.1 lunar distances (nominally 9.1), traveling at 15.26 kilometers per second (34,142 miles per hour).Don't forget to ""Spring Forward"" as we begin Daylight Savings Time on Sunday morning, March 10, 2019. As reported on Car Talk, in the USA, 2 to 3 AM local time on the Sunday morning when daylight savings starts tends to be the safest hour on record, with no auto accidents reported (except in Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the non-Navajo regions of Arizona).Sometime on Monday, March 11, 2019, (2019-Mar-11 18:27 UTC with 8 hours, 12 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CM4), between 67 and 149 meters (219 to 490 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 13.3 and 14.2 lunar distances (nominally 13.8), traveling at 12.08 kilometers per second (27,020 miles per hour).On Monday evening, March 11, 2019, the planet Mars will appear about 8 degrees to he right of the waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:08 PM, Mars will set in the west-northwest at 11:51 PM, and the Moon will set Tuesday morning at 12:07 AM EDT.On Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning, March 12 to 13, 2019, the bright star Aldebaran will appear to the upper left of the waxing crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:09 PM, and the pair will appear to move closer together until the Moon sets in the west-northwest Wednesday morning at 1:10 AM, with Aldebaran setting around 1:21 AM EDT.Sometime around Wednesday, March 13, 2019, (2019-Mar-13 05:48 UTC with 5 days, 7 hours, 46 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2013 EG68), between 28 and 62 meters (91 to 204 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 11.8 and 82.1 lunar distances (nominally 19.3), traveling at 17.03 kilometers per second (38,088 miles per hour).Sometime around Wednesday, March 13, 2019, (2019-Mar-13 06:24 UTC with 3 days, 15 hours, 33 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2012 VZ19), between 20 and 45 meters (66 to 148 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 7.6 and 54.1 lunar distances (nominally 7.7), traveling at 8.04 kilometers per second (17,988 miles per hour).On Thursday morning, March 14, 2019, the Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its first quarter at 6:27 AM EDT.Thursday, March 14, 2019, at about 10 PM EDT, will be when the planet Mercury passes on the near side of the Sun as seen from Earth, called inferior conjunction.On Monday evening into Tuesday morning, March 18 to 19, 2019, the bright star Regulus will appear to the lower right of the nearly full waxing gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, evening twilight will end at 8:16 PM, the Moon will reach its highest in the sky at 11:40 AM, and Regulus will set in the west-northwest at 6:12 AM EDT, just a few minutes before morning twilight begins.Sometime around Monday, March 18, 2019, (2019-Mar-19 00:40 UTC with 1 day, 13 hours, 28 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CL2), between 53 and 119 meters (174 to 389 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 9.7 and 10.8 lunar distances (nominally 10.3), traveling at 7.52 kilometers per second (16,817 miles per hour).Tuesday afternoon, March 19, 2019, at 3:47 PM EDT, the Moon will be at perigee, its closest to the Earth for this orbit.Sometime around Wednesday, March 20, 2019, (2019-Mar-20 11:38 UTC with 8 hours, 8 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2019 CD5), between 97 and 216 meters (317 to 708 feet) in size, will pass the Earth at between 10.0 and 10.4 lunar distances (nominally 10.2), traveling at 17.04 kilometers per second (38,117 miles per hour).Wednesday evening, March 20, 2019, at 5:58 PM EDT, will be the vernal equinox, the astronomical start of spring. As mentioned above, the next full Moon will be on Wednesday, March 20, 2019, at 9:43 PM EDT, just a few hours after the start of spring.

29,Climate Change,Is Human Activity Primarily Responsible for Global Climate Change?,2s29q7r,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/cowboys-politics-climate-immigration-poetry-nevada,What happens when you put cowboys in a room to talk politics? | US news | The Guardian,"At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Nevada, friends and performers with wide-ranging views met to discuss climate change, immigration and other concerns ‘without demonizing each other’by Carson Vaughan Tue 19 Feb 2019 11.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 19 Feb 2019 19.26 GMT Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers.“None of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,” he wrote.“If we can’t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?“Maybe,” he added, “we could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.”Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends – some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between – who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.In other circles, Steiger’s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.“These people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,” he later told me. “I didn’t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I’m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I’m going to be watching MSNBC. I’m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.”The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko’s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the “talking stick” back and forth and striving unsuccessfully – like newcomers to a board game – to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with “a different brand of politics”. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.“They’d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, ‘What is best for Arizona?’ They really tried hard to do that.”But he’d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone “blowing smoke” to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father’s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then-governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.“He stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take – you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,” he says, crossing his fingers. “This guy had sincerity like you wouldn’t believe.”“We’re packing up, and I can hear [Reagan’s assistant] leading him out there in the room and he goes, ‘Okay, Governor. This guy is the beer distributor. This guy started these little stores called Circle K … That light came on and it was like, holy shit! This guy’s an actor. He’s been practicing lines and making you believe him his whole life. This is show business.”Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work; he’s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common – an intimate connection to the land.“If climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels …is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we’ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,” he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. “If the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we’ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.”Steiger’s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the “overwhelming majority” of whom he found “to be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes”. He’d rather see the US focus its time and money on the “economic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here”.Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and “true cowboys” he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots; his parents sent him a box of old books instead. “I thought it was the worst present ever,” he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally dived in. “To this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.”It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he’d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management’s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands.“We should not allow these unconstitutional, martial-law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,” he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016.Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime “substantial” and says he stands with “the scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one"".“No matter our feelings on climate change, we need to clean up our act, steward all of our eco-systems as they are all interrelated. Try to help earth live in her natural state,” he wrote the group. “Our children and grandchildren will have to live with the air, water and policies we leave for them. If humankind is not responsible for the earth’s climate change, we are [still] responsible for how we live and the messes we make.”As for immigration: “When they [immigrants] break the law coming to this country, we take it too lightly. I don’t feel we should feel obliged to house, feed, give medical attention or financial assistance to those here illegally. I believe we should do better helping the Native peoples, to care for our own sick, those who go home to die because they can’t afford medical costs,” he wrote. “I prescribe to family, tribe and America first, then our somewhat flawed policies and prescribed path to citizenship.”Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was “crippled”, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors’ whims and his mother’s whimsy, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.“It created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers. And that’s my little problem with authority.”At 15, he ran away from home and spent the rest of his teenage years hiring himself out at various ranches, earning $20 a month and attending roughly nine high schools before finally cobbling together enough credits to graduate. He kept working as a ranch hand until he met his wife, who purchased a farm and ranch in the San Luis Valley. They’ve lived there ever since.Quinlan doesn’t question whether the climate is changing – it always has, he says – but he’s hardly convinced it’s a manmade issue, nor does he place any faith in warnings from “publish-or-perish scientists and professors” whom he believes are often bought and paid for by corporate interests. “The same agencies and scientists that are now predicting manmade global disaster,” he says, were predicting the same when he first moved to the valley in 1970.“But it didn’t really matter: the experts were predicting a coming famine because other farmers were even dumber than me and allowing erosion to wash all their topsoil into the Gulf of Mexico and would soon be trying to plant their soybeans on bedrock,” he wrote. “And besides, we were running out of fossil fuel and would soon be reading by candlelight and canning our meat. What meat we had left was from ranchers even dumber than farmers who were destroying their pastures by overgrazing.”Like Steiger, he’s worked with many undocumented immigrants over the years, almost all of whom were “decent people and good hands”. If he were living in the same conditions they fled from, he says – the cartel violence and economic despair – he’d do the same.“I would be here asking John for a job picking fruit in his orchards, or asking Gail for day work on the Spider Ranch. If caught and sent back, I would start walking north as soon as I got off the bus.”And though he believes America has a responsibility to “develop a fair, affordable, and accessible immigration system”, he also considers tight border security a moral imperative: “I think it is immoral when we steal the best and brightest from poor countries by not controlling our border. Most of the illegals I worked with over the years were a credit to this country and would have … been a credit to their own if given a chance at a decent life.”Zarzyski grew up in awe of his father, an iron ore miner in Hurley, Wisconsin, and the brute force with which he approached every facet of his life, whether a mile deep in the hematite mine or “making firewood”.From an early age, he learned to throw his everything into everything. It’s an ethic he carried to graduate school at the University of Montana, where he studied poetry under the celebrated American poet Richard Hugo and began competing as a bareback bronc rider. He kept at both until his mid-30s, subsisting on occasional winnings from the rodeo circuit, meager paychecks from a part-time teaching gig at the university, and the scraps he earned from his published work. Serendipitously, just as his body began to give out, he found a wider community for his work through the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering.Few who are familiar with his work would be shocked to learn Zarzyski – one of the few here to write in mostly free verse – is liberal. Still, he makes it a point to step aside from politics each year when he enters Elko county, and he has dedicated more than a few poems to close friends across the aisle.“If you’re asking, ‘Do I bring it out in the open verbally?’ the answer is no. It would be an extreme violation of all the goodness this gathering has stood for,” he says. “I have witnessed year after year people making pilgrimages here because they’re in need of something missing from their lives that they can’t quite articulate, but they had a pretty strong instinct that if they came here, they would be graced with that mecca-something or other, and they almost always inevitably are.”Outside the confines of the gathering, however, he rarely holds back. Consider the final stanza of his unpublished poem, Knock-Knock-Knocking On Doomsday’s Door, which lampoons both humanity’s stupidity in the face of climate change, and the seemingly futile nature of his own work in the face of global crisis.…This poem,then, exists only to sift its own ashenbone-fragment remainsthrough its own chaliced fingersraised in a pathetic gestureof reckoning, raised to the billowing God-cloud of what was onceeach and every miracle, eachand every mystery, each and everymolecule of merciful matterthis poem held dear – of what wasonce living, breathingtwice-blest you … me … them … us … it.Cognizant of his own half-Italian, half-Polish ancestry and their passage through Ellis Island, Zarzyski strongly identifies with those immigrants fleeing dire circumstances in their home countries.“They came here to give, as well as to receive … and I’m not convinced that the larger majority of immigrants seeking security and safety for their families today do not harbor similar sensibilities as did our European immigrants,” he writes.“I understand, as well, that the ‘green new deal’ coupled with the long-overdue rebuilding of infrastructure in this country is not the panacea to all that ails us, but I can’t help but wonder just how integral – how ‘symbiotic,’ if you will – are the solutions to immigration and climate change? Bottom line, it’s’ all going to come down to fresh perspectives and an entirely new way of applying hard work, white- and blue-collar work alike, to save us from ourselves, from destroying this glorious orb that gives everyone of us our, and everything its, existence.”A fifth-generation cattleman in Tulare county, California, John Dofflemyer “weaned” himself on the poetry of Gary Snyder, which he first encountered as a teenager while packing mules in the Sierra Nevada. “I ran across his work and just came undone,” he says. “His poetry really spoke to me in that minimalistic form. Gary doesn’t use a lot of multisyllabic words, and I realized, shit, I was capable of writing.”After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Southern California, distractedly studying business, certain “my graduation present would be an AR-15 and some camo gear”. But he failed the draft physical with a bum knee from a rugby injury and instead returned home to work the family ranch full-time. After first performing at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1989, he launched the quarterly Dry Crik Review, encouraging verse grounded less in the past than the cowboy present, the challenges and opportunities facing ranchers today. Though he no longer prints the physical chapbooks, he continues to publish his own work on the Dry Crik Journal website. Work like The Climate of Change, in which he finally asks:How long can we be entertainedby delusion, the dissolutionof civility, of compassionas the planet preparesfor the business of war –already overstocked with banksof houses stacked uponthe fading fruited plains?Dofflemyer often resists crediting human activity for global warming, but either way, he wrote: “It’s only prudent to make provisions for a warmer and drier climate where we can.”As for immigration: “Congress needs to address our immigration policy in a practical and humane way. Separating children from their parents and holding immigrants in concentration camps is no better strategy than completing the construction of a wall that has been tunneled under for decades. Instead of a political bargaining chip, the Daca program needs to be resolved compassionately.”An anti-war demonstrator during his college years, he admits he’s lately grown fatalistic, that he views his own political involvement as “a futile exercise.” And perhaps more importantly, he says, “relationships with neighboring ranchers are too vital and important for us to jeopardize, so it’s out of respect for them and getting along that we don’t discuss politics.”Later that week, as visitors flooded downtown Elko and the group scattered to fulfill their various performance schedules, each of them told me separately they had never held any hopes of changing anyone’s mind and were certain no one had. Still, they were curious to see how the night would play out.A few of them felt the exercise was important, a test of their friendship, an affront to the larger partisan forces currently alienating friends and relatives. Though none of them tested the waters again – certainly not on stage – they regretted little more than their own mismanagement of the dialogue. They had opined too much, or their questions had been too narrow, or they had lost track of the order. They had never gotten around to income inequality.“I don’t have any illusions of saving the world, but you do what you can,” Steiger says. “And I will tell you that I feel a lot better after trying than I did just ranting and raving about those stupid son-of-a-guns who don’t agree with me.”…we can’t turn away from the climate crisis.

What happens when you put cowboys in a room to talk politics? | US news | The Guardian At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Nevada, friends and performers with wide-ranging views met to discuss climate change, immigration and other concerns ‘without demonizing each other’by Carson Vaughan Tue 19 Feb 2019 11.00 GMT Last modified on Tue 19 Feb 2019 19.26 GMT Several weeks ahead of the 35th annual National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada, Gail Steiger, a rancher and singer-songwriter from Yavapai county, Arizona, emailed a proposal to a small host of close friends and fellow performers.“None of us fit easily in any box, but we all hold each other in high regard,” he wrote.“If we can’t talk to each other about the future course of our country, who can?“Maybe,” he added, “we could see if old friends can at least have a conversation about these issues without demonizing each other.”Steiger was proposing a political rendezvous amongst friends – some Republicans, some Democrats, some in the wild, open range in between – who have largely avoided the subject for their more than 30-year history together.In other circles, Steiger’s request may have seemed commonplace. At the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, a weeklong festival of western poetry and song cherished by thousands for its cultivation of community, it was a perilous suggestion. More than a few performers, they say, have shot themselves in the foot proselytizing in Elko. Of the five poets Steiger initially invited to participate in his offsite roundtable, two respectfully declined.The rodeo poet Paul Zarzyski, a diehard liberal from Great Falls, Montana, was one of them.“These people are so locked in. I was going to run head-on in that room,” he later told me. “I didn’t need that here. Elko might be the one place I can come to and disconnect. When I go back, I’m going to be looking on Huffington Post in the morning. I’m going to be watching MSNBC. I’m going to be thrown right back in again and this is a little sanctuary for five or six days.”The rest of them quietly gathered in the old Hotel West, the Basque steakhouse next door boisterous with tourists and townies, the blinking lights of Elko’s tiny brothel district visible from the back door. They sat around a large dining room table, discussing climate change and immigration, passing the “talking stick” back and forth and striving unsuccessfully – like newcomers to a board game – to follow the rigid guidelines of a Socratic dialogue: more questions, fewer opinions.The son of a rancher and five-term Arizona congressman, Gail Steiger grew up with “a different brand of politics”. He used to accompany his father Sam to the weekly meetings of the Arizona delegation, and though all but one of them were Republican, he says, the lone Democrat commanded equal respect at the table.“They’d laugh about that, but they were friends! They would sit down and say, ‘What is best for Arizona?’ They really tried hard to do that.”But he’d never harbored any particular fantasy of a career in politics, not after watching the way it skewed so many simple encounters into perverse transactions, everyone “blowing smoke” to gain access to his father. After he dropped out of college to help run his father’s Senate campaign in 1976, he shut the door on politics for good, suddenly all too aware of just how manipulative and hollow the enterprise could be. The final straw was an encounter with the then-governor, Ronald Reagan, who agreed to endorse his father.“He stands right on his mark and he looks at that camera and in one take – you would have sworn that he and my father had known each other their whole lives and they were just like this,” he says, crossing his fingers. “This guy had sincerity like you wouldn’t believe.”“We’re packing up, and I can hear [Reagan’s assistant] leading him out there in the room and he goes, ‘Okay, Governor. This guy is the beer distributor. This guy started these little stores called Circle K … That light came on and it was like, holy shit! This guy’s an actor. He’s been practicing lines and making you believe him his whole life. This is show business.”Finally disillusioned by politics, Steiger earned a business degree in Colorado, took a summer job working cattle back in Arizona and gradually fell in love with the work; he’s been running cattle ever since. He credits the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering with shifting his perspective on environmental stewardship. The forum in Elko, which mixes ranchers and environmentalists, conservatives and liberals, helped him see what both groups have in common – an intimate connection to the land.“If climate science suggesting we should take steps to reduce our use of fossil fuels …is in error,and we take the suggested action anyway, the downside will be that we’ve left more fossil fuel in the ground for our descendants,” he wrote to those involved in the roundtable discussion. “If the preponderance of climate science is correct, and we do nothing to alter our carbon footprint, the downside will be that we’ve rendered our planet uninhabitable for humans and many other species, all for the short term gains of those who currently benefit most from the status quo.”Steiger’s views on immigration stem primarily from his own experience working with undocumented immigrants in Arizona, the “overwhelming majority” of whom he found “to be honest, hardworking people who did their jobs, supported their families and paid their taxes”. He’d rather see the US focus its time and money on the “economic conditions, lawlessness, violence and desperation that causes people in Mexico and Central America to seek asylum here”.Born and raised on a ranch near Jiggs, Nevada, a ghost town 36 miles south of Elko, Waddie Mitchell quit school at 16 years old. Like the cattlemen and “true cowboys” he idolized as kid, he soon found himself starting colts for a nearby ranch and living alone in a tiny bunkhouse with little but his own imagination to occupy him.That first winter alone, he was desperate for thicker gloves and new boots; his parents sent him a box of old books instead. “I thought it was the worst present ever,” he says. But the isolation got the best of him. He finally dived in. “To this day, I think it was the best present I ever got.”It planted the first seed of what would later become a full-time career in the arts, writing and performing cowboy poetry for audiences across the country, from Elko to The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In between, he’d buckaroo all over the west, serve a tour in Vietnam, break horses for the US Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado, get married, raise five kids, and help found the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in 1985.In recent years, Mitchell has been an outspoken supporter of the Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, whose refusal to pay federal grazing fees led to an armed standoff in 2014 with government agents. Mitchell has written a host of op-eds for the local newspaper arguing against government overreach and the Bureau of Land Management’s treatment of ranchers whose roots in the area predate the enforcement of grazing limits on federal lands.“We should not allow these unconstitutional, martial-law minded BLM globs to abuse power THEY GAVE THEMSELVES, against citizens who, unlike the tax suckers, actually produce something,” he wrote in the Elko Daily Free Press in January 2016.Like the poet John Dofflemyer at the other end of the table, Mitchell stops short of declaring global warming a manmade issue, but he calls the increase in extreme weather events in his lifetime “substantial” and says he stands with “the scientists, not the petroleum pamphlets, on this one"".“No matter our feelings on climate change, we need to clean up our act, steward all of our eco-systems as they are all interrelated. Try to help earth live in her natural state,” he wrote the group. “Our children and grandchildren will have to live with the air, water and policies we leave for them. If humankind is not responsible for the earth’s climate change, we are [still] responsible for how we live and the messes we make.”As for immigration: “When they [immigrants] break the law coming to this country, we take it too lightly. I don’t feel we should feel obliged to house, feed, give medical attention or financial assistance to those here illegally. I believe we should do better helping the Native peoples, to care for our own sick, those who go home to die because they can’t afford medical costs,” he wrote. “I prescribe to family, tribe and America first, then our somewhat flawed policies and prescribed path to citizenship.”Vess Quinlan was 10 years old when he contracted polio. One day he was helping his uncle break horses on a ranch near Eagle, Colorado. The next he was “crippled”, he says, confined to the hospital for a year, subject to the doctors’ whims and his mother’s whimsy, neither of which allowed for even the slightest suggestion of a return to the ranch. He killed the time reading Will James and the poems his grandmother had clipped from the livestock papers and collected in a shoebox, tranquillized by a stiff cocktail of existential despair.His mother eventually moved the family to Pueblo, Colorado, where his teachers tried their best to steer him towards more intellectual pursuits. But the cowboy never left him, and his heart remained at the ranch.“It created this huge conflict with everybody around me. With my folks, with my teachers.

49,National Anthem Protest,Is Refusing to Stand for the National Anthem an Appropriate Form of Protest?,1s49q2r,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem,Colin Kaepernick explains why he sat during national anthem - NFL.com,"  SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States. His latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night. ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" The 49ers issued a statement about Kaepernick's decision: ""The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.""Niners coach Chip Kelly told reporters Saturday that Kaepernick's decision not to stand during the national anthem is ""his right as a citizen"" and said ""it's not my right to tell him not to do something.""The NFL also released a statement, obtained by NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport: ""Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem."" By taking a stand for civil rights, Kaepernick, 28, joins other athletes, like the NBA's Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and several WNBA players in using their platform and status to raise awareness to issues affecting minorities in the U.S. However, refusal to support the American flag as a means to take a stand has brought incredible backlash before and likely will in this instance. The NBA's Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf of the Denver Nuggets, formerly Chris Jackson before converting to Islam, refused to acknowledge the flag in protest, citing similar reasons as Kaepernick and saying that it conflicted with some of his Islamic beliefs. Abdul-Rauf drew the ire of fans and was briefly suspended by the NBA before a compromise was worked out between the league and player, who eventually stood with his teammates and coaches at the playing of the national anthem. Kaepernick said that he is aware of what he is doing and that he knows it will not sit well with a lot of people, including the 49ers. He said that he did not inform the club or anyone affiliated with the team of his intentions to protest the national anthem. ""This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,"" he said. ""I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ... If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.""Kaepernick said that he has thought about going public with his feelings for a while but that ""I felt that I needed to understand the situation better.""He said that he has discussed his feelings with his family and, after months of witnessing some of the civil unrest in the U.S., decided to be more active and involved in rights for black people.

Colin Kaepernick explains why he sat during national anthem - NFL.com   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States. His latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night. ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" The 49ers issued a statement about Kaepernick's decision: ""The national anthem is and always will be a special part of the pre-game ceremony. It is an opportunity to honor our country and reflect on the great liberties we are afforded as its citizens. In respecting such American principles as freedom of religion and freedom of expression, we recognize the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem.""Niners coach Chip Kelly told reporters Saturday that Kaepernick's decision not to stand during the national anthem is ""his right as a citizen"" and said ""it's not my right to tell him not to do something.""The NFL also released a statement, obtained by NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport: ""Players are encouraged but not required to stand during the playing of the national anthem."" By taking a stand for civil rights, Kaepernick, 28, joins other athletes, like the NBA's Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony and several WNBA players in using their platform and status to raise awareness to issues affecting minorities in the U.S. However, refusal to support the American flag as a means to take a stand has brought incredible backlash before and likely will in this instance. The NBA's Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf of the Denver Nuggets, formerly Chris Jackson before converting to Islam, refused to acknowledge the flag in protest, citing similar reasons as Kaepernick and saying that it conflicted with some of his Islamic beliefs. Abdul-Rauf drew the ire of fans and was briefly suspended by the NBA before a compromise was worked out between the league and player, who eventually stood with his teammates and coaches at the playing of the national anthem. Kaepernick said that he is aware of what he is doing and that he knows it will not sit well with a lot of people, including the 49ers. He said that he did not inform the club or anyone affiliated with the team of his intentions to protest the national anthem. ""This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,"" he said. ""I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed. ... If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right.""Kaepernick said that he has thought about going public with his feelings for a while but that ""I felt that I needed to understand the situation better.""He said that he has discussed his feelings with his family and, after months of witnessing some of the civil unrest in the U.S., decided to be more active and involved in rights for black people.

According to Samantha, Fivecoate explained that she believed marriage was between a man and a woman and that she would therefore not be able to prepare their taxes.The incident, on Feb. 12, left the Brazzels feeling “shocked, upset, and kind of hurt,” Samantha told The Washington Post. “Our marriage is just as legal and valid as anybody else’s.” She and her wife left the business and posted their story in a local Facebook group to warn other same-sex couples.

The organization decided that decriminalization is the best way to defend sex workers’ human rights and lessen the risk of abuse they face. But will making prostitution legal only increase the demand for sex workers, without actually protecting them from the violent abuse and exploitation that is common in the industry? Should prostitution be legal?Rachel Moran, the founder of Space International, which advocates the abolition of the sex trade, argues in this Op-Ed that prostitution should not be legal: I entered the sex trade — as most do — before I was even a woman. At age 14, I was placed in the care of the state after my father committed suicide and because my mother suffered from mental illness.Within a year, I was on the streets with no home, education or job skills. All I had was my body. At 15, I met a young man who thought it would be a good idea for me to prostitute myself. As “fresh meat,” I was a commodity in high demand.For seven years, I was bought and sold. On the streets, that could be 10 times in a night. It’s hard to describe the full effect of the psychological coercion, and how deeply it eroded my confidence. By my late teens, I was using cocaine to dull the pain.I cringe when I hear the words “sex work.” Selling my body wasn’t a livelihood. There was no resemblance to ordinary employment in the ritual degradation of strangers’ using my body to satiate their urges. I was doubly exploited — by those who pimped me and those who bought me.I know there are some advocates who argue that women in prostitution sell sex as consenting adults. But those who do are a relatively privileged minority — primarily white, middle-class, Western women in escort agencies — not remotely representative of the global majority. Their right to sell doesn’t trump my right and others’ not to be sold in a trade that preys on women already marginalized by class and race.The effort to decriminalize the sex trade worldwide is not a progressive movement. Implementing this policy will simply calcify into law men’s entitlement to buy sex, while decriminalizing pimping will protect no one but the pimps.Gillian Abel, an associate professor and head of the Department of Population Health at the University of Otago in Christchurch, New Zealand, argues in this Room for Debate piece that prostitution should be legal:Sex work is an occupation that many women voluntarily choose. To deny that prostitution is work not only infringes on women’s right to choose their work, but also on that of men, transgender and gender-diverse individuals. And denying sex workers the right to do their work legally infringes on other rights, such as their access to legal aid and recourse.In 2003, New Zealand was the first country to decriminalize sex work for the workers, their clients and third parties (minders, pimps, landlords, or anyone else who may receive money from sex workers’ earnings). This move allowed sex workers to operate under the same legal and labor rights as any other occupational group, and makes them less vulnerable to exploitation.New Zealand sex workers are now able to govern their own work, collaborating with their peers or electing to use third-party management, such as a brothel operator. Sex workers can now request police assistance if they are exposed to violence, report crimes without fear of being held accountable for involvement in the illegal acts themselves, and seek support services.This has already begun to play out. A police officer went to jail in 2010 for coercing a sex worker into providing free sex by threatening her with traffic fines. In another case last year, a sex worker was awarded $21,000 after successfully bringing a sexual harassment lawsuit against the operator of the brothel where she worked. (The sex worker liked her work but objected to the manner in which the operator of the brothel was treating her.)Prior to decriminalization, it would have been impossible for a sex worker to legally challenge bullying and exploitative behavior.Students: Read both articles, then tell us …— Should prostitution be legal?— Is sex work an occupation that many women voluntarily choose? Does denying sex workers the right to do their work legally infringe on other rights, including their access to legal aid?— Does making prostitution legal make women less vulnerable to abuse by criminals? Does it give sex workers the same labor rights as other occupational groups? Would it make women safer? — Or, will making prostitution legal lead to higher rates of human trafficking without solving the issues of abuse and exploitation?— Ms. Moran recommends the “Nordic Model” (or the “Equality Model”) as a better way of protecting prostitutes than decriminalization. She explains:The concept is simple: Make selling sex legal but buying it illegal — so that women can get help without being arrested, harassed or worse, and the criminal law is used to deter the buyers, because they fuel the market.

10,Right to Health Care,Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?,2s10q9r,https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/7-topics-trump-should-address-the-state-the-union,7 Topics Trump Should Address in the State of the Union | The Heritage Foundation,"Frequently SearchedTop IssuesDomestic PolicyPolitical ThoughtInternationalGovernment SpendingEnergy & EnvironmentLegal and JudicialInfrastructure & TechnologyNational SecurityCultureHealth CarePoverty & WelfareEconomySenior Advisor and SpokespersonPresident Donald Trump will finally deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday night. Americans can certainly expect Trump to advocate border security, including a wall or fence—and he’ll no doubt tout the terrific success of the economy during his tenure.But there’s also plenty more the president should address in his speech, including these seven topics as prescribed by Heritage Foundation policy experts:In his State of the Union remarks, Trump should challenge Congress to work with his administration on lowering health care costs, improving choices, and protecting people with pre-existing conditions.  Get exclusive insider information from Heritage experts delivered straight to your inbox each week. Subscribe to The Agenda >>Last year, the Trump administration acted to provide administrative relief and offer new flexibility to the states. States found that they could lower costs without new federal spending and also ensure those with pre-existing conditions could get access to care.  These initial results are promising, but more needs to be done to get out from under many fundamentally flawed federal mandates and regulations. Original research by Heritage Foundation scholars shows that if states get even a little bit of freedom from federal mandates, they can bring costs down further while still protecting people with pre-existing conditions.   To really turn things around, Trump should call on Congress to work with his administration to build on this success by providing states the statutory flexibility, resources, and incentives they need to lower costs and increase choices for all Americans. The president’s 2018 budget outlined a plan to do just that and falls in line with a new proposal that has the support of nearly 100 state and national policy leaders.  Under the Health Care Choices Proposal, everyone who gets a subsidy to buy health care would have the option to use it to get private coverage of their choice—even those on Medicaid.  The proposal eliminates a perverse federal-subsidy structure in Obamacare that rewards insurance companies that raise premiums by giving them more federal money.  Instead, the plan would convert this failed spending scheme into a grant to states to achieve the goal of expanding choices and lowering costs while guaranteeing that everyone with pre-existing conditions is protected. An independent analysis of the plan by the Center for Health and Economy in research commissioned by The Heritage Foundation estimates that the proposal could lower premiums for individual coverage by up to 32 percent. This plan is far better than what some on the left want to do. A growing number of Democrats are rallying around proposals that outlaw private insurance and put everyone on a government-run plan.Research by The Heritage Foundation shows these kinds of ideas will only make matters worse and result in reduced access to care, long waiting lists, and higher tax burdens for working Americans. —Marie Fishpaw2. Increased Border SecurityImmigration is an emotionally and politically charged issue, but despite the emotion, good policy hasn’t changed. The United States still needs better enforcement and border security. The U.S. needs more and better border security, including a mix of barriers, technology, and agents, deployed where they are cost-effective and most needed. Perhaps more importantly, however, the president should make the case for better enforcement. When someone overstays a visa, when they show up at a port of entry and claim asylum, when they are apprehended by Border Patrol agents, or when they sneak across the border, the U.S. needs to have strong enforcement to make sure illegal immigrants are caught and removed. This means making the case for strong interior enforcement, improving Immigration and Customs Enforcement and our immigration courts, and closing loopholes that make it difficult to enforce the law. Of course, the U.S. also needs to engage with countries south of the border to slow the flow of illegal immigration from Latin America.Trump can, and should, make the case for these much-needed reforms in his State of the Union address. —David Inserra3. Cutting SpendingSixty-eight thousand dollars for every man, woman, and child. That’s what the $22 trillion national debt amounts to. The debt is growing at a rapid pace with annual deficits projected to exceed $1 trillion for the foreseeable future. Congress and the administration should seize the opportunity this year to pair any increase in the debt limit with significant fiscal restraints. Trump should make it crystal clear that the administration will not support an increase in the debt limit without commensurate budget reforms that reduce and control spending. Trump should also set the stage for Budget Control Act negotiations this year by demanding that any increase in the spending caps for discretionary spending must be paid for with spending reductions to duplicative, wasteful, and inappropriate federal spending. America cannot afford another deficit-busting budget deal.—Romina Boccia4. End the Trade War With ChinaConservatives want to hear that the trade war with China is coming to an end.Since July of last year, the White House has levied new taxes on Chinese imports into America. Beijing has reciprocated against U.S. exporters, leading to an escalation in trade tensions. With no progress being made yet, U.S. businesses are concerned about the future of U.S. trade policy toward China, as U.S. exporters are losing their market share. Trump should use the State of the Union address to commit to the principles of free trade and to enforcing the rule of law. He also should affirm that the White House is close to making a trade deal with China that will remove the tariffs. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is leading the talks with Beijing to reach a trade deal before March 1. Concerns over Chinese practices regarding joint venture requirements, limits on American companies to set their own licensing agreements, the transfer of technology to China, and cyber intrusions have led to tariffs on more than $250 billion worth of annual imports from China. While the talks may lead to a deal in which Beijing buys more U.S. energy and agricultural goods, there are still limitations on what the U.S. can achieve through its unilateral approach.Whether a deal is made or not, trade talks with China won’t end on March 1, but that doesn’t mean the tariffs on traded goods need to continue.The White House should affirm its commitment to the principles of free trade by removing the unnecessary tariffs on the goods Americans buy from China. In addition, the White House should commit to its trade agreements while enforcing the rule of law. More should be done to punish those individuals and companies found guilty of cyber intrusions and intellectual property theft. —Riley Walters5. Safeguarding the Integrity of Our ElectionsThe president needs to remind members of Congress that protecting the right to vote and safeguarding the integrity of our elections is fundamental to preserving and maintaining our great republic. We must ensure that all eligible Americans are able to vote and that their vote is counted, not stolen or diluted by fraud or administrative errors.While elected officials have a duty to guarantee the security and fairness of the election system, they must do so without restricting the ability of our citizens and candidates for public office to speak freely and otherwise to engage in the political process, including the ability to associate with other members of the public who share their beliefs.  The federal government, and particularly Congress, also has an obligation to recognize the authority of the states under the Constitution to administer elections and must avoid federalizing and nationalizing a process that is the prerogative of state and local governments.The president should assure that under his direction, the Justice Department will vigorously enforce federal laws that protect the right of Americans to register and to vote, require states to maintain the accuracy of voter registration rolls, and guarantee the right of members of our military and their families stationed abroad to vote.   The Justice Department will also robustly prosecute election crimes and any attempts to subvert the voting process through fraud and ensure that noncitizens and others not entitled to vote do not manipulate the election system.—Hans von Spakovsky 6. Help Americans Escape PovertyThe president should challenge Congress to work with him on reforms to help Americans escape poverty by addressing barriers to work and stable marriages. The welfare system today is vast: According to research by The Heritage Foundation, there are 89 federal means-tested welfare programs in the current welfare system, with a total annual cost of more than $1.1 trillion.  The poor will benefit from a welfare system that encourages work and marriage. The current welfare system fails dramatically in both respects. Work is critical to promoting human dignity and establishing fairness between the taxpayer providing assistance and the person receiving it. Yet, of the 89 federal means-tested welfare programs, only three require work in order to get benefits.  Marriage is the No. 1 factor in promoting upward social mobility among children, but our welfare system heavily penalizes families who marry.   According to research by The Heritage Foundation, a mother and father with two children making $20,000 each will lose $6,302 in welfare benefits per year if they marry—a 15 percent drop in their total family income. Polls show that Americans support these fixes. More than 90 percent of Americans agree that able-bodied adults who receive cash, food, housing, and medical assistance should be required to work or prepare for work as a condition of receiving those government benefits. More than 80 percent of Americans agree that the welfare system should not penalize parents when they get married.    Last year, Trump took steps to advance those important goals, and Congress should join him. A good place to start would be reforming the earned income tax credit and additional child tax credit, the nation’s second-largest means-tested cash welfare program.  As research by The Heritage Foundation shows, the current program is flawed, does not promote work sufficiently, and severely punishes marriage. Congress should reform the credits to eliminate fraud, strongly promote work, and strengthen marriage. —Marie Fishpaw7. Improve InfrastructureRather than calling for a bill stuffed with pork projects and federal mandates, Trump should make the case to Congress and the nation for improving infrastructure by getting the federal government out of the way. The president’s deregulatory agenda is one of the driving forces behind today’s strong economy, and there is still a huge amount of potential infrastructure investment that can be generated with further regulatory reforms, many of which require new legislation.Unfortunately, the swamp still insists on having Washington micromanage what gets built and where. With the national debt perilously close to $22 trillion, we cannot afford to put the cost of an infrastructure package on the federal credit card. Those who call for hiking the gas tax or instituting new mileage-based taxes would place the burden squarely on lower- and middle-class families. Instead, Trump and Congress should draw from the dozens of ideas presented in the 2019 President’s Budget and The Heritage “Blueprint for Balance” to find wasteful spending that can be cut to offset the cost of any new infrastructure spending. In addition, that spending should be focused on truly national infrastructure needs, such as the interstate highway system, not on local roads or transit. —David DitchThis piece originally appeared in The Daily SignalEach week, The Heritage Foundation publishes a limited-release newsletter with all of the latest news and updates on the critical policy issues being discussed on the Hill.

Americans can certainly expect Trump to advocate border security, including a wall or fence—and he’ll no doubt tout the terrific success of the economy during his tenure.But there’s also plenty more the president should address in his speech, including these seven topics as prescribed by Heritage Foundation policy experts:In his State of the Union remarks, Trump should challenge Congress to work with his administration on lowering health care costs, improving choices, and protecting people with pre-existing conditions.  Get exclusive insider information from Heritage experts delivered straight to your inbox each week. Subscribe to The Agenda >>Last year, the Trump administration acted to provide administrative relief and offer new flexibility to the states. States found that they could lower costs without new federal spending and also ensure those with pre-existing conditions could get access to care.  These initial results are promising, but more needs to be done to get out from under many fundamentally flawed federal mandates and regulations. Original research by Heritage Foundation scholars shows that if states get even a little bit of freedom from federal mandates, they can bring costs down further while still protecting people with pre-existing conditions.   To really turn things around, Trump should call on Congress to work with his administration to build on this success by providing states the statutory flexibility, resources, and incentives they need to lower costs and increase choices for all Americans. The president’s 2018 budget outlined a plan to do just that and falls in line with a new proposal that has the support of nearly 100 state and national policy leaders.  Under the Health Care Choices Proposal, everyone who gets a subsidy to buy health care would have the option to use it to get private coverage of their choice—even those on Medicaid.  The proposal eliminates a perverse federal-subsidy structure in Obamacare that rewards insurance companies that raise premiums by giving them more federal money.  Instead, the plan would convert this failed spending scheme into a grant to states to achieve the goal of expanding choices and lowering costs while guaranteeing that everyone with pre-existing conditions is protected. An independent analysis of the plan by the Center for Health and Economy in research commissioned by The Heritage Foundation estimates that the proposal could lower premiums for individual coverage by up to 32 percent. This plan is far better than what some on the left want to do. A growing number of Democrats are rallying around proposals that outlaw private insurance and put everyone on a government-run plan.Research by The Heritage Foundation shows these kinds of ideas will only make matters worse and result in reduced access to care, long waiting lists, and higher tax burdens for working Americans. —Marie Fishpaw2. Increased Border SecurityImmigration is an emotionally and politically charged issue, but despite the emotion, good policy hasn’t changed. The United States still needs better enforcement and border security. The U.S. needs more and better border security, including a mix of barriers, technology, and agents, deployed where they are cost-effective and most needed. Perhaps more importantly, however, the president should make the case for better enforcement. When someone overstays a visa, when they show up at a port of entry and claim asylum, when they are apprehended by Border Patrol agents, or when they sneak across the border, the U.S. needs to have strong enforcement to make sure illegal immigrants are caught and removed. This means making the case for strong interior enforcement, improving Immigration and Customs Enforcement and our immigration courts, and closing loopholes that make it difficult to enforce the law.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.When the City of Charlotte hosts the NBA All-Star game on Sunday, two years will have passed from when city was supposed to be the host. The delay reflects NBA commissioner Adam Silver adeptly utilizing the league’s financial heft and social influence to push for change to a controversial law.The All-Star Game and the Bathroom BillOn June 23, 2015, Silver was joined by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan and other distinguished persons from the Tar Heel state at a press conference in Charlotte’s Time Warner Cable Arena. It was there when Silver revealed that the Charlotte would host the All-Star game in February 2017.""As a thriving city with a proud basketball tradition and a deep passion for the game,” Silver reflected. “The city of Charlotte is a terrific All-Star destination.”Nine months later, this plan would go awry.On March 23, 2016 the North Carolina General Assembly voted to approve the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, better known as House Bill 2 (HB2) or simply “the Bathroom Bill.” McCrory, who had previously stood next to Silver, signed the bill into law that evening. In doing so, McCrory ensured that North Carolina would become the first and only state to make it illegal for a person to use a bathroom different from the gender listed on that person’s birth certificate.HB2 was a legislative response to a municipal ordinance that the City of Charlotte had recently passed. This municipal ordinance, which never went into effect due to preemption by HB2, amended Charlotte’s code so that sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity would be legally protected characteristics. Such protection would have governed businesses, public areas and—of particular controversy at the time—bathrooms. The ordinance warranted that transgender persons could use the bathroom associated with the gender with which they identified.Charlotte’s ordinance faced intense criticism from some. Famed evangelist Billy Graham denounced it as “wicked” and “filthy.” Critics also expressed fear that transgender persons using bathrooms different from the ones on their birth certificate could pose safety concerns. One Charlotte resident worried, “I’m not scared of transgenders, but sexual predators will see this as a chance for fresh victims.”Others viewed Charlotte’s ordinance as promoting human dignity and countering discrimination. Safety fears related to transgender persons’ access to bathrooms also lacked empirical support. Indeed, critics of Charlotte’s ordinance couldn’t point to a record of transgender-related crimes in bathrooms because there was no such record. To that point, a recent study led by Amira Hasenbush of UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute found no statistically-significant evidence that transgender people who use the gender with which they identified have led to safety or privacy violations. The study also concluded that passage of bathroom laws is “not related to the number or frequency of criminal incidents in these spaces.”Opponents of the Charlotte’s ordinance won the day in the North Carolina assembly. State legislators proposed HB2 and then advanced it to passage. Among its provisions, HB2 required public schools and government facilities with single-sex bathrooms to only allow usage by persons of the appropriate “biological sex.” HB2 defined “biological sex” as “the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.” HB2 also preempted any municipal and local ordinances that would conflict with HB2.As a result, HB2 made it illegal for transgender persons who identified with the sex not stated on their birth certificate to use many types of bathrooms. It also prevented Charlotte and other municipalities from implementing ordinances that would allow transgender persons to use the bathroom assigned to the gender with which they identified.Legal commentators noted assorted inconsistencies between HB2 and Title IX, a federal law that, among other things, outlaws gender discrimination in schools. Title IX has been interpreted to prohibit discrimination against transgender students in public schools. Nonetheless, North Carolina put its law into effect.MCANN: What's Next as Duke Investigates Alleged 1999 Rape?The NBA and other businesses respond to HB2 through the power of cancellationHB2 may have only governed North Carolina, but it spurred a national controversy. Various out-of-state businesses and performers de-committed from earlier pledges to bring jobs and events to North Carolina. PayPal, for instance, rescinded its plan to open a center in Charlotte that would have provided more than 400 jobs. At the time, CEO Dan Shulman stressed that HB2 “perpetuates discrimination” and “violates the values and principles” of his company. Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro. At the time, the legendary singer lamented that “some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry—which is happening as I write—is one of them.”The loss of economic activity for North Carolina was real and measurable. In March 2017, the Associated Press reported that the state stood to lose $3.8 billion in forgone business opportunities due to HB2.Among the more notable lost revenue opportunities were those found in the sports industry. Economic activity generated through the NBA was at the top of the list.Three days after McCrory signed HB2 into law, the NBA issued a stern rebuke of the law as incompatible with its basic values. The league stressed that HB2 betrayed its commitment to “creating an inclusive environment for all who attend our games and events.” The NBA also voiced “deep concern” that “this discriminatory law runs counter to our guiding principles of equality and mutual respect.” Of perhaps greatest alarm to both North Carolina lawmakers and Charlotte officials, the league admonished that it might move the All-Star game if the state failed to repeal HB2.After repeated warnings went unheeded, the NBA announced in July 2016 that it was pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. It would instead be played in New Orleans’s Smoothie King Center. The NBA explained that league officials would only agree to host an All-Star game where “all patrons—including members of the LGBT community—feel welcome” and that they “do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2.”The NBA’s decision was expected to cost Charlotte $100 million in anticipated revenue. McCrory, for his part, was decidedly unpleased with both the NBA and Silver. He blamed “the sports and entertainment elite” as well as “the liberal media”, “the left-wing special interest groups” and “the selective corporate elite.” McCrory further argued that the NBA’s decision reflected a “misrepresentation” of laws that “maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present.”The NCAA and ACC follow the NBA’s lead on HB2The NBA’s willingness to immediately and forcefully challenge North Carolina over a controversial law was noticed by other leagues and sports organizations. It likely galvanized them to act.In late April, the NCAA modified its application procedure for venues that sought to host NCAA championship games. Most notably, venues had to answer a questionnaire about the bathroom policies for both the venue and for the municipality and state in which the venue is located. The NCAA’s response to HB2 was consistent with the organization’s previous statements in opposition to state laws that it believed undermined an “inclusive environment.” For instance, in 2015, NCAA president Mark Emmert rebuked Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This law allows individuals and businesses to invoke religious freedom as a reason to not sell goods or provide services to customers (the extent to which Indiana’s law supplements existing federal law on religious freedom is a matter of legal debate). Emmert expressed “concern about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.”Five months after issuing its bathroom questionnaire, the NCAA pulled championship games—including 2017 men’s basketball tournament—that were set to be played in North Carolina. The NCAA, which took action two months after the NBA pulled the All-Star game, identified several reasons for its decision. One key rationale was the NCAA’s objection to North Carolina invalidating Charlotte’s ordinance that had been designed to prohibit discrimination against transgender persons. The NCAA also made clear that its “championships and events must promote an inclusive atmosphere for all college athletes, coaches, administrators and fans.” One estimate indicates North Carolina stood to lose approximately $18 million in projected revenue from the loss of those NCAA games.Even more financially consequential to the North Carolina was the Atlantic Coast Conference’s decision to cancel its major games in the state. After watching the NBC and NCAA take action, the ACC pulled 12 championship games from North Carolina. The conference highlighted HB2’s incompatibility with the ACC’s commitment to inclusion and non-discrimination.The ACC gained support from prominent coaches of colleges in North Carolina. For instance, UNC coach Roy Williams described HB2 as both “stupid” and “ridiculous.” The ACC’s decision would prove costly to North Carolina: the state was projected to lose $38 million due to the loss of ACC championship games.MCANN: Will Pelicans Be in Danger of Violating Anti-Tanking Rule?Silver’s track record of action and sponsorship considerationsSilver’s willingness to carry through on a threat to pull the All-Star game should have been known to North Carolina’s business and political leaders. To the extent they believed he was bluffing, they clearly hadn’t done their homework.Under Silver’s leadership, the NBA has shown little tolerance for bigotry. It has also displayed a willingness to take extraordinary steps.Silver had only been commissioner for two months when Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s racist comments were published in an April 2014 TMZ story. After four days of fact-finding and analysis, Silver responded decisively. The commissioner permanently banned Sterling from the NBA—an unprecedented penalty for an owner and one that was sure to bring about litigation. Silver also urged owners of the other 29 franchises to vote Sterling out. Three months later, Silver, with Shelly Sterling’s involvement, successfully engineered Sterling’s removal as owner of the Clippers. Also, for all practice purposes, Silver—an attorney by trade—thwarted and outmaneuvered Donald Sterling’s multiple legal attempts to stop the expulsion.Silver also ensured that an investigation into sexual harassment and related workplace misconduct with the Dallas Mavericks be thorough and extensive. The investigation, launched after publication of an SI investigative report by Jon Wertheim and Jessica Luther in February 2018, led to Mavericks owner Mark Cuban donating $10 million (four times the maximum amount Silver could have fined Cuban under the NBA’s constitution) to organizations that deter and prevent mistreatment of women.The league has also pursued policies that are designed to curb discrimination. For instance, the NBA has collaborated with LeanIn.org to promote leadership opportunities for women with NBA teams. Further, the NBA’s statement on diversity and inclusion emphasize that the league provides an “inclusive workplace.”Silver has also earned goodwill with players and sponsors through his deft handling of social issues. Sterling’s remarks led LeBron James, Stephen Curry and NBA stars to threaten to boycott playoff games unless Sterling was ousted. Silver listened to their call and took action accordingly.Also, while the NFL has badly struggled to handle the social and legal implications of players who kneel during the playing of the national anthem, the NBA hasn’t encountered those issues under Silver’s watch. This is in spite of the fact that NBA requires players to stand during the playing of the national anthem. All of the league’s players, regardless of their race, national origin or political views, have adhered to the anthem rule during Silver’s tenure (one player, Denver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, refused to stand for the anthem in 1996, when David Stern was commissioner). One likely reason for players’ uniform adherence is that Silver has encouraged players to be active socially and politically while not playing. He has also described players locking arms during the anthem as “respectful unity.”Silver has been able to thread a needle between the interests of players, fans, broadcast partners and sponsors. In ousting Sterling, Silver responded to both players threatening to boycott and major Clippers’ sponsors, including Virgin America and Mercedes-Benz, threatening to end their commercial association. In relocating the All-Star game out of Charlotte, Silver took account of viewpoints from numerous constituencies, including broadcast companies and many fans.North Carolina changes its law and the NBA All-Star game returnsAs referenced above, the NBA was only one of many entities that took business away from North Carolina in response to HB2. However, among sports organizations, the NBA was the first to such take such a major step as removal of a nationally-televised game.The collective pressure worked, at least in part. On March 30, 2017, a new governor, Roy Cooper, signed House Bill 142 (HB142) into law. HB142 repealed HB2 and eliminated the controversial bathroom language. As a result, North Carolina law no longer requires single-sex bathrooms to only permit usage by persons of the appropriate “biological sex.”In other respects, HB142 fell short of what critics of the bathroom bill had demanded. Most importantly, HB142 forbids Charlotte and other municipalities and towns from passing anti-discrimination ordinances related to public accommodations— including bathrooms—until 2020. HB142 also makes clear that questions related to single-sex bathrooms are to be determined by the state, and not by cities and towns. Therefore, Charlotte’s 2016 ordinance, as discussed above, remains unenforceable. Likewise, while North Carolina’s current legal regime for bathrooms doesn’t expressly discriminate on the basis of sexual identity, it neither offers protection nor allows cities and towns to offer safeguards. The state of bathroom access law in North Carolina, then, is like it was before Charlotte’s ordinance and HB2.On May 24, 2017, Silver announced that the All-Star game would return to Charlotte in 2019. Silver offered a lukewarm assessment of HB142 and acknowledged its short-comings. However, he also stressed that HB142 “eliminates the most egregious aspects” of HB2 and that the NBA would collaborate with Hornets’ leadership to apply “a set of equality principles to ensure that every All-Star event will proceed with open access and anti-discrimination policies.”As states grapple with controversial social topics in the years ahead, the NBA and other leagues will face choices on whether to exert their influence and leverage. The NBA’s response to “the Bathroom Bill” will serve as an instructive illustration of when a league decides to use its power.Michael McCann is SI’s legal analyst.

The delay reflects NBA commissioner Adam Silver adeptly utilizing the league’s financial heft and social influence to push for change to a controversial law.The All-Star Game and the Bathroom BillOn June 23, 2015, Silver was joined by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan and other distinguished persons from the Tar Heel state at a press conference in Charlotte’s Time Warner Cable Arena. It was there when Silver revealed that the Charlotte would host the All-Star game in February 2017.""As a thriving city with a proud basketball tradition and a deep passion for the game,” Silver reflected. “The city of Charlotte is a terrific All-Star destination.”Nine months later, this plan would go awry.On March 23, 2016 the North Carolina General Assembly voted to approve the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, better known as House Bill 2 (HB2) or simply “the Bathroom Bill.” McCrory, who had previously stood next to Silver, signed the bill into law that evening. In doing so, McCrory ensured that North Carolina would become the first and only state to make it illegal for a person to use a bathroom different from the gender listed on that person’s birth certificate.HB2 was a legislative response to a municipal ordinance that the City of Charlotte had recently passed. This municipal ordinance, which never went into effect due to preemption by HB2, amended Charlotte’s code so that sexual orientation, gender expression and gender identity would be legally protected characteristics. Such protection would have governed businesses, public areas and—of particular controversy at the time—bathrooms. The ordinance warranted that transgender persons could use the bathroom associated with the gender with which they identified.Charlotte’s ordinance faced intense criticism from some. Famed evangelist Billy Graham denounced it as “wicked” and “filthy.” Critics also expressed fear that transgender persons using bathrooms different from the ones on their birth certificate could pose safety concerns. One Charlotte resident worried, “I’m not scared of transgenders, but sexual predators will see this as a chance for fresh victims.”Others viewed Charlotte’s ordinance as promoting human dignity and countering discrimination. Safety fears related to transgender persons’ access to bathrooms also lacked empirical support. Indeed, critics of Charlotte’s ordinance couldn’t point to a record of transgender-related crimes in bathrooms because there was no such record. To that point, a recent study led by Amira Hasenbush of UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute found no statistically-significant evidence that transgender people who use the gender with which they identified have led to safety or privacy violations. The study also concluded that passage of bathroom laws is “not related to the number or frequency of criminal incidents in these spaces.”Opponents of the Charlotte’s ordinance won the day in the North Carolina assembly. State legislators proposed HB2 and then advanced it to passage. Among its provisions, HB2 required public schools and government facilities with single-sex bathrooms to only allow usage by persons of the appropriate “biological sex.” HB2 defined “biological sex” as “the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate.” HB2 also preempted any municipal and local ordinances that would conflict with HB2.As a result, HB2 made it illegal for transgender persons who identified with the sex not stated on their birth certificate to use many types of bathrooms. It also prevented Charlotte and other municipalities from implementing ordinances that would allow transgender persons to use the bathroom assigned to the gender with which they identified.Legal commentators noted assorted inconsistencies between HB2 and Title IX, a federal law that, among other things, outlaws gender discrimination in schools. Title IX has been interpreted to prohibit discrimination against transgender students in public schools. Nonetheless, North Carolina put its law into effect.MCANN: What's Next as Duke Investigates Alleged 1999 Rape?The NBA and other businesses respond to HB2 through the power of cancellationHB2 may have only governed North Carolina, but it spurred a national controversy. Various out-of-state businesses and performers de-committed from earlier pledges to bring jobs and events to North Carolina. PayPal, for instance, rescinded its plan to open a center in Charlotte that would have provided more than 400 jobs. At the time, CEO Dan Shulman stressed that HB2 “perpetuates discrimination” and “violates the values and principles” of his company. Meanwhile, Bruce Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro. At the time, the legendary singer lamented that “some things are more important than a rock show and this fight against prejudice and bigotry—which is happening as I write—is one of them.”The loss of economic activity for North Carolina was real and measurable. In March 2017, the Associated Press reported that the state stood to lose $3.8 billion in forgone business opportunities due to HB2.Among the more notable lost revenue opportunities were those found in the sports industry. Economic activity generated through the NBA was at the top of the list.Three days after McCrory signed HB2 into law, the NBA issued a stern rebuke of the law as incompatible with its basic values. The league stressed that HB2 betrayed its commitment to “creating an inclusive environment for all who attend our games and events.” The NBA also voiced “deep concern” that “this discriminatory law runs counter to our guiding principles of equality and mutual respect.” Of perhaps greatest alarm to both North Carolina lawmakers and Charlotte officials, the league admonished that it might move the All-Star game if the state failed to repeal HB2.After repeated warnings went unheeded, the NBA announced in July 2016 that it was pulling the All-Star game from Charlotte. It would instead be played in New Orleans’s Smoothie King Center. The NBA explained that league officials would only agree to host an All-Star game where “all patrons—including members of the LGBT community—feel welcome” and that they “do not believe we can successfully host our All-Star festivities in Charlotte in the climate created by HB2.”The NBA’s decision was expected to cost Charlotte $100 million in anticipated revenue. McCrory, for his part, was decidedly unpleased with both the NBA and Silver. He blamed “the sports and entertainment elite” as well as “the liberal media”, “the left-wing special interest groups” and “the selective corporate elite.” McCrory further argued that the NBA’s decision reflected a “misrepresentation” of laws that “maligned the people of North Carolina simply because most people believe boys and girls should be able to use school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers without the opposite sex present.”The NCAA and ACC follow the NBA’s lead on HB2The NBA’s willingness to immediately and forcefully challenge North Carolina over a controversial law was noticed by other leagues and sports organizations. It likely galvanized them to act.In late April, the NCAA modified its application procedure for venues that sought to host NCAA championship games. Most notably, venues had to answer a questionnaire about the bathroom policies for both the venue and for the municipality and state in which the venue is located. The NCAA’s response to HB2 was consistent with the organization’s previous statements in opposition to state laws that it believed undermined an “inclusive environment.” For instance, in 2015, NCAA president Mark Emmert rebuked Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This law allows individuals and businesses to invoke religious freedom as a reason to not sell goods or provide services to customers (the extent to which Indiana’s law supplements existing federal law on religious freedom is a matter of legal debate). Emmert expressed “concern about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.”Five months after issuing its bathroom questionnaire, the NCAA pulled championship games—including 2017 men’s basketball tournament—that were set to be played in North Carolina. The NCAA, which took action two months after the NBA pulled the All-Star game, identified several reasons for its decision. One key rationale was the NCAA’s objection to North Carolina invalidating Charlotte’s ordinance that had been designed to prohibit discrimination against transgender persons. The NCAA also made clear that its “championships and events must promote an inclusive atmosphere for all college athletes, coaches, administrators and fans.” One estimate indicates North Carolina stood to lose approximately $18 million in projected revenue from the loss of those NCAA games.Even more financially consequential to the North Carolina was the Atlantic Coast Conference’s decision to cancel its major games in the state. After watching the NBC and NCAA take action, the ACC pulled 12 championship games from North Carolina. The conference highlighted HB2’s incompatibility with the ACC’s commitment to inclusion and non-discrimination.The ACC gained support from prominent coaches of colleges in North Carolina. For instance, UNC coach Roy Williams described HB2 as both “stupid” and “ridiculous.” The ACC’s decision would prove costly to North Carolina: the state was projected to lose $38 million due to the loss of ACC championship games.MCANN: Will Pelicans Be in Danger of Violating Anti-Tanking Rule?Silver’s track record of action and sponsorship considerationsSilver’s willingness to carry through on a threat to pull the All-Star game should have been known to North Carolina’s business and political leaders. To the extent they believed he was bluffing, they clearly hadn’t done their homework.Under Silver’s leadership, the NBA has shown little tolerance for bigotry. It has also displayed a willingness to take extraordinary steps.Silver had only been commissioner for two months when Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s racist comments were published in an April 2014 TMZ story. After four days of fact-finding and analysis, Silver responded decisively. The commissioner permanently banned Sterling from the NBA—an unprecedented penalty for an owner and one that was sure to bring about litigation. Silver also urged owners of the other 29 franchises to vote Sterling out. Three months later, Silver, with Shelly Sterling’s involvement, successfully engineered Sterling’s removal as owner of the Clippers. Also, for all practice purposes, Silver—an attorney by trade—thwarted and outmaneuvered Donald Sterling’s multiple legal attempts to stop the expulsion.Silver also ensured that an investigation into sexual harassment and related workplace misconduct with the Dallas Mavericks be thorough and extensive. The investigation, launched after publication of an SI investigative report by Jon Wertheim and Jessica Luther in February 2018, led to Mavericks owner Mark Cuban donating $10 million (four times the maximum amount Silver could have fined Cuban under the NBA’s constitution) to organizations that deter and prevent mistreatment of women.The league has also pursued policies that are designed to curb discrimination. For instance, the NBA has collaborated with LeanIn.org to promote leadership opportunities for women with NBA teams. Further, the NBA’s statement on diversity and inclusion emphasize that the league provides an “inclusive workplace.”Silver has also earned goodwill with players and sponsors through his deft handling of social issues. Sterling’s remarks led LeBron James, Stephen Curry and NBA stars to threaten to boycott playoff games unless Sterling was ousted. Silver listened to their call and took action accordingly.Also, while the NFL has badly struggled to handle the social and legal implications of players who kneel during the playing of the national anthem, the NBA hasn’t encountered those issues under Silver’s watch. This is in spite of the fact that NBA requires players to stand during the playing of the national anthem. All of the league’s players, regardless of their race, national origin or political views, have adhered to the anthem rule during Silver’s tenure (one player, Denver Nuggets guard Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, refused to stand for the anthem in 1996, when David Stern was commissioner). One likely reason for players’ uniform adherence is that Silver has encouraged players to be active socially and politically while not playing. He has also described players locking arms during the anthem as “respectful unity.”Silver has been able to thread a needle between the interests of players, fans, broadcast partners and sponsors. In ousting Sterling, Silver responded to both players threatening to boycott and major Clippers’ sponsors, including Virgin America and Mercedes-Benz, threatening to end their commercial association. In relocating the All-Star game out of Charlotte, Silver took account of viewpoints from numerous constituencies, including broadcast companies and many fans.North Carolina changes its law and the NBA All-Star game returnsAs referenced above, the NBA was only one of many entities that took business away from North Carolina in response to HB2. However, among sports organizations, the NBA was the first to such take such a major step as removal of a nationally-televised game.The collective pressure worked, at least in part. On March 30, 2017, a new governor, Roy Cooper, signed House Bill 142 (HB142) into law. HB142 repealed HB2 and eliminated the controversial bathroom language. As a result, North Carolina law no longer requires single-sex bathrooms to only permit usage by persons of the appropriate “biological sex.”In other respects, HB142 fell short of what critics of the bathroom bill had demanded. Most importantly, HB142 forbids Charlotte and other municipalities and towns from passing anti-discrimination ordinances related to public accommodations— including bathrooms—until 2020. HB142 also makes clear that questions related to single-sex bathrooms are to be determined by the state, and not by cities and towns. Therefore, Charlotte’s 2016 ordinance, as discussed above, remains unenforceable. Likewise, while North Carolina’s current legal regime for bathrooms doesn’t expressly discriminate on the basis of sexual identity, it neither offers protection nor allows cities and towns to offer safeguards. The state of bathroom access law in North Carolina, then, is like it was before Charlotte’s ordinance and HB2.On May 24, 2017, Silver announced that the All-Star game would return to Charlotte in 2019. Silver offered a lukewarm assessment of HB142 and acknowledged its short-comings. However, he also stressed that HB142 “eliminates the most egregious aspects” of HB2 and that the NBA would collaborate with Hornets’ leadership to apply “a set of equality principles to ensure that every All-Star event will proceed with open access and anti-discrimination policies.”As states grapple with controversial social topics in the years ahead, the NBA and other leagues will face choices on whether to exert their influence and leverage. The NBA’s response to “the Bathroom Bill” will serve as an instructive illustration of when a league decides to use its power.Michael McCann is SI’s legal analyst.

Restoring the question about citizenship on the 2020 Census is entirely reasonable. Our government should be able to answer the question, “How many American citizens live in our country?” We don’t have a national database of American citizens, with good reason. But it is important to know how many citizens and non-citizens are here, and the Census is the obvious way to find out. Until 1950, the decennial Census asked everyone about their citizenship. From 1970 to 2000, the question was asked of every respondent who completed the “long form” version of the census — about one in six households in the nation. It was only in 2010 that this long form was dropped entirely, and the citizenship question with it. Knowing generally how many citizens and non-citizens we have is important for us to be able to appropriately allocate resources for naturalization services and other programs aimed at helping immigrants become contributing members of our society. It will also help lawmakers and officials at all levels better understand the makeup of our communities. Equally important, collecting the information will help ensure the integrity of our democracy by helping local election officials properly and fairly administer elections and prevent voter fraud. Knowing how many votes should be cast in local precincts will help get-out-the-vote efforts and detect attempts to rig elections. We should all be in favor of full participation in fair elections and this is one way to ensure that. Without evidence, activists warn that restoring the citizenship question would reduce Census response rates. This concern can be addressed through robust community outreach explaining that law enforcement agencies have no access to personal Census data, and that an accurate Census makes it easier for our government to meet community needs. Sadly, those who disagree with President Donald Trump’s policies have so politicized the issue that they are stoking fear that wasn’t there before, thus undermining the effectiveness of those outreach efforts. They seem willing to blow up the Census to make a political point. This is wrong. The citizenship question is not a threat to our democracy, but stifling the collection of important information is. NO Tackey Chan State representative, Quincy Democrat The US Constitution mandates that every 10 years, the federal government conduct a census to count all the people in the United States. This means everyone can participate, regardless of gender, race, creed, religion, age, wealth, sexual orientation, or citizenship status. Over the centuries, the Census has become a reflection of the people of our nation and a vital tool for government to serve our communities. It is completely confidential — the release of personal Census information to any government agency is against the law. The Census has a direct impact on all our lives. It determines how many members of Congress each state has. It is used in allocating federal resources to cities and towns. It provides valuable data that helps shape public policy. Census questions should be used for these important functions.

Would it be used in awarding funding? Would it affect immigration laws? Would it create new policies segregating citizens and non-citizens? It is critical to know the real purpose of this change.More disturbingly, the citizenship question creates a new divide in our nation by establishing the inference that all non-citizens are here illegally. Millions of legal non-citizens live, work, and study in the United States. These individuals rely on public transportation, access city and town services, and become vibrant participants in their neighborhoods. Adding a citizenship question reaffirms a misconception that only citizens are active members of their communities. By discouraging non-citizens from completing the Census, it could also lead to an undercounting of the population in immigrant-rich cities like Quincy, in turn reducing the federal dollars they receive for all residents.Trust in government is close to historic lows. Congress and the President should not build walls to further challenge our participation as we seek to accurately represent our nation.

The research, conducted by the University of Oxford, said that as it stands up to six in ten British teenagers play violent video games. Scroll down for video Gory games such as Grand Theft Auto, pictured here, do not make young people more aggressive, according to the research. Up to six in ten British teenagers play violent video gamesThe study of 1,000 British 14 and 15-year-olds found that teens were no more likely to become antisocial or aggressive after a session playing explicitly violent games. The researchers used a technique called multiple regression analysis, using mathematical equations which provide a catalyst for influencing behaviour.  The study also differs from others as it takes the participants' parents into account, who were interviewed on their child's behaviour afterwards.  Teenagers completed questions on their personality and gaming over the past month, while carers filled in a survey on their child's recent aggressive behaviours. The researchers also found almost one in two of the girls - and two in three of the boys - play them. Lead author Professor Andrew Przybylski, an experimental psychologist at the University of Oxford, said: 'The idea violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn't tested very well over time.'Despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern.'The study published in Royal Society Open Science is the first of its kind. The teenagers provided reports of their recent gaming experiences, with the violent content coded using official EU and US ratings.Parents also provided evaluations of their adolescents' aggressive behaviours in the past month. Professor Przybylski said: 'Analyses tested the hypothesis recent violent game play is related to carer assessments of aggressive behaviour.'Results did not support this prediction. There was no evidence for a critical tipping point relating violent game engagement to aggressive behaviour.'Professor Przybylski said: 'Sensitivity and exploratory analyses indicated these null effects extended across multiple operationalisations of violent game engagement and when the focus was on another behavioural outcome, namely, prosocial behaviour.' The researchers used a technique called multiple regression analysis, mathematical equations that account for factors influencing behaviour.Professor Przybylski said: 'Sensitivity and exploratory analyses indicated these null effects extended across multiple operationalisations of violent game engagement and when the focus was on another behavioural outcome, namely, prosocial behaviour.'Some doctors claim there's too much focus on the negative affects of violent gaming, and in some cases, say games can actually help children combat behavioural problems.Call of Duty (pictured) is a wildly popular gaming franchise that is played by people of all ages. A study of 1,000 British 14 and 15 year olds found they were no more likely to become antisocial after a session playing explicitly violent games It's a topic that has been widely debated among the scientific community as parents and carers grow concerned about what effects technology has on children. Games like Assassin's Creed (pictured) sell millions of copies to children around the world The study is one of the most definitive to date, using a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games.Unlike previous research on the issue, which relied heavily on self-reported data from teenagers, it used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behaviour in their children.Additionally, the content of the video games was classified using the official Pan European Game Information (EU) and Entertainment Software Rating Board (US) rating system, rather than only player's perceptions of the amount of violence in the game.There are psychologists who argue both for and against them. One theory is that violent games affect those who are mentally vulnerable and suffer from things like depression and mood swings.Professor Przybylski said: 'Nearly all young people in the developed world now play video games, and this popularity has driven concerns about the possible negative effects of this recreational activity.Parents and legislators have long worried about the impact violent games have on  teenagers. The release of the latest Red Dead Redemption (pictured) made headlines around the world In a recent study, researchers looked at the three games participants played most, and noted if they were of a violent nature (such as shooting game Call of Duty) or non-violent (such as Fifa).They tracked the brainwaves of participants using electroencephalography (EEG).At the same time they completed a 'stop-signal task' which contained male and female faces looking either happy or scared.The study found gaming was linked to lower empathy and emotional callousness.Researchers believe this is because it inhibits people's ability to process emotional facial expression and control their responses as a result. 'Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely as a function of demographics and personal experiences with games.'Some researchers conclude gaming has social and cognitive benefits, whereas others argue the medium contributes to mass-shootings, and for consistent and strong effects on aggressive behaviour, more broadly.The American Psychological Association has warned youngsters' time spent playing video games should be limited.Yet the Australian and Swedish governments have concluded there is no actionable evidence that aggressive behaviour results from youth gaming.Professor Przybylski said: 'The question of whether adolescent engagement with violent video games drives aggressive behaviour in young people is a critically important one.'Indeed, our data indicated these games were regularly played by almost half of female and two-thirds of male teens in the UK.'Given this popularity, one might argue that a small effect linking violent gaming to aggressive behaviour would have consequences for society as a whole.' Co author Dr Netta Weinstein, of Cardiff University, said: 'Our findings suggest researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games.'An important step taken in the study included the researchers publicly registering their hypothesis, methods and analysis technique prior to the start.Professor Przybylski said: 'Part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results.'A cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. The registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.'While no link was found between playing video games and aggressive behaviour in teenagers, the researchers emphasise that this does not mean that some mechanics and situations in gaming do not provoke angry feelings or reactions in players. 'Anecdotally, you do see things such as trash-talking, competitiveness and trolling in gaming communities that could qualify as antisocial behaviour. This would be an interesting avenue for further research,' he added.",1,4,Against,Against,Against,0,Against,"['Against', 'Against', 'Against']","Do Violent Video Games Contribute to Youth Violence?

Games like Assassin's Creed (pictured) sell millions of copies to children around the world The study is one of the most definitive to date, using a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games.Unlike previous research on the issue, which relied heavily on self-reported data from teenagers, it used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behaviour in their children.Additionally, the content of the video games was classified using the official Pan European Game Information (EU) and Entertainment Software Rating Board (US) rating system, rather than only player's perceptions of the amount of violence in the game.There are psychologists who argue both for and against them. One theory is that violent games affect those who are mentally vulnerable and suffer from things like depression and mood swings.Professor Przybylski said: 'Nearly all young people in the developed world now play video games, and this popularity has driven concerns about the possible negative effects of this recreational activity.Parents and legislators have long worried about the impact violent games have on  teenagers. The release of the latest Red Dead Redemption (pictured) made headlines around the world In a recent study, researchers looked at the three games participants played most, and noted if they were of a violent nature (such as shooting game Call of Duty) or non-violent (such as Fifa).They tracked the brainwaves of participants using electroencephalography (EEG).At the same time they completed a 'stop-signal task' which contained male and female faces looking either happy or scared.The study found gaming was linked to lower empathy and emotional callousness.Researchers believe this is because it inhibits people's ability to process emotional facial expression and control their responses as a result. 'Studies polling members of the general public as well as scientists suggest views concerning the effects of gaming on young people vary widely as a function of demographics and personal experiences with games.'Some researchers conclude gaming has social and cognitive benefits, whereas others argue the medium contributes to mass-shootings, and for consistent and strong effects on aggressive behaviour, more broadly.The American Psychological Association has warned youngsters' time spent playing video games should be limited.Yet the Australian and Swedish governments have concluded there is no actionable evidence that aggressive behaviour results from youth gaming.Professor Przybylski said: 'The question of whether adolescent engagement with violent video games drives aggressive behaviour in young people is a critically important one.'Indeed, our data indicated these games were regularly played by almost half of female and two-thirds of male teens in the UK.'Given this popularity, one might argue that a small effect linking violent gaming to aggressive behaviour would have consequences for society as a whole.' Co author Dr Netta Weinstein, of Cardiff University, said: 'Our findings suggest researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games.'An important step taken in the study included the researchers publicly registering their hypothesis, methods and analysis technique prior to the start.Professor Przybylski said: 'Part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results.'A cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. The registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.'While no link was found between playing video games and aggressive behaviour in teenagers, the researchers emphasise that this does not mean that some mechanics and situations in gaming do not provoke angry feelings or reactions in players. 'Anecdotally, you do see things such as trash-talking, competitiveness and trolling in gaming communities that could qualify as antisocial behaviour. This would be an interesting avenue for further research,' he added.",1186,1166

Senators voted 23-6 to advance HB220, which signals state support for the company to take large amounts of a kind of low-level radioactive material that grows more hazardous over time. EnergySolutions, based in Salt Lake City, is vying with competitors to take shipments of depleted uranium from government facilities in Ohio and Kentucky — but it still needs to complete a complex and expensive “performance assessment” by state regulators, which was launched in 2012 and is still underway. HB220, which now advances to a final vote of the Senate, essentially assures EnergySolutions that if the company passes that assessment and also gains approval from the head of the state Division of Radiation Control, full state consent for the waste will be granted. Many of the bill’s vocal supporters are recipients of EnergySolutions campaign contributions while not a single one of the senators opposing it took such donations. Supporters on the Senate floor played down safety worries over depleted uranium. Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, said the U.S. faces “a challenge with environmentally responsible ways of dealing with this waste” and that arguments depleted uranium could jeopardize aquifers or pose a public safety hazard on Utah’s roads “are no more valid now than they were 18 years ago.” Sen. Daniel Hemmert, R-Orem, said depleted uranium was already used as a shield in transporting medical waste on public roads, while others noted its widespread use in smoke detectors and exit signs. “And we are not, to my knowledge, dropping dead like flies from exposure,” Hemmert said. “This is the right thing to do.

The website helps to stimulate critical thinking on global climate change by presenting the best pros, cons, and facts so people can formulate their own informed perspectives on this complex and important issue.Natural occurrences, such as changes in the sun's radiation and ocean current shifts, as well as human activities, including burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are reportedly contributing to climate change. Over the 20th century global temperatures have risen between 1 degree F and 1.4 degrees F. This rise has taken place concurrently with a rise in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, loss of sea ice, glacier retreat, sea level rise, more intense heat waves, stronger hurricanes, and more droughts.Several human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (NO2), into the atmosphere. As of Apr. 2010, CO2 levels were 389 parts per million (ppm) - reportedly higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years when levels fluctuated between 180 and 300 ppm.Although there was a period of cooling from 1940 to 1970, and uncertainty exists in computer climate models, many researchers think the earth will continue to warm by 3 - 10 degrees F over the 21st century.Predictions about how climate changes will affect civilization range from an Oct. 2003 Department of Defense report detailing catastrophic weather events and a ""significant drop in the human carrying capacity of the Earth's environment,"" to a Fall 2007 Oregon Institute of Science and Health report detailing ""an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals.""Those who believe humans are causing substantial climate change, including the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), state that greenhouse gas levels rise mainly from human activities. They argue these increases are amplified by natural feedback loops, leading to significant global warming and climate change that will detrimentally effect human civilization, causing flooding, water shortages, hotter summers and colder winters, and decreased crop harvests. Those who believe humans are not substantially contributing to climate change, including the Heartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, argue that the amount of human-generated greenhouse gas increases are too small to substantially change the climate. They state that the earth's forests and oceans are capable of absorbing these small increases, and that 20th century warming has been the result of natural processes including fluctuations in the sun's heat and ocean currents.Did You Know?* As of 2010, the US had 4.5% of world's population but was responsible for about 28% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.* From 1998-2009, the US government appropriated $99 billion for work related to climate change. $35.7 billion (36%) of that total came in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.* A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics showed temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990.

As of Apr. 2010, CO2 levels were 389 parts per million (ppm) - reportedly higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years when levels fluctuated between 180 and 300 ppm.Although there was a period of cooling from 1940 to 1970, and uncertainty exists in computer climate models, many researchers think the earth will continue to warm by 3 - 10 degrees F over the 21st century.Predictions about how climate changes will affect civilization range from an Oct. 2003 Department of Defense report detailing catastrophic weather events and a ""significant drop in the human carrying capacity of the Earth's environment,"" to a Fall 2007 Oregon Institute of Science and Health report detailing ""an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals.""Those who believe humans are causing substantial climate change, including the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), state that greenhouse gas levels rise mainly from human activities. They argue these increases are amplified by natural feedback loops, leading to significant global warming and climate change that will detrimentally effect human civilization, causing flooding, water shortages, hotter summers and colder winters, and decreased crop harvests. Those who believe humans are not substantially contributing to climate change, including the Heartland Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, argue that the amount of human-generated greenhouse gas increases are too small to substantially change the climate. They state that the earth's forests and oceans are capable of absorbing these small increases, and that 20th century warming has been the result of natural processes including fluctuations in the sun's heat and ocean currents.Did You Know?* As of 2010, the US had 4.5% of world's population but was responsible for about 28% of all global greenhouse gas emissions.* From 1998-2009, the US government appropriated $99 billion for work related to climate change. $35.7 billion (36%) of that total came in 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.* A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics showed temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990.

I’m Sarah Green Carmichael.Imagine a virus that infects every computer and electronic device in the United States. And then imagine a terrorist plotting to activate that virus, just as the federal government awakens to the threat and musters its resources to stop it. Except that it’s happening in a dysfunctional political climate, as the president is being impeached.That’s the plot of a new novel titled The President Is Missing. Not only is the protagonist of the book a president, there’s one on the book jacket. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is the coauthor. And he teamed up with author James Patterson to write the thriller.BILL CLINTON: All right, here we are!ADI IGNATIUS: Okay. We’re rolling.SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: They sat down to talk with Harvard Business Review’s editor-in-chief Adi Ignatius about cybersecurity, leadership, and collaboration.ADI IGNATIUS: All right, so let me just say, I’ve read the book, and it’s a lot of fun. The collaboration worked out. I’d love to start by asking you a bit about the collaborative process. So could you tell us a little bit about how this came about?BILL CLINTON: Yeah, our mutual lawyer, agent, friend suggested we do it. I was thrilled. I always wanted to write a mystery and never got around to it, and I was thrilled that Jim agreed.ADI IGNATIUS: So how do you leverage the talents that each side brings to the effort? I mean, is it fair to say that Patterson brings plot and structure, and the president brings kind of inside experiences?JAMES PATTERSON: I think that’s a piece of it. I think what separates this book from thrillers, in general, is just the authenticity. And you know, people, they’ll read a lot of memoirs and more serious, what they consider to be more serious. I don’t think you’re going to get a better portrait of a president, what a president is like than you will in this book. In that sense, it goes way beyond what a thriller normally does. It’s not a thriller. I mean, it is a thriller, but what happens in this book can happen, and we’re not prepared for it.ADI IGNATIUS: So let’s go back to process for a second. So you guys decided you’re going to work together on this. Then what happens? How do you get from that to finished novel?JAMES PATTERSON: Well, what I will do in every book that I do is, is the first thing is an extensive outline. So we just, first of all, started on our, what are possible scenarios that we might want to write about? We’re back and forth, and two or three possible scenarios. We came to the conclusion that we had to get this president out of the White House if we wanted to have an interesting book. And then I’ll just set about going back and forth on an outline until we had an outline that was 40 or 50 pages.BILL CLINTON: And then we just take assignments, or swap out drafts. Jim did the opening, and I had an assignment relating to all the things that President would do in and out of and getting out of the White House. And we did that. And we just kept going back and forth, until we got to the end.ADI IGNATIUS: So every project needs a boss. Who was the boss ultimately on this one?JAMES PATTERSON: I don’t know that every project needs a boss. There were two bosses on this one, and I think we got along well. And there really, I mean, there were no real significant disagreements at all. I think there was just mutual respect. I’ve found, I remember, I did a novel once with a Swedish author, and literally, every single person who came in there said, oh, there’s no way that an American and a Swede could ever get together and work together. And I said, no, we actually, we worked together just fine. If you have mutual respect, and you listen, it usually works.BILL CLINTON: It was a big help, I think, in a way that I never felt insecure in being a neophyte. And the thing that I’ve always been most mystified by once you decide what a novel’s about, and what the general plot is, how you shift and adjust and, you know, he’s the genius on that. And it meant the world to me that, you know, I never felt insecure just asking what must have seemed like stupid questions. And you know, we woke up one day, and I think we got a book on our hands.ADI IGNATIUS: So Jim, what is the most interesting thing you learned from this collaboration with President Clinton?JAMES PATTERSON: One of the things is just how incredibly difficult and important and stressful the job is. And you think you have an idea, but you really don’t have an idea until you start talking to somebody like President Clinton. You know, we’ve had 25 years of people making fun of the presidency, which is, on some level it’s healthy. Saturday Night Live and Scandal and House of Cards. But it diminishes how people feel about the presidency, which is not a good thing. And we both think it’s really important, whatever your political persuasion is, that you take the job incredibly seriously, and you realize how important it is in terms of who you’re going to put in there to do this job. The other thing was understanding what a prison it is to be in the White House and have X number of Secret Service people with you every time you go to the bathroom. You know?ADI IGNATIUS: Keep going on that. I mean, did the president’s insights challenge what you thought you knew about the presidency and about American politics and about Washington?JAMES PATTERSON: As he said, I don’t think he challenged it as much as just listening to him. You know, I would evolve my thinking. You know, I always get a kick out of this thing where people talk about flip-flopping, where somebody changed their mind because they got more information. That’s just being intelligent, I think. So I just kept getting more and more information about what the job was like. And the more I learned, the more I evolved my idea of what the president is. And I realized that it wasn’t that guy in House of Cards.ADI IGNATIUS: And let me flip that. Mr. President, what’s the most interesting thing you learned in working with James Patterson?BILL CLINTON: First of all, I learned a lot about how to construct a novel so that you have a good beginning, an interesting middle and a hell of a close. I learned how important it is to know when you’re veering off track. If you’ve got an instinct that this is just not right, how important it is to develop a plot line that will put it right and keep it interesting. And it sounds self-evident, but it’s not. It’s not easy to do. It’s why when you read a lot of books, particularly in this genre, two-thirds of the book may be great, and the rest may be a slog. But he’s, you know, he’s a genius at keeping it on rhythm. And also, knowing when to have a big shift and how to do it when it’s necessary. I just, I observed such things reading thousands of these over the last 30 something years. But I didn’t know how it was done, and I do now.ADI IGNATIUS: The Washington, DC, that is characterized in the book is, I would say, extremely dysfunctional. I mean, there’s a hero president on one side, and then pretty much a town full of scoundrels beyond that. I mean, is that about right in terms of the real ratio to heroes to jerks in DC?JAMES PATTERSON: I don’t know. I didn’t really get that sense, really, from the book.BILL CLINTON: But I do think, in this case, the president’s more willing to compromise and work with them than they are with him. And I guess a lot of people thought I was trying to recreate the experience of my first term with it, and that’s not true. We were just trying to show what the consequences of political dysfunction are. And they tend to bring resentment in the electorate and get you more dysfunction. So one of the things I tried to do was to make sure the president kept an authentic voice through this whole thing. But keep in mind, in the end, the system does start to rally around, once they dodge a big bullet. And what we are trying to say is, OK, you may have dodged a big bullet, but you don’t want to wait for the next time to do it, and you may need to do something very serious about this issue, too. I mean, I’m surprised that after all these years, we’re 21 years almost since I promulgated the first executive order to study and prevent cyber-attacks and increase cybersecurity, and I’m amazed we don’t spend more money on it than we do.ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, well, let’s talk about that. Because the book obviously describes a very sobering cyberattack on pretty much the entire national infrastructure. How vulnerable is the US to just such an assault, do you think?BILL CLINTON: I think it is vulnerable. And I think, you know, right now, we don’t seem to be doing as much as we could be.JAMES PATTERSON: And this isn’t just us. I mean, we really did a lot of research on this, and a lot of people feel this country is incredibly vulnerable to attacks at this level or below this level, which are really, really serious.BILL CLINTON: I called a number of people I’ve known for 20 years, or more who work in this field, and some younger people. And I said, could this be attacked? Yes. Could that be attacked? Yes. Could the other be attacked? Yes. How would you go about doing it? How would you go about defending against it? And one of the things that surprised me, half of all the private capital on Planet Earth going into private sector cyber-defense was going to Israel. And I know the Israelis have been working on this a long time. It started off when they were worried about, you know, this is years ago, just the elemental threat of cell phones as terror weapons. And it’s continued. But the Germans have had to try to harden their cyber-defenses. And the Russians are in there, because they and the Chinese have been the most successful at cyber-assault.ADI IGNATIUS: So Jim, I’m sure you get asked this all the time, but you know, do you ever fear that writing about terrorist plots could inspire terrorist plots?JAMES PATTERSON: No.ADI IGNATIUS: Explain.BILL CLINTON: I promise you they’re ahead of us. I remember, keep in mind, when 9/11 happened, and remember, one part of 9/11 was the attack on the Pentagon. Tom Clancy had written a novel where there was an attack on the Capitol. But I promise you, the people who did the Pentagon attack were thinking about all by themselves. I’ve often thought that it would be a good thing to have people who do these kinds of books, these thrillers, as well as more serious books, working kind of off the books, if you will, for the government, imagining all kinds of scenarios, and then devising immediate defenses for them. I think that we’ve got to think outside the box on this, and then prepare to spend the money and invest it to do it. It wouldn’t be, it would be very expensive, but nowhere near what we’re spending on the national defense budget, and yet it’s one of the most likely attacks that we could face.ADI IGNATIUS: Let me come back, Mr. President, to what you said about this merely being fiction. As a public figure, it’s inevitable that readers will try to identify people or moments from history and make assumptions about what you’re trying to say as a public figure, and not just a novelist. So any thoughts on that? Or any clues, even, if there is —BILL CLINTON: No, the speech is pretty much what I believe about where we are and what we’re doing, but I tried to write it, you know, we never used the words Republican and Democrat in the whole book. We tried to concentrate on basic American values, and that would be fair. But to draw many other historic parallels would be a mistake. In the last election, a new term entered our lexicon, false equivalency. And I did take a couple of sentences to explain to the reader what that means, because I think people that write about politics just assume that everybody reading knows what that is, and they don’t. So I did that. Otherwise, the whole novel sort of speaks for itself, and is designed to get people to think about cybersecurity and also to think about what it means to be an American in the 21st century, and what we’re really for and what we really believe in.ADI IGNATIUS: I did have that feeling reading the speech, as you say, near the end of the book, that it seemed to be, that was Bill Clinton talking, and Bill Clinton talking in 2018 to the political reality right now.BILL CLINTON: Yeah, but that’s pretty much a speech I’ve been giving since 9/11, and I realized we were in danger of being splintered apart. Then I believe in an interdependent world that we’re the best-positioned country in the world, but only if we keep coming together, not if we’re torn apart.ADI IGNATIUS: The great plot device, obviously, is that the U.S. president goes missing, pretty much completely, for a period of time. When you were in two terms in the White House, was that something you dreamed of, that you could just get off the grid and disappear for a while?BILL CLINTON: Well, occasionally, you know, I wished, I remember, I was out at the Grand Teton mountains a couple of times, and I’d taken a horse. I wish I could have gone alone, or gone with my daughter, but you know, every president had some periods when you’d just like to do something by yourself outside the White House. But it’s very difficult to do. It is possible to do. But very difficult, as you see from book. It’s easier for other people who have Secret Service protection to shed it for a period of time. I thought about it. But I always got over it in a hurry. If the only thing this book tries to do, it tries to give a much-deserved tip of the hat to the Secret Service.ADI IGNATIUS: So just to bring this home, this is a pretty unique collaboration of two people who are kind of at the top of their fields. What’s your advice? How do talented people collaborate most effectively together?BILL CLINTON: Clarity on the objective when you start, and then work hard, be honest and don’t be afraid to admit what you don’t know.JAMES PATTERSON: Actually listen. Whatever preconceptions you may have, what biases, or however much you’ve thought of, you’ve made up your mind, listen to what the other person has to say. And ideally, it’s somebody who you have a lot of respect for. And when that happens, I don’t think, I mean, I didn’t, I really don’t remember anything that the president said where I just went, well, that’s just wrong.BILL CLINTON: Yeah, I agree with that. This was a joy for me. You know, if we didn’t sell ten copies, I’d always be glad we did it, although I’ll be happier if we do better. [LAUGHTER]ADI IGNATIUS: All right, well, thanks for talking to us, and good luck with the book.BILL CLINTON: Thanks, bye.JAMES PATTERSON: Thanks, goodbye.SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s former U.S. President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson.

Otherwise, the whole novel sort of speaks for itself, and is designed to get people to think about cybersecurity and also to think about what it means to be an American in the 21st century, and what we’re really for and what we really believe in.ADI IGNATIUS: I did have that feeling reading the speech, as you say, near the end of the book, that it seemed to be, that was Bill Clinton talking, and Bill Clinton talking in 2018 to the political reality right now.BILL CLINTON: Yeah, but that’s pretty much a speech I’ve been giving since 9/11, and I realized we were in danger of being splintered apart. Then I believe in an interdependent world that we’re the best-positioned country in the world, but only if we keep coming together, not if we’re torn apart.ADI IGNATIUS: The great plot device, obviously, is that the U.S. president goes missing, pretty much completely, for a period of time. When you were in two terms in the White House, was that something you dreamed of, that you could just get off the grid and disappear for a while?BILL CLINTON: Well, occasionally, you know, I wished, I remember, I was out at the Grand Teton mountains a couple of times, and I’d taken a horse. I wish I could have gone alone, or gone with my daughter, but you know, every president had some periods when you’d just like to do something by yourself outside the White House. But it’s very difficult to do. It is possible to do. But very difficult, as you see from book. It’s easier for other people who have Secret Service protection to shed it for a period of time. I thought about it. But I always got over it in a hurry. If the only thing this book tries to do, it tries to give a much-deserved tip of the hat to the Secret Service.ADI IGNATIUS: So just to bring this home, this is a pretty unique collaboration of two people who are kind of at the top of their fields. What’s your advice? How do talented people collaborate most effectively together?BILL CLINTON: Clarity on the objective when you start, and then work hard, be honest and don’t be afraid to admit what you don’t know.JAMES PATTERSON: Actually listen. Whatever preconceptions you may have, what biases, or however much you’ve thought of, you’ve made up your mind, listen to what the other person has to say. And ideally, it’s somebody who you have a lot of respect for. And when that happens, I don’t think, I mean, I didn’t, I really don’t remember anything that the president said where I just went, well, that’s just wrong.BILL CLINTON: Yeah, I agree with that. This was a joy for me. You know, if we didn’t sell ten copies, I’d always be glad we did it, although I’ll be happier if we do better. [LAUGHTER]ADI IGNATIUS: All right, well, thanks for talking to us, and good luck with the book.BILL CLINTON: Thanks, bye.JAMES PATTERSON: Thanks, goodbye.SARAH GREEN CARMICHAEL: That’s former U.S. President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson.

Teachers would only be able to reward students who perform well, not penalize students who fall short.“So little Sally might not do well on that test and she still may need to take the final in that class,” Winder said. “But let’s say little Jose did poorly on the midterm.

He shut down the government for five weeks. Then he clogged up debate on what we should be doing to cure the problems he correctly identifies. Now he has decided to ignore constitutional restraints and declare an emergency just so he can build his wall. The wall has become his white whale. He has taken to prescribing a wall as a solution for every problem. Too many immigrants to the United States? Build a wall. Women are being harassed on the way to the United States? Build a wall. Human trafficking? Build a wall. Drug smuggling? Build a wall. Crime? Build a wall. Global warming? Build a wall. (I’m not kidding; he did at one time propose that the wall feature solar panels). These may all be problems, but they are not problems that a wall could fix. Because of his wall fixation, President Trump has latched onto them. Most of the immigrants who are in the United States illegally got here by overstaying temporary visas. They got here legally but just didn’t leave when they were supposed to. They did not trudge across the desert or wade the river to get into the United States. A wall is not going to keep them out. If we really want to reduce the number of immigrants, we could change the conditions that bring immigrants here. If the West Virginians who migrated to Cleveland and North Carolina could have found just as good a life by staying home, would they have left? Why would anyone make an even bigger jump from Central America to the United States unless they thought they could have a better life? If we want fewer immigrants to make the jump to the United States, we should do what we can to make their lives better in their homes in Central America. There are big problems in some of the places migrants come from. Under the leadership of President Trump, we can’t even think about solutions because we are too focused on the wall. If we want fewer immigrants we could get serious about verifying that job applicants are here legally. It is already illegal to hire non-citizens unless there are no American citizens available to do the job. There is a system that allows employers to electronically verify immigration status. Use of that system is voluntary in most states; were it made mandatory jobs for many immigrants would dry up. That would do more than any wall to reduce the number of immigrants to this country. Drugs are smuggled in through legitimate border crossings, by air, and by sea. They are not coming in the backpacks of people trudging across the desert. If we want to fix that we need more drug sniffing dogs, X-ray machines, or whatever it takes to detect drugs at the border. If we really want to fix it we need to put more effort into curing addiction so that there is less demand for the drugs being imported. The same thing is true with human trafficking. Whether it is for forced labor or forced prostitution, everybody is against it. That’s why President Trump thinks it is such a good argument for building a wall. A wall won’t fix it. President Trump keeps using his example of someone being gagged and thrown into the trunk of a car, something he completely made up. Most victims come in on forged documents or temporary work permits. “Build the wall and crime will fall,” Trump says. There is no evidence that this is true. The evidence is that crime rates are lower in immigrant communities than elsewhere. If we want crime to fall, the thing to do is deport a bunch of American citizens and replace them with immigrants. While nobody is advocating this, that is where the evidence points us. It certainly doesn’t point toward a wall. The question of border security looks intractable. President Trump is obsessed with a wall and won’t accept anything else. The solution starts with President Trump going away. There are other issues he could work on. Maybe it is because he has painted himself into a corner politically. Maybe the word “wall” just got stuck in his head and won’t leave. Whatever it is, he is no longer useful in seeking solutions. We need to run off the ideologues, send home everybody who ever chanted, “Build the Wall!” at Trump rallies, and let people who have studied border security and immigration figure this out. There is data out there. We don’t have to rely upon made up anecdotes. We don’t have to rely upon stereotypes about “bad hombres.” There are people who live and work along the border, people who have spent years gathering and studying data about immigration, drug trafficking and human trafficking. If the data takes us to the conclusion that a wall is the best fix for these problems, then we should build a wall. I would be surprised if it does but if a fair discussion among people who know what they are talking about leads us to a wall then that is what we should do.

J.B. Pritzker's speech - Chicago Sun-Times,"Speaker Madigan, President Cullerton, Leader Durkin, Leader Brady, Lieutenant Governor Stratton, Attorney General Raoul, Secretary White, Comptroller Mendoza, Treasurer Frerichs, Members of the General Assembly, honored guests and citizens, and the extraordinary First Lady of Illinois, my wife MK. Thank you all for your warm welcome.I ask that we begin today by taking a moment to grieve with our neighbors in Aurora over the grave tragedy that occurred less than a week ago. Five good people killed in an evil act of workplace violence. Five police officers who were injured when they ran into gunfire. As I said Friday when I visited Aurora, may the memory of those that we lost be a blessing; may their memory fuel our work to bring peace to our state; and may G-d bless the brave law enforcement officers who continue to run toward danger.Please join me in a moment of silence.Every one of us who serves in public office becomes a student of history. So few people have held these jobs – we must allow the experiences of those who came before us help shape what lies ahead.Every year, the Governor of Illinois is required to provide the General Assembly with a proposed budget and an update on the condition of our state. It’s a tradition in true keeping with our democracy and a task that requires humble honesty and some bold optimism. Today I offer that proposal and report with an eye toward our shared history and our hopes for the future.Illinois’ 200-year history is a web of recurring challenges, the same themes recycling with each new decade. Indeed, when reviewing past reports to the General Assembly by previous governors, the same problems are raised over and over again: There is not enough money to address social ills, not enough jobs to employ people, not enough resources to adequately maintain and build our infrastructure, and not enough attention to the plight of working families. It may not surprise you to learn that these problems existed in 1819, they existed in 1919 and they exist today in 2019.History can be a cruel exercise in pessimism if you narrow your gaze. But if you widen your vision just a little bit, you will see that the recurring reports from the past have been occasionally dotted with unapologetic optimists who focused on tackling old problems with new ideas and new vigor, reducing the burden for each generation along the way.RELATED: Pritzker vows ‘honest’ budget, with big push for progressive income taxOne of those unapologetic optimists was Governor Henry Horner, who took office in 1933. It puts the current day in honest perspective to think about the challenges Horner faced.The Great Depression had just begun…Nearly half of Illinois’ work force was unemployed…Hungry workers were marching on Springfield…Teachers had not received a paycheck in nearly a year…Labor disputes were ending in bloodshed…Banks were shuttering… And to add to it all, floods were sweeping across wide swaths of the state.Nevertheless, with the daunting nature of the state’s condition, Horner approached his job with optimism, with wit and with a dogged work ethic. In a speech soon after he took office, he said:“We have got to hurdle a few more obstacles before we are on the broad highway of return to normal conditions. However, the road is clearly in sight.”Today, that is where we find ourselves again.The road to normal conditions is in sight. However, to get there, we must begin with an honest accounting of the struggles of the last few years and the challenges left behind.Illinois is faced with a $3.2 billion budget deficit and a $15 billion debt from unpaid bills. Last year alone, the state paid out more than $700 million in late payment penalties. That’s enough to cover free four-year university tuition for more than 12,000 students.We are dealing with a fundamental structural deficit that has existed for quite some time and spanned the administrations of several governors. And it won’t be solved until we rethink our spending priorities and some basic revenue issues facing the state.During a time of unprecedented economic growth across the country, we lost four valuable years because of an ideological battle.That stops now.Budgeting will not be done any more by taking the state hostage, or by court orders, consent decrees and continuing appropriations but instead by debate and compromise and a return to regular order. We will work together earnestly to solve the state’s problems. We will disagree at times on important things, but the work we all came here to do will get done.To that end, the budget I present to you today is an honest proposal – the costs are not hidden, the revenues I propose are not out of reach, the hole we need to fill is not ignored. There’s no fantasy line item called “Working together or executive management.” Instead this budget proposal reflects some of my most deeply held values – and the hopes of voters who sent us here – but tempered by the knowledge that we must hold the line on spending in the context of the revenue available and the diminished condition of our state government.Undoubtedly all of you will bring your own priorities, ideas, and concerns to the budget process. I welcome that conversation – that’s as it should be. We are all here, Democrats and Republicans, with the common desire to serve the people of our state well. And we do that better when we talk to each other, and more importantly, listen to each other.I have tried in the weeks leading up to today to get to know each of you, to meet your families, to dance together to Maroon 5 songs, and to have an open door to conversation and collegiality and finding common ground. As it turns out, some of you are pretty good dancers! Some of us, not so much.All I’m suggesting is I don’t think we spend enough time getting to know one another as people before we get to know one another as political opponents.My first week here, Senator Sue Rezin stopped by the Governor’s office to introduce herself. I invited her to sit with me so I could learn about her district and, we talked about how we can attract more business to Northern Illinois.I found out a little bit more about Sue. She’s a mom of four, runs a real estate business with her husband, and started volunteering for the Make-A-Wish foundation 30 years ago when she was first starting her family because it offered her a flexible schedule. I gotta say I’m not sure how a Mom of four finds any flexibility in her schedule but I’m impressed with the tremendous generosity of spirit that she looked for the opportunity to give her time to those in need when she must have barely had any time for herself.I will not soon forget, even when we inevitably disagree, that Senator Rezin extended a hand in friendship to me on my first few days on the job. Sue makes no bones about being a conservative. And I’m not shy to say I’m a Democrat. But I know we will get more done for Illinois by listening to each other, which we will do with respect and civility.It is with the knowledge that people with true generosity of spirit occupy both sides of the aisle here in Springfield, that I set out on the task of providing a new direction for our state. This is not the work of just one year. Real fiscal stability requires a long-term commitment to paying down debt, investing in critical infrastructure, and stabilizing our pension system.It also requires a recognition that to lower costs and increase revenue over the long term we must make investments in education, livable wages, innovative human service programs and job training. We must stop slashing programs that build future prosperity – if we cut skills training and college affordability, we curb near term economic growth, lower our prospects for future revenue, and drive businesses away. If we don’t fund inexpensive gun violence prevention programs, we will see more tragedy and higher public safety expenditures. If we don’t have strong social service programs that assist families dealing with a loved one’s mental health crisis, then we increase a family’s suffering and increase the potential future financial burden on the state. In the past it has been the practice of too many politicians to be short sighted about slashing costs and then to bemoan the state of the state when those cuts have long-term consequences on the economy.So let’s not hollow out vital government services any more.Instead, we must focus on making government more efficient and effective. Let’s make sure we are focused on truly managing and measuring the real results of state programs. Taxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent wisely. Programs that don’t work need to be eliminated. And we need to explore new ways to address old problems.Efficiently saving tax dollars, though, isn’t enough to lift Illinois out of our fiscal mess. We must also grow jobs.We can do that by fostering a business environment in Illinois that will attract talent and entrepreneurs from all over the country. We need to continue to grow our position as a top-tier startup and technology ecosystem, and we are doing that in this budget with new investments and by re-prioritizing dollars within the departments of our state government.We are a big state with real infrastructure and transportation options, world class logistics companies and some of the busiest distribution centers in the nation. We must be prepared to make a big investment in our transportation and infrastructure with the passage of a Capital Bill that will be introduced in this legislative session.We can grow our economy and make it more inclusive by taking advantage of the talent among the diverse people of our state. That’s why we must promote the development of sustained wealth in black and brown communities by being purposeful about increasing the number of minority-owned businesses eligible for state procurement opportunities and by attracting private capital to build out new businesses and jobs in Opportunity Zones. And I want downstate Republicans and Democrats to work together with me on a Downstate Revitalization Plan to encourage the creation of new businesses and jobs and foster the growth of existing ones in struggling communities so they can thrive.To get to fiscal stability and eliminate our structural deficit, there’s no quick fix. It took decades to get us into this mess. It will take at least several years to get us out of it.We must therefore embrace a multi-year approach with fair principles and smart investments in our people. Our state does well when our people do well.I want to be clear about this…this Fiscal Year 2020 budget is balanced, but that’s not enough. This is only Year One of a multi-year endeavor, and very importantly it is built on the state’s current regressive tax structure that I do not favor and that puts the greatest burden on working families. Not only is our tax system unfair, it’s also inadequate to solve our long-term financial challenges.It’s time for a change.Workers deserve an income tax cut and a property tax break. A fair tax system will allow us to eliminate the structural deficit that has plagued our state for nearly two decades.There is unanimous agreement in this room that if we want to solve our state’s fiscal woes we cannot continue on the path we are on. There is a structural deficit today of over $3 billion per year that if left unaddressed will continue to grow. There is a backlog of unpaid bills and debt associated with it that exceeds $15 billion. In addition there is a built-in multi-billion-dollar deficit of funding for schools and universities and human services that most families rely upon.For the sake of argument let’s agree that there’s at least a need to address the structural deficit with enough to pay off the backlog over several years. We are talking about billions of dollars each year to fill the hole in our future budgets.There are, in essence, three alternative options for fixing this problem:First, we could choose only to cut state government spending and raise no revenue. To do that, we have to recognize that out of this year’s $39 billion budget, approximately $20 billion is required payments on our debt, on our pensions, on our court-ordered obligations or federally protected programs. That leaves approximately $19 billion dollars. That’s the money we spend educating our children, running our colleges and universities, keeping our streets safe, preserving our natural resources, getting people to and from work efficiently and caring for our veterans. We’ll call that “discretionary spending.” To balance the budget by simply cutting government, we would have to reduce discretionary spending on all these direct services our jobs, our families and our businesses rely on by approximately 15%. That’s 15% fewer state police, 15% fewer students going to college, 15% fewer working parents receiving child care assistance, and 15% less money for your local schools – which likely also means your local property taxes will increase. I should point out that this option was tried in the prior administration, and it failed – because nearly no one thinks it’s a good idea to force our most talented kids to leave the state by diminishing Illinois colleges and universities, drive families away by defunding local schools, make our communities less safe by reducing public safety, and increase poverty by cutting badly needed human services.Our second option is to raise revenue with our current regressive flat income tax system and impose more flat taxes which fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class. This option could require imposing sales taxes on services, implementing a retirement tax, or raising the income tax overall by around 20%. Or all of the above. For a family earning $100,000, that means paying almost a thousand dollars more in income taxes, and their property taxes will continue their upward march as they always have.Our third option is to reject imposing additional income, retirement and sales taxes on the middle class and instead enact a fair income tax. This would lift some of the tax burden off of middle income earners and instead ask the wealthiest to pay a little more. Just for clarity, a fair tax is what three quarters of states with income taxes have. We can accomplish this with a more competitive rate structure than Wisconsin and Iowa, both of which are outpacing Illinois in job creation and economic growth. We can also implement a fair tax system that’s lower than our metropolitan competitors on the east and west coasts.Make no bones about it, I choose to stand up for working families and will lead the charge to finally enact a fair tax system in Illinois.Ultimately, our chief responsibility to the people of Illinois is to set this state on a path to sustainable growth with an income tax system that is fair. It is not fair that I pay the same tax rate as a teacher, a child care worker, a police officer or a nurse. And efforts to simply increase the income tax rate across the board fuels further income inequality and kicks the can down the road for our children and grandchildren to solve our ongoing budget issues. The state needs a fair tax, and I am going to be relentless in pursuing one over the next two years.My office intends to immediately begin negotiations over proposed fair tax rates with leaders from the House and Senate. Conversations and debate about rate structures and how much revenue we need to raise are appropriate. I expect different opinions and viewpoints over the best way to achieve an equitable tax system, and I sincerely welcome that conversation. I have already asked a few legislators who oppose the fair tax to offer their best ideas to improve it, and I am confident they will come to the table in good faith.What is not appropriate is a small collection of the wealthiest people thinking that they should drown out millions of lower and middle income Illinoisans unfairly burdened by the current flat tax system.Now, I understand that I am an unlikely proponent for this much needed change. But perhaps the fact that the heaviest burdens would fall on taxpayers like myself under a new fair tax system will convince many of you that I am proposing this path forward because I truly believe it’s what is best for Illinois.To fix our state’s problems, we need fundamental tax reform. There’s no hiding from it. There’s no running from it. There’s no lying about it. I choose a fair tax system to get us out of this mess.It will take 18 months to get it done, but it’s worth the wait so we can save working families hundreds or thousands of dollars per year.A fair tax will change the arc of Illinois’ finances forever.Until then, this proposed budget serves as a bridge to a stable fiscal future.Which is why I am proposing a fiscal year 2020 budget with re-prioritized and controlled spending that targets increases in three key areas that will help our state thrive and grow: education, health and human services, and public safety – investments in people that I believe will pay dividends down the road. This is a constrained budget – more austere than I would like – but I think it’s important that we be disciplined and focused over the next few years to pay down our bill backlog and the debt left over from prior administrations.The responsible course of action is to embrace some near term reasonable – and realistic – new revenue, which will bring in an estimated $1.1 billion in total.Let’s begin with this: By legalizing and regulating adult-use cannabis in this legislative session, we will create jobs and bring in $170 million in licensing and other fees in fiscal year 2020. I have noted many times that I don’t view this issue through a purely financial lens. I think we should take this action for our state because of the beneficial criminal and social justice implications and the jobs it will create. And let’s be honest, like it or not, cannabis is readily available right now. I would rather the state tax it and regulate it than deny the reality of its use and accessibility.This budget also includes the legalization and taxation of sports betting. Expansion of gambling is a perennial effort in this state, and often these proposals get bogged down in regional disputes and a Christmas tree approach. But in those instances, we were talking about adding more riverboats or adding into other regions. Sports betting is different – this is a new market created by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. Every day we argue about “who’s in and who’s out” is money that goes to other states and to the black market. I am calling on the legislature to take this up immediately so that Illinois can realize hundreds of millions of dollars, create new jobs, and bring sports betting into a regulated environment that will protect citizens from bad actors. If we do it this year and become the first state in the Midwest to move on this initiative, we can realize more than $200 million from sports betting fees and taxes in FY 2020.I am also proposing that Illinois enact a tax on insurance companies, specifically a managed care organization assessment to help cover the costs of the State’s Medicaid program — something that Leader Greg Harris has championed for many years and that has been enacted in other states. This would be structured to generate approximately $390 million in revenue to cover a portion of the state’s Medicaid costs. This would be a smart way to increase our federal match.Bringing efficiencies to state government in addition to these new revenues is not enough for Illinois to reach firm fiscal footing. We must address our pension liabilities. Throughout my campaign I said that we must pay the pensions that are owed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that. And therefore that is what we must do. So I am proposing a responsible approach to our pensions that does not crowd out all the other investments we must make so that Illinois is a state that thrives.Twenty-five years ago, when the pension payment schedule was put in place, the well-intentioned architects of it predicted that in fiscal year 2020 we would spend $4.9 billion on pensions. Instead, the bill today is $9.1 billion. Nearly double. This must not continue. We must put the system on a more sustainable path – one that preserves pensions for the retirees that earned them, and at the same time allows us to grow our economy and grow our way out of the pension liability.And last week, my administration put forward a 5-point program to do just that. We will dedicate a portion of the new fair income tax – in other words, hundreds of millions of dollars – to the pension system, over and above our required pension payments. We will infuse new assets into the system up front. We will manage our debt through a small-scale pension bond used entirely for reducing our liability. We will make the optional retiree buyout program permanent. And we will smooth the pension ramp by modestly extending it.This approach is not one that can be looked at as a menu from which to pick one and discard the rest. There’s no room for that any more. We must attack our pension liability from many angles all at once. And we must be consistent and persistent in this battle.Some will criticize this approach. There are those who will say that retirees should lose the benefits they earned. The Supreme Court has made it clear that that is illegal. There are others who would raise taxes on middle class families today. I say middle class families have paid enough.I promised to be honest about our challenges and solutions. This is the most responsible, sustainable and balanced approach to dealing with a problem that was decades in the making and will take years to solve.Ultimately, the fair tax must be part of the long term solution to our pensions.There are many education, healthcare and job creation initiatives that I think are well worth funding and many opportunities for investments across the state that I talked about during my campaign. But state government today can only do so much, and without a commitment to reaching firm fiscal ground, we will soon be able to do even less. My highest priorities are stabilizing state government, growing our economy, and protecting working families.For our fiscal and economic health, we must start with a sustained effort to restore and improve our education system.I have been advocating for large investments in early childhood education for decades, long before I became governor. Real focus on the learning that happens from birth to age 5 can determine the entire arc of a person’s life. Investing in early childhood is the single most important education policy decision government can make, and it has proven to provide a significant return on investment. That’s why I’m proposing funding the Early Childhood Block Grant at $594 million, an increase of $100 million from fiscal year 2019. It will allow us to begin the march toward universal preschool so that every child in Illinois will have a real opportunity to succeed.I have also focused on reversing the damage done to higher education by the budget impasse. College affordability is a paramount investment in near term economic growth for our state. So I’ve proposed a 5 percent increase for public universities and community colleges, as well as an increase in the Monetary Award Program by $50 million to help more than 15,000 more low- and moderate-income students attend college next year. We will do more every year to come. I’m also proposing $35 million for the second-year costs of the AIM HIGH merit scholarship program for high achieving students – so we can keep our best and brightest in Illinois.On a smaller scale, I am consistently looking to maintain or increase funding for programs that have an outsized benefit to the economy for traditionally neglected communities. Along those lines, this budget includes funding for the Advanced Placement Low-Income Test Fee Waiver. The $94 it costs to take an AP History exam is a huge burden for a low-income family. We must be ever mindful of how we as a society inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of poverty and the ways, both large and small, that we can help people find a way out.In my inaugural address I said that I would not balance a budget on the backs of the starving, the sick and the suffering, and I keep that promise today by beginning to rebuild health and human services.We increase the income eligibility threshold in the Child Care Assistance Program which will give quality care to approximately 10,000 more children. We provide funding to open the new 200-bed Chicago Veterans’ Home, long delayed by the budget impasse. We will be able to hire an additional 126 direct service staff for DCFS to protect children. We will provide funding to help investigate cases of kids’ exposure to lead – this is important, because we have raised our standards to be more aggressive. This budget adds funds for community-based violence interruption, homelessness prevention, behavioral health, mental health, addiction, dementia, and Alzheimer’s.This is less than what I would like to do. But it is what we can afford to do in year one of our recovery.As another part of my plan to strengthen working families, we are giving 1.4 million Illinoisans a raise.Our country is engaged in a serious conversation about income inequality right now. I think that’s long overdue. There was a time where we operated with a general philosophy that workers should be able to afford the goods and services that they help to produce. That’s not some outdated notion. It’s fundamentally American.Many of you asked me why I made passing a $15 minimum wage an immediate priority given all the challenges our state faces right now.The current minimum wage is $8.25 an hour – which means even if you are working full time every week out of the year, you are making $17,000 a year. You can’t send your kids to college on $17,000 a year. You can’t afford a single health emergency, or pay for any of the things that might prevent a health emergency. You can’t sustain child care on $17,000 a year. And you can’t save for retirement. A flat tire or a worn car battery is a genuine fiscal emergency that might also threaten your job. And one paycheck is often the only firewall against homelessness.The current minimum wage is a lifetime sentence to poverty.Whether you live in Chicago or Cairo, I find that unacceptable, and I worked with the appropriate amount of haste to change it. When your house is burning down, you don’t wait for the rain to put out the fire.I said I would put Springfield back on the side of working families, and I meant it.Finally, we will do more to keep our neighbors safe in the state of Illinois. This begins with making sure the Illinois State Police can be rebuilt, with two new cadet classes to replenish their dwindling ranks. We will pay for the gun dealer licensing law that I was proud to sign during my first week in office, to take a reasonable step to end the scourge of gun violence in too many of our neighborhoods. We will take a more rigorous approach to getting guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them in the first place. I’m committed to advocating for commonsense gun laws, and I’m committed to making sure that we are implementing the laws we already have on the books more effectively. These investments have taken on an even greater importance since the massacre in Aurora, which serves as a poignant and painful reminder of the work that still remains.Every governor deals with their share of trials, tumult and tribulation.I mentioned at the beginning of this speech that Henry Horner took office in 1933 at the start of the worst decade of economic decline in US history.Horner was good friends with Carl Sandburg. They shared a love of all things related to President Lincoln. In the later years of his life, Sandburg granted an interview about his friend Governor Horner, in which he said, “Horner was the real goods…he got to high places without selling his soul.”Indeed, despite all the economic struggles the state faced during the Great Depression, Horner still managed to increase school funding, institute unemployment insurance and pensions for older Illinoisans, create building programs for state institutions and improve public health services.He understood that prosperity doesn’t trickle down…it trickles up. When we lift up those who have the least, our boats all rise together.Horner was a fundamentally optimistic man. He approached his job as governor with a hopeful heart, and he never let that hope diminish under the uncommon burdens of being head of state.He knew what I know…that the state of our state has always been strong because of the values of our people…not the value of our coffers.Horner once said: “The only way to carry out any great purpose is not on your shoulders, but in your heart. Carry it on your backs and it may wear you down. Carry it in your hearts and it will lift you up. Thus, the heart strengthens the purpose, and the purpose gives poise and inspiration to the will.”Like you, I carry the burdens of this state in my heart – and despite the heavy load it lifts me up every day. I share my purpose with you so that it may give poise and inspiration to our collective will – because I know the road ahead is hard, but I think it’s about time we all walk it together.Thank you.Subscribe to our breaking news mailing listDarvish turning corner; Maddon mulling DH optionsLeslie Alarcon-Arajuo, 14, has been missing from Back of the Yards since Saturday.

J.B.

Thank you all for your warm welcome.I ask that we begin today by taking a moment to grieve with our neighbors in Aurora over the grave tragedy that occurred less than a week ago. Five good people killed in an evil act of workplace violence. Five police officers who were injured when they ran into gunfire. As I said Friday when I visited Aurora, may the memory of those that we lost be a blessing; may their memory fuel our work to bring peace to our state; and may G-d bless the brave law enforcement officers who continue to run toward danger.Please join me in a moment of silence.Every one of us who serves in public office becomes a student of history. So few people have held these jobs – we must allow the experiences of those who came before us help shape what lies ahead.Every year, the Governor of Illinois is required to provide the General Assembly with a proposed budget and an update on the condition of our state. It’s a tradition in true keeping with our democracy and a task that requires humble honesty and some bold optimism. Today I offer that proposal and report with an eye toward our shared history and our hopes for the future.Illinois’ 200-year history is a web of recurring challenges, the same themes recycling with each new decade. Indeed, when reviewing past reports to the General Assembly by previous governors, the same problems are raised over and over again: There is not enough money to address social ills, not enough jobs to employ people, not enough resources to adequately maintain and build our infrastructure, and not enough attention to the plight of working families. It may not surprise you to learn that these problems existed in 1819, they existed in 1919 and they exist today in 2019.History can be a cruel exercise in pessimism if you narrow your gaze. But if you widen your vision just a little bit, you will see that the recurring reports from the past have been occasionally dotted with unapologetic optimists who focused on tackling old problems with new ideas and new vigor, reducing the burden for each generation along the way.RELATED: Pritzker vows ‘honest’ budget, with big push for progressive income taxOne of those unapologetic optimists was Governor Henry Horner, who took office in 1933. It puts the current day in honest perspective to think about the challenges Horner faced.The Great Depression had just begun…Nearly half of Illinois’ work force was unemployed…Hungry workers were marching on Springfield…Teachers had not received a paycheck in nearly a year…Labor disputes were ending in bloodshed…Banks were shuttering… And to add to it all, floods were sweeping across wide swaths of the state.Nevertheless, with the daunting nature of the state’s condition, Horner approached his job with optimism, with wit and with a dogged work ethic. In a speech soon after he took office, he said:“We have got to hurdle a few more obstacles before we are on the broad highway of return to normal conditions. However, the road is clearly in sight.”Today, that is where we find ourselves again.The road to normal conditions is in sight. However, to get there, we must begin with an honest accounting of the struggles of the last few years and the challenges left behind.Illinois is faced with a $3.2 billion budget deficit and a $15 billion debt from unpaid bills. Last year alone, the state paid out more than $700 million in late payment penalties. That’s enough to cover free four-year university tuition for more than 12,000 students.We are dealing with a fundamental structural deficit that has existed for quite some time and spanned the administrations of several governors. And it won’t be solved until we rethink our spending priorities and some basic revenue issues facing the state.During a time of unprecedented economic growth across the country, we lost four valuable years because of an ideological battle.That stops now.Budgeting will not be done any more by taking the state hostage, or by court orders, consent decrees and continuing appropriations but instead by debate and compromise and a return to regular order. We will work together earnestly to solve the state’s problems. We will disagree at times on important things, but the work we all came here to do will get done.To that end, the budget I present to you today is an honest proposal – the costs are not hidden, the revenues I propose are not out of reach, the hole we need to fill is not ignored. There’s no fantasy line item called “Working together or executive management.” Instead this budget proposal reflects some of my most deeply held values – and the hopes of voters who sent us here – but tempered by the knowledge that we must hold the line on spending in the context of the revenue available and the diminished condition of our state government.Undoubtedly all of you will bring your own priorities, ideas, and concerns to the budget process. I welcome that conversation – that’s as it should be. We are all here, Democrats and Republicans, with the common desire to serve the people of our state well. And we do that better when we talk to each other, and more importantly, listen to each other.I have tried in the weeks leading up to today to get to know each of you, to meet your families, to dance together to Maroon 5 songs, and to have an open door to conversation and collegiality and finding common ground. As it turns out, some of you are pretty good dancers! Some of us, not so much.All I’m suggesting is I don’t think we spend enough time getting to know one another as people before we get to know one another as political opponents.My first week here, Senator Sue Rezin stopped by the Governor’s office to introduce herself. I invited her to sit with me so I could learn about her district and, we talked about how we can attract more business to Northern Illinois.I found out a little bit more about Sue. She’s a mom of four, runs a real estate business with her husband, and started volunteering for the Make-A-Wish foundation 30 years ago when she was first starting her family because it offered her a flexible schedule. I gotta say I’m not sure how a Mom of four finds any flexibility in her schedule but I’m impressed with the tremendous generosity of spirit that she looked for the opportunity to give her time to those in need when she must have barely had any time for herself.I will not soon forget, even when we inevitably disagree, that Senator Rezin extended a hand in friendship to me on my first few days on the job. Sue makes no bones about being a conservative. And I’m not shy to say I’m a Democrat. But I know we will get more done for Illinois by listening to each other, which we will do with respect and civility.It is with the knowledge that people with true generosity of spirit occupy both sides of the aisle here in Springfield, that I set out on the task of providing a new direction for our state. This is not the work of just one year. Real fiscal stability requires a long-term commitment to paying down debt, investing in critical infrastructure, and stabilizing our pension system.It also requires a recognition that to lower costs and increase revenue over the long term we must make investments in education, livable wages, innovative human service programs and job training. We must stop slashing programs that build future prosperity – if we cut skills training and college affordability, we curb near term economic growth, lower our prospects for future revenue, and drive businesses away. If we don’t fund inexpensive gun violence prevention programs, we will see more tragedy and higher public safety expenditures. If we don’t have strong social service programs that assist families dealing with a loved one’s mental health crisis, then we increase a family’s suffering and increase the potential future financial burden on the state. In the past it has been the practice of too many politicians to be short sighted about slashing costs and then to bemoan the state of the state when those cuts have long-term consequences on the economy.So let’s not hollow out vital government services any more.Instead, we must focus on making government more efficient and effective. Let’s make sure we are focused on truly managing and measuring the real results of state programs. Taxpayers deserve to know their dollars are being spent wisely. Programs that don’t work need to be eliminated. And we need to explore new ways to address old problems.Efficiently saving tax dollars, though, isn’t enough to lift Illinois out of our fiscal mess. We must also grow jobs.We can do that by fostering a business environment in Illinois that will attract talent and entrepreneurs from all over the country. We need to continue to grow our position as a top-tier startup and technology ecosystem, and we are doing that in this budget with new investments and by re-prioritizing dollars within the departments of our state government.We are a big state with real infrastructure and transportation options, world class logistics companies and some of the busiest distribution centers in the nation. We must be prepared to make a big investment in our transportation and infrastructure with the passage of a Capital Bill that will be introduced in this legislative session.We can grow our economy and make it more inclusive by taking advantage of the talent among the diverse people of our state. That’s why we must promote the development of sustained wealth in black and brown communities by being purposeful about increasing the number of minority-owned businesses eligible for state procurement opportunities and by attracting private capital to build out new businesses and jobs in Opportunity Zones. And I want downstate Republicans and Democrats to work together with me on a Downstate Revitalization Plan to encourage the creation of new businesses and jobs and foster the growth of existing ones in struggling communities so they can thrive.To get to fiscal stability and eliminate our structural deficit, there’s no quick fix. It took decades to get us into this mess. It will take at least several years to get us out of it.We must therefore embrace a multi-year approach with fair principles and smart investments in our people. Our state does well when our people do well.I want to be clear about this…this Fiscal Year 2020 budget is balanced, but that’s not enough. This is only Year One of a multi-year endeavor, and very importantly it is built on the state’s current regressive tax structure that I do not favor and that puts the greatest burden on working families. Not only is our tax system unfair, it’s also inadequate to solve our long-term financial challenges.It’s time for a change.Workers deserve an income tax cut and a property tax break. A fair tax system will allow us to eliminate the structural deficit that has plagued our state for nearly two decades.There is unanimous agreement in this room that if we want to solve our state’s fiscal woes we cannot continue on the path we are on. There is a structural deficit today of over $3 billion per year that if left unaddressed will continue to grow. There is a backlog of unpaid bills and debt associated with it that exceeds $15 billion. In addition there is a built-in multi-billion-dollar deficit of funding for schools and universities and human services that most families rely upon.For the sake of argument let’s agree that there’s at least a need to address the structural deficit with enough to pay off the backlog over several years. We are talking about billions of dollars each year to fill the hole in our future budgets.There are, in essence, three alternative options for fixing this problem:First, we could choose only to cut state government spending and raise no revenue. To do that, we have to recognize that out of this year’s $39 billion budget, approximately $20 billion is required payments on our debt, on our pensions, on our court-ordered obligations or federally protected programs. That leaves approximately $19 billion dollars. That’s the money we spend educating our children, running our colleges and universities, keeping our streets safe, preserving our natural resources, getting people to and from work efficiently and caring for our veterans. We’ll call that “discretionary spending.” To balance the budget by simply cutting government, we would have to reduce discretionary spending on all these direct services our jobs, our families and our businesses rely on by approximately 15%. That’s 15% fewer state police, 15% fewer students going to college, 15% fewer working parents receiving child care assistance, and 15% less money for your local schools – which likely also means your local property taxes will increase. I should point out that this option was tried in the prior administration, and it failed – because nearly no one thinks it’s a good idea to force our most talented kids to leave the state by diminishing Illinois colleges and universities, drive families away by defunding local schools, make our communities less safe by reducing public safety, and increase poverty by cutting badly needed human services.Our second option is to raise revenue with our current regressive flat income tax system and impose more flat taxes which fall disproportionately on the working poor and the middle class. This option could require imposing sales taxes on services, implementing a retirement tax, or raising the income tax overall by around 20%. Or all of the above. For a family earning $100,000, that means paying almost a thousand dollars more in income taxes, and their property taxes will continue their upward march as they always have.Our third option is to reject imposing additional income, retirement and sales taxes on the middle class and instead enact a fair income tax. This would lift some of the tax burden off of middle income earners and instead ask the wealthiest to pay a little more. Just for clarity, a fair tax is what three quarters of states with income taxes have. We can accomplish this with a more competitive rate structure than Wisconsin and Iowa, both of which are outpacing Illinois in job creation and economic growth. We can also implement a fair tax system that’s lower than our metropolitan competitors on the east and west coasts.Make no bones about it, I choose to stand up for working families and will lead the charge to finally enact a fair tax system in Illinois.Ultimately, our chief responsibility to the people of Illinois is to set this state on a path to sustainable growth with an income tax system that is fair. It is not fair that I pay the same tax rate as a teacher, a child care worker, a police officer or a nurse. And efforts to simply increase the income tax rate across the board fuels further income inequality and kicks the can down the road for our children and grandchildren to solve our ongoing budget issues. The state needs a fair tax, and I am going to be relentless in pursuing one over the next two years.My office intends to immediately begin negotiations over proposed fair tax rates with leaders from the House and Senate. Conversations and debate about rate structures and how much revenue we need to raise are appropriate. I expect different opinions and viewpoints over the best way to achieve an equitable tax system, and I sincerely welcome that conversation. I have already asked a few legislators who oppose the fair tax to offer their best ideas to improve it, and I am confident they will come to the table in good faith.What is not appropriate is a small collection of the wealthiest people thinking that they should drown out millions of lower and middle income Illinoisans unfairly burdened by the current flat tax system.Now, I understand that I am an unlikely proponent for this much needed change. But perhaps the fact that the heaviest burdens would fall on taxpayers like myself under a new fair tax system will convince many of you that I am proposing this path forward because I truly believe it’s what is best for Illinois.To fix our state’s problems, we need fundamental tax reform. There’s no hiding from it. There’s no running from it. There’s no lying about it. I choose a fair tax system to get us out of this mess.It will take 18 months to get it done, but it’s worth the wait so we can save working families hundreds or thousands of dollars per year.A fair tax will change the arc of Illinois’ finances forever.Until then, this proposed budget serves as a bridge to a stable fiscal future.Which is why I am proposing a fiscal year 2020 budget with re-prioritized and controlled spending that targets increases in three key areas that will help our state thrive and grow: education, health and human services, and public safety – investments in people that I believe will pay dividends down the road. This is a constrained budget – more austere than I would like – but I think it’s important that we be disciplined and focused over the next few years to pay down our bill backlog and the debt left over from prior administrations.The responsible course of action is to embrace some near term reasonable – and realistic – new revenue, which will bring in an estimated $1.1 billion in total.Let’s begin with this: By legalizing and regulating adult-use cannabis in this legislative session, we will create jobs and bring in $170 million in licensing and other fees in fiscal year 2020. I have noted many times that I don’t view this issue through a purely financial lens. I think we should take this action for our state because of the beneficial criminal and social justice implications and the jobs it will create. And let’s be honest, like it or not, cannabis is readily available right now. I would rather the state tax it and regulate it than deny the reality of its use and accessibility.This budget also includes the legalization and taxation of sports betting. Expansion of gambling is a perennial effort in this state, and often these proposals get bogged down in regional disputes and a Christmas tree approach. But in those instances, we were talking about adding more riverboats or adding into other regions. Sports betting is different – this is a new market created by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. Every day we argue about “who’s in and who’s out” is money that goes to other states and to the black market. I am calling on the legislature to take this up immediately so that Illinois can realize hundreds of millions of dollars, create new jobs, and bring sports betting into a regulated environment that will protect citizens from bad actors. If we do it this year and become the first state in the Midwest to move on this initiative, we can realize more than $200 million from sports betting fees and taxes in FY 2020.I am also proposing that Illinois enact a tax on insurance companies, specifically a managed care organization assessment to help cover the costs of the State’s Medicaid program — something that Leader Greg Harris has championed for many years and that has been enacted in other states. This would be structured to generate approximately $390 million in revenue to cover a portion of the state’s Medicaid costs. This would be a smart way to increase our federal match.Bringing efficiencies to state government in addition to these new revenues is not enough for Illinois to reach firm fiscal footing. We must address our pension liabilities. Throughout my campaign I said that we must pay the pensions that are owed, and the Supreme Court has ruled that. And therefore that is what we must do.

We will dedicate a portion of the new fair income tax – in other words, hundreds of millions of dollars – to the pension system, over and above our required pension payments. We will infuse new assets into the system up front. We will manage our debt through a small-scale pension bond used entirely for reducing our liability. We will make the optional retiree buyout program permanent. And we will smooth the pension ramp by modestly extending it.This approach is not one that can be looked at as a menu from which to pick one and discard the rest. There’s no room for that any more. We must attack our pension liability from many angles all at once. And we must be consistent and persistent in this battle.Some will criticize this approach. There are those who will say that retirees should lose the benefits they earned. The Supreme Court has made it clear that that is illegal. There are others who would raise taxes on middle class families today. I say middle class families have paid enough.I promised to be honest about our challenges and solutions. This is the most responsible, sustainable and balanced approach to dealing with a problem that was decades in the making and will take years to solve.Ultimately, the fair tax must be part of the long term solution to our pensions.There are many education, healthcare and job creation initiatives that I think are well worth funding and many opportunities for investments across the state that I talked about during my campaign. But state government today can only do so much, and without a commitment to reaching firm fiscal ground, we will soon be able to do even less. My highest priorities are stabilizing state government, growing our economy, and protecting working families.For our fiscal and economic health, we must start with a sustained effort to restore and improve our education system.I have been advocating for large investments in early childhood education for decades, long before I became governor. Real focus on the learning that happens from birth to age 5 can determine the entire arc of a person’s life. Investing in early childhood is the single most important education policy decision government can make, and it has proven to provide a significant return on investment. That’s why I’m proposing funding the Early Childhood Block Grant at $594 million, an increase of $100 million from fiscal year 2019. It will allow us to begin the march toward universal preschool so that every child in Illinois will have a real opportunity to succeed.I have also focused on reversing the damage done to higher education by the budget impasse. College affordability is a paramount investment in near term economic growth for our state. So I’ve proposed a 5 percent increase for public universities and community colleges, as well as an increase in the Monetary Award Program by $50 million to help more than 15,000 more low- and moderate-income students attend college next year. We will do more every year to come. I’m also proposing $35 million for the second-year costs of the AIM HIGH merit scholarship program for high achieving students – so we can keep our best and brightest in Illinois.On a smaller scale, I am consistently looking to maintain or increase funding for programs that have an outsized benefit to the economy for traditionally neglected communities. Along those lines, this budget includes funding for the Advanced Placement Low-Income Test Fee Waiver. The $94 it costs to take an AP History exam is a huge burden for a low-income family. We must be ever mindful of how we as a society inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of poverty and the ways, both large and small, that we can help people find a way out.In my inaugural address I said that I would not balance a budget on the backs of the starving, the sick and the suffering, and I keep that promise today by beginning to rebuild health and human services.We increase the income eligibility threshold in the Child Care Assistance Program which will give quality care to approximately 10,000 more children. We provide funding to open the new 200-bed Chicago Veterans’ Home, long delayed by the budget impasse. We will be able to hire an additional 126 direct service staff for DCFS to protect children. We will provide funding to help investigate cases of kids’ exposure to lead – this is important, because we have raised our standards to be more aggressive. This budget adds funds for community-based violence interruption, homelessness prevention, behavioral health, mental health, addiction, dementia, and Alzheimer’s.This is less than what I would like to do. But it is what we can afford to do in year one of our recovery.As another part of my plan to strengthen working families, we are giving 1.4 million Illinoisans a raise.Our country is engaged in a serious conversation about income inequality right now. I think that’s long overdue. There was a time where we operated with a general philosophy that workers should be able to afford the goods and services that they help to produce. That’s not some outdated notion. It’s fundamentally American.Many of you asked me why I made passing a $15 minimum wage an immediate priority given all the challenges our state faces right now.The current minimum wage is $8.25 an hour – which means even if you are working full time every week out of the year, you are making $17,000 a year. You can’t send your kids to college on $17,000 a year. You can’t afford a single health emergency, or pay for any of the things that might prevent a health emergency. You can’t sustain child care on $17,000 a year. And you can’t save for retirement. A flat tire or a worn car battery is a genuine fiscal emergency that might also threaten your job. And one paycheck is often the only firewall against homelessness.The current minimum wage is a lifetime sentence to poverty.Whether you live in Chicago or Cairo, I find that unacceptable, and I worked with the appropriate amount of haste to change it. When your house is burning down, you don’t wait for the rain to put out the fire.I said I would put Springfield back on the side of working families, and I meant it.Finally, we will do more to keep our neighbors safe in the state of Illinois. This begins with making sure the Illinois State Police can be rebuilt, with two new cadet classes to replenish their dwindling ranks. We will pay for the gun dealer licensing law that I was proud to sign during my first week in office, to take a reasonable step to end the scourge of gun violence in too many of our neighborhoods. We will take a more rigorous approach to getting guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them in the first place. I’m committed to advocating for commonsense gun laws, and I’m committed to making sure that we are implementing the laws we already have on the books more effectively. These investments have taken on an even greater importance since the massacre in Aurora, which serves as a poignant and painful reminder of the work that still remains.Every governor deals with their share of trials, tumult and tribulation.I mentioned at the beginning of this speech that Henry Horner took office in 1933 at the start of the worst decade of economic decline in US history.Horner was good friends with Carl Sandburg. They shared a love of all things related to President Lincoln. In the later years of his life, Sandburg granted an interview about his friend Governor Horner, in which he said, “Horner was the real goods…he got to high places without selling his soul.”Indeed, despite all the economic struggles the state faced during the Great Depression, Horner still managed to increase school funding, institute unemployment insurance and pensions for older Illinoisans, create building programs for state institutions and improve public health services.He understood that prosperity doesn’t trickle down…it trickles up. When we lift up those who have the least, our boats all rise together.Horner was a fundamentally optimistic man. He approached his job as governor with a hopeful heart, and he never let that hope diminish under the uncommon burdens of being head of state.He knew what I know…that the state of our state has always been strong because of the values of our people…not the value of our coffers.Horner once said: “The only way to carry out any great purpose is not on your shoulders, but in your heart. Carry it on your backs and it may wear you down. Carry it in your hearts and it will lift you up. Thus, the heart strengthens the purpose, and the purpose gives poise and inspiration to the will.”Like you, I carry the burdens of this state in my heart – and despite the heavy load it lifts me up every day. I share my purpose with you so that it may give poise and inspiration to our collective will – because I know the road ahead is hard, but I think it’s about time we all walk it together.Thank you.Subscribe to our breaking news mailing listDarvish turning corner; Maddon mulling DH optionsLeslie Alarcon-Arajuo, 14, has been missing from Back of the Yards since Saturday.

This makes little sense. The UK should follow the lead of several other countries, which have ditched their low denomination coins, including Ireland, Canada, Australia and Sweden, among others. They serve little purpose in the economy today, are wasteful, and it’s hard to see how small businesses and charities could not adapt to a world without them.The British public’s reticence to scrap its copper coins is tied to a number of reasons. The majority of these are sentimental and link the penny to “British values”. But, when it comes to playing their role as money, the coins have lost their value.Money serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account. Originally money was minted from precious metals, like gold and silver. With time, precious metals were replaced by other metal blends, and the intrinsic value of coins diminished. When the penny was introduced as a unit of currency in the UK in 1971, a pint of milk cost 5p. Today, average prices have gone up significantly. Nowadays pennies are worth virtually nothing (even penny sweets cost more than a penny now) and can serve only as a unit of account.One of the biggest groups to complain about the loss of pennies has been small charities. They say they get huge amounts in donations from them. But if charities are to survive, they must explore alternative and innovative ways of fundraising. Similarly, small businesses must offer electronic payments to their customers to stay competitive. Good business is all about efficiency and competition at the end of the day. Also, those people who want to donate to charity will keep donating using other coins. Similarly, those who prefer card payments would carry less cash to donate in their wallets regardless.Digital payments, for their short period of existence, are already responsible for more than half of all payments in the UK. Contactless payments have pushed this trend even further. Getting rid of 1p and 2p coins is just a natural response to this trend – and it will save tax payers money. The Royal Mint, which produces the country’s coins, does not release details of the cost of minting pennies. They were mostly made of copper until 1992, which would have made them cost more to make than their monetary value. Now they are made from a copper-plated steel. Figures for the US show that a one-cent piece cost the US Mint 1.5 cents to produce in 2016 (but these are made from copper-plated zinc).So it’s hard to say if pennies cost the taxpayer in this sense. But a big issue with pennies is the fact that nobody really spends them. Despite claims that the penny is a valued part of British culture, literature and history, statistics show little love for these coins. Around 8% of coppers are thrown in the bin every year. According to the Royal Mint, there are 11,430m 1p coins (worth £114.29m) and 6,714 2p coins (worth £134.273m) in circulation so 8% would lead to substantial waste.

21,Drinking Age - Lower It,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered from 21 to a Younger Age?,1s21q8r,http://www.teenink.com/opinion/drugs_alcohol_smoking/article/806875/Should-the-Drinking-Age-Be-Lowered/,Should the Drinking Age Be Lowered? | Teen Ink,"Please enter the email address that you use to login to TeenInk.com, and we'll email you instructions to reset your password. The minimum legal drinking age should not be lowered to 18. Even at 21 the brain isn’t fully developed, so lowering the drinking age to 18 would be dangerous and medically irresponsible. There would be an increase in binge drinking due to a lack of impulse control in those whose brains aren’t fully developed. There would also be more unsafe and illegal drinking activity, as well as more fatal accidents and dangerous behavior caused by being intoxicated.  Lowering the minimum legal drinking age would be medically irresponsible. The brain is not fully developed until the age of 25, and even then some people’s brains develop slower and aren’t fully developed until the early 30’s. Alcohol has an extremely dangerous effect on the brain that can be even more dangerous if the brain is not fully developed. Researchers at Duke University Medical Center and Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center studied the effects of alcohol on young adults ranging from 21 to 30 years old. They found that alcohol impaired learning and memory in the younger adults more than the older ones. Alcohol affects the parts of the brain that control thought processing, consciousness, movement, balance, hormones, and automatic brain functions such as breathing. This is why it is unsafe to drive after drinking. Alcohol affects how quickly a person can react and how well a person can function. A study in 2002 showed that MLDA 21 produced fewer traffic accidents. 98% of the analyses show that a higher drinking age results in less fatal accidents caused to drunk driving. With MLDA 18, people would be able to legally drink at an age where impulse control isn’t at its best. This means that that younger people drinking are more likely to drink more than they should and build up their tolerance to alcohol. The more they drink, the more tolerant they will become. Then they will need to continue to consume more and more amounts of alcohol to produce the same feeling of intoxication. Tolerance leads to heavy drinking which can eventually lead to alcohol-dependence or alcoholism. MLDA 18 would evidently increase the amount of binge drinking and alcohol abuse. Also, if 18-yer-olds are allowed to buy alcohol, then it would be easier for teenagers to get their hands on alcohol because they could just have their friends or family members of legal age buy it for them. This would increase illegal and unsafe drinking activity. “Consuming alcohol has proved to make males more virile and females more sexually attractive.” This affect can lead to risky or criminal sexual activity such as unprotected sex or rape. Teens who average five or more drinks daily are three times less likely to use a condom, and 16% of teens who drink use a condom less often after having consumed alcohol. Alcohol use is implicated in two-thirds of sexual assault and date rape cases among teens and college students. Some may argue that lowering the drinking age and allowing 18 to 20-year olds to buy alcohol would benefit the economy by increasing revenue of private business and increasing the amount of tax revenue collected by the government. However, MLDA 18 would create an easier way for underage drinkers to get alcohol. Every year, middle school and high school students drink 1.1 million cans of beer and 35% of all wine coolers sold in America. Two-thirds of those teens say they are able to buy their own alcohol. If that many teens are able to get alcohol with MLDA 21, then just imagine how many more teens would be able to get alcohol with MLDA 18. It would also allow 18 to 20-year-olds to go to bars and nightclubs which are unsafe environments. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, approximately 15,000 Americans are treated each year for intentional poisoning. The typical victims are at nightclubs and bars where they are drugged then raped, assaulted, or robbed. In 60% of those cases, the people involved had been consuming alcohol. Studies have also shown that 58-85% of bar sales were illegal “sales to obviously intoxicated patrons”. This proves that bars and nightclubs aren’t the “safe, regulated environments” most people assume they are. There are a lot of risks that come with drinking in these environments that should not be available for 18 to 20-year-olds. Others may say that since 18 is the age of adulthood, 18-year-olds should be given the right to choose to drink just like they can choose to vote or join the army. Although this is true that 18 is the age adulthood, it is not a constitutional right to drink at 18, so; therefore, they do not have a choice in that matter. Also, the age should be kept at 21 due to the dangers of drinking. The NIAAA has made it a priority for future research to focus on studying alcoholism and trying to find a cure for it. Until then, it would be in the best interest of America to keep MLDA 21 to keep the risk of young adults becoming alcoholics to a minimum and reduce the dangers of underage drinking. I personally do not have a want or need to consume alcohol until of legal age, and hopefully I can influence other teenagers to do the same. Those under 21 need to understand and be aware of the dangers and long-term effects of drinking, especially before the brain is fully developed. I feel there should be more awareness raised in school. Schools have health classes and awareness weeks, but the dangers and risks of consuming alcohol should be enforced more than just one week of the year or one unit of a class. The younger the age alcohol is consumed, the higher the risk and dangers of consuming it. MLDA 21 will help to keep America safer. MLDA 18 has too many risks and should not be considered a responsible drinking age. My Honors English class had an assignment to research and write an argumentative essay on a controversial topic. I chose to do mine on the drinking age because I feel it is important for teens to see that it is unsafe to drink before they are 21.Favorite Quote:""It is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams."" - Pres.

41,Gay Marriage,Should Gay Marriage Be Legal?,1s41q5r,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-davis-legal-fees-gay-marriage-kentucky-governor_us_5c5225a5e4b0ca92c6dd07d8,"Kim Davis Must Pay Legal Fees After Same-Sex Marriage Battle, Kentucky Governor Says | HuffPost","FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — As a candidate for governor in 2015, Matt Bevin said he “absolutely supported” a Kentucky county clerk who stopped issuing marriage licenses because of her opposition to gay marriage.But four years later, after a court ordered Kentucky taxpayers to pay more than $222,000 in legal fees for the gay and straight couples who sued, outside lawyers for now Gov. Bevin say former Rowan County clerk Kim Davis broke the law and taxpayers “should not have to collectively bear the financial responsibility for Davis’ intransigence.”“Only Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took,” Bevin attorney Palmer G. Vance II wrote in a brief filed with the court.Bevin has been a staunch supporter of Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized gay marriage.

But if they do, they disagree on who should pay. Davis’ attorneys argue she acted on behalf of the state.But in an interview with The Associated Press, Davis’ attorney Mat Staver said he does not attribute those arguments to Bevin, but to the attorneys who represents him. Those attorneys, Palmer G. Vance II and William M. Lear Jr., are the same ones who represented former Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear on the case before Bevin took office.″(Bevin) led the charge on that religious liberty accommodation, which is what we asked for from the very beginning,” Staver said.Bevin’s in-house attorney, Steve Pitt, also noted the lawyers were hired by Beshear, and said they “have taken no position as to whether Ms. Davis acted unconstitutionally.”“Governor Bevin does not believe that she has done so and continues to support Ms. Davis’s actions,” Pitt said. “Our outside counsel have only argued, given the court’s ruling, that if constitutional rights were violated, the taxpayers of Kentucky are not responsible to pay the ACLU’s attorney fees.”Vance and Lear did not return a phone call seeking comment.The case dates to the summer of 2015 when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide. At the time, the county clerk’s name appeared on all marriage licenses in Kentucky.

The case was resolved when the state legislature passed a law removing the names of county clerks from Kentucky marriage licenses.In 2017, a federal judge ruled that Davis was acting as an agent for the state, making Kentucky taxpayers responsible for paying the legal fees of the gay and straight couples who filed suit. Bevin objected. His lawyers argue no one should have to pay the legal fees, because the gay and straight couples did not technically win the lawsuit since it was dismissed.However, Bevin’s lawyers also argued if legal fees are awarded, either Rowan County or Davis herself should be responsible to pay them. Bevin’s lawyer Palmer Vance II, noted the purpose of requiring losers to pay for attorneys’ fees is to deter “conduct that violates civil rights.”“That purpose is not vindicated if the offending office_the Rowan County Clerk’s Office_suffers no liability,” Vance wrote. “Indeed, there is little to deter the Rowan County Clerk’s Office from developing policies that violate the Kentucky or United States Constitutions.”Jeffrey C. Mando, an attorney for Rowan County, dismissed that argument. He said clerks are elected officials and not county employees. He also added that “all procedures relating to marriage licenses are governed solely by the state.” He said that’s why former Democratic Gov.

While they might be more suited for vegans or people who are intolerant or allergic to milk, there are some specific nutritional benefits such as fat, protein, sugar and micro nutrients like calcium and vitamin D that can only be found in milk and cannot be mimicked, according to researchers.Some people consider that milk should be drank only by babies, and that we shouldn’t drink cow milk due to the fact that it is made by cows to feed their young. However, humans have been drinking it for thousands of years now, and even though several modern options are available, it doesn’t seem like we will be stopping anytime soon.It is true that in some parts of the world drinking milk is more popular than in others, that is because it mainly started becoming a habit for early farmers and pastoralists in western Europe that lived with domesticated animals, including cows. That is why today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, North America, and a patchwork of other places. While in other places, like China, it had just recently become more popular. Back in 2000, there was a nationwide campaign in China that encouraged people to consume more milk and dairy products for health reasons.Milk contains lactose, which is a type of sugar different from the one found in fruit and other sweet foods. Our bodies make an enzyme called lactase that helps us digest the lactose in milk, it happens when we are babies but after we are weaned in early childhood, for many people it stops, that is why without lactase we cannot properly digest the lactose in milk. Thus many people are lactose intolerant and after drinking milk they can experience bloating, flatulence, cramps, or even diarrhea.However, along the years of evolution, some people began keeping their lactase enzymes active into adulthood. It started happening in southern Europe about 5,000 years ago, and later in central Europe around 3,000 years ago. This is called lactase persistence and allows them to drink milk without side effects, being the result of mutations in a section of DNA that controls the activity of the lactase gene. This is nowadays quite common in northern Europe and for a few populations in Africa and the Middle East. Meanwhile, it is quite uncommon in Asia and South America, as well as for most Africans.Lactase-non-persistent people can still drink milk in small amounts, as well as consume butter, yogurt, cream or cheese, since they have a smaller amount of lactose due to being processed. History shows that people have actually been making and eating cheese longer than they have been drinking milk. In Europe people were making cheese since 6-7,000 years ago, this is well before lactase persistence became common in Europeans.Nevertheless, milk still remains the first-go-to solution for most people. All the advertising and modern vibes that alternative milks bring will not make much of a dent in the world’s appetite for milk, at least over the next decade. Moreover, specialists pointed in a new planetary health diet meant to maximize health and minimize our impact on the environment, that while we should cut down on meat and other animal products, one glass of milk per day is still recommended.Source: bbc.com",2,3,Pro,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Pro', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Is Drinking Milk Healthy for Humans?

Furthermore, in 1962, the Soviet Union built a nuclear missile base in Cuba, against which the United States blocked Cuba's sea and the Cuban crisis where tension increased until the full nuclear warfare occurred. When Castro took measures to ease the departure of Cuban citizens in 1980, 125 thousand Cubans migrated to Florida in the United States at the same time, who had an antipathy with the Castro regime. Nobody noticed at the time, but this mass migrant will give rise to new fires. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, President Clinton ceased to consider Cuba as a threat, tried to cancel embargo measures and restore diplomatic relations. The Castro regime, which had fallen into a severe economic situation because of losing the Soviet Union, which had been the backing point, tried to agree with this.

Because TNT still apparently knows its formula for drama.Sporting a Lakers logo across his chest for the first time in this exercise, LeBron James took the court with the teammates he had picked during a televised draft. He got to dress them in black. Then, he demanded they not play defense, just defend his honor and consider joining him in L.A. ASAP.It all made for wonderful window dressing during a Sunday night presentation for February TV sweeps.“The NBA game in general is getting overlooked by speculation and everything,” Team LeBron member Kevin Durant said during the weekend’s festivities in Charlotte, N.C. “It’s the soap opera, and we’re all actors just trying to play our roles.”At least Durant acknowledged as much as one of the latest media moguls running a full-court press of brand awareness.The NBA All-Star game, when it’s not in L.A., often can go sideways, which usually forces the broadcasting crew to laugh along with the antics.If you weren’t into the TNT feed, aside from Marv Albert’s miscalls with Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, there was a more unserviceable TBS offering of a “Players Only” branded feed with Greg Anthony trying to post up on Charles Barkley and Kevin Garnett.Then there was a brief interlude to hear a Cosmote Sport feed with Greek broadcasters describing the exploits of Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Sports media: NBA All-Star game is as puffed up a piece of preening as Westminster Dog Show - Los Angeles Times In a post-Grammys/pre-Oscars prime-time TV slot, the NBA All-Star game embraces all the trappings of self-congratulatory excess.As much as we want to keep encouraging it, we’re doomed to soon reach a point of no returns.Aside from the puffed-up exhibition game, this was just the latest edition of the LeBron Choice Awards. Because TNT still apparently knows its formula for drama.Sporting a Lakers logo across his chest for the first time in this exercise, LeBron James took the court with the teammates he had picked during a televised draft. He got to dress them in black. Then, he demanded they not play defense, just defend his honor and consider joining him in L.A. ASAP.It all made for wonderful window dressing during a Sunday night presentation for February TV sweeps.“The NBA game in general is getting overlooked by speculation and everything,” Team LeBron member Kevin Durant said during the weekend’s festivities in Charlotte, N.C. “It’s the soap opera, and we’re all actors just trying to play our roles.”At least Durant acknowledged as much as one of the latest media moguls running a full-court press of brand awareness.The NBA All-Star game, when it’s not in L.A., often can go sideways, which usually forces the broadcasting crew to laugh along with the antics.If you weren’t into the TNT feed, aside from Marv Albert’s miscalls with Reggie Miller and Chris Webber, there was a more unserviceable TBS offering of a “Players Only” branded feed with Greg Anthony trying to post up on Charles Barkley and Kevin Garnett.Then there was a brief interlude to hear a Cosmote Sport feed with Greek broadcasters describing the exploits of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Honestly, we could have listened to that all night.Like the Grammys, the All-Star game had musical interludes (with necessary audio cuts).

J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed a bill that sets the state's minimum wage on a path to reach $15 per hour by 2025.Pritzker signed the bill into law Tuesday morning during a ceremony at the Governor's Mansion in Springfield, making Illinois among the first states to approve a minimum wage of $15 per hour, a goal set by the labor-backed Fight for $15 movement. California will hit that level in 2022, Massachusetts in 2023 and New Jersey in 2024. New York's minimum wage eventually will reach $15 per hour statewide through a series of increases tied to inflation.Illinois last increased its minimum wage, to $8.25 per hour, in 2010.""For nine long years, there were many forces that were arrayed against giving a raise to the people who work so hard to provide home care for seniors, child care for toddlers, who wash dishes at the diner, and who farm our fields,"" Pritzker said before signing the measure. ""Today is a victory for the cause of economic justice.""By signing the minimum wage increase into law before delivering his first budget proposal to lawmakers on Wednesday, Pritzker scored a major victory in the opening weeks of his term, fulfilling a campaign promise and demonstrating the power Democrats now wield in Springfield with control of the governor's office and the legislature. But Pritzker's first legislative victory came without a single Republican vote, highlighting the challenge he'll face making good on his promise to work with the minority party.An estimated 1.4 million Illinois residents currently make less than $15 an hour. Under the law, on Jan. 1 the statewide minimum wage increases from $8.25 to $9.25 per hour. The minimum wage again will increase to $10 per hour on July 1, 2020, and will then go up $1 per hour each year on Jan. 1 until hitting $15 per hour in 2025.Since Illinois last raised its minimum wage, Chicago has increased its minimum wage to $12 per hour, and Cook County's is now $11. The city and county minimums each will increase by $1 per hour July 1. The federal minimum wage remains $7.25 per hour.""It's been a long, long, long time coming,"" said Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, a Maywood Democrat who has sponsored numerous minimum wage bills, including the one signed Tuesday and another then-Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed in 2017. ""And so many people deserve the opportunity just to feel hope, to feel like they can go to work and come home and have dignity and pride and respect in what they do. This is our first step in giving them that opportunity.""While Democrats and their supporters in organized labor were celebrating the minimum wage victory, Republicans and business interests continued sounding warnings that rising wages will lead employers to cut workers' hours, eliminate jobs, invest in automation or close their doors. GOP lawmakers and business groups called for lower minimum wages in the collar counties outside Chicago and downstate to account for the lower cost of living in those areas.Businesses already are evaluating how a higher minimum wage will affect the bottom line and beginning to plan accordingly, said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, which led the push for a minimum wage that varies by region.""They have a limited ability to raise prices, so ... everything's going to be on the table,"" Karr said, including cutting employee benefits and jobs.In an attempt to ease the burden on employers, the law creates a tax credit to help businesses with 50 or fewer employees offset some of the cost of wage increases. Employers will be able to claim a tax credit for 25 percent of the cost in 2020, and the credit will scale back annually, then eventually phase out.The law also preserves the way restaurants and other employers with tipped workers count gratuities toward employees' wages, and it sets a lower minimum wage for workers younger than 18 who work fewer than 650 hours in a year. The minimum wage for younger employees -- currently $7.75 per hour -- would increase to $8 on Jan. 1 and peak at $13 per hour in 2025.Like most issues in Springfield, the state's troubled finances entered the minimum wage debate. State agencies and universities employ workers who earn minimum wage, and the state reimburses social service providers who care for the elderly and people with disabilities, among other services.

When politicians ban things not because they have a mandate from the voters but merely because of their personal preference, they have become tyrants – they are using their own views as a proxy for what the electorate wishes to happen, without asking them through the democratic mechanisms.And when they do this, it’s a big problem, because we know what happens when people are denied by legislation something that they really want – the practice goes underground.It’s the argument used by fans of pugilism to keep boxing legal, and its also the argument that underpins criticism of the War on Drugs – banning drugs has merely enriched criminals and endangered users.Oh, and it’s the argument that progressives use to keep abortion legal.We are told by progressives that if we ban abortion, it will put women’s lives at risk as they are forced to seek back-street abortions.But here we are being told that legal prostitution should be banned.Won’t that also cause women’s lives to be placed at risk, as prostitutes are forced to ply their trade on the black market rather than the free market?Forego the testing for sexually-transmitted diseases, the monitored environment, the regulated industry.

Even when that politicians uses the force of the State to punish those who do it.They simply takes their peccadilloes off Main Street and into the back streets.So just as the pro-choice lobby would tell us abortions must be kept legal to safeguard the lives of mothers, should not prostitution remain legal to safeguard the lives of prostitutes?Presumably Ms Halsema is not so stupid to believe that people will stop wanting to pay for sex just because she tells them she disapproves?

Brian Kemp proposed legislation to bolster Georgians’ access to health care through a bill that would give him the executive ability to partially expand Medicaid. Georgia Republicans have spearheaded the campaign to enact the Patients First Act, which gives low-income Georgians access to more affordable health care. The partial expansion is a step in the right direction to ensure the most vulnerable people in the state receive health care coverage. But the bill is a half-hearted attempt to solve the health care crisis and fails to take advantage of federal funds already set aside for state Medicaid programs.The proposal falls short in guaranteeing health care for Georgians who need it most. Georgia House Democrats unanimously oppose the bill for a reason: full Medicaid expansion is the smarter choice. Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate, has called the Republican proposal a “pale facsimile” of a plan which gives Kemp significant power in deciding how Medicaid will operate and who will ultimately benefit from the bill — a dangerous model considering Kemp strove to disenfranchise poor and minority voters to win the 2018 election. Without full Medicaid expansion, Georgia is also losing out on billions of dollars in potential federal funding and has to pay more money to cover fewer people; since Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010, the federal government will match state spending nine-to-one for states which have fully expanded Medicaid. Georgia is one of only 14 states in the country not taking advantage of that money, a result of fierce opposition by Georgia Republican lawmakers. The scope of the expansion is also limited by Kemp’s proposed waiver structure, which would prevent people who are slightly above the poverty line from receiving Medicaid. It would also allow people who use the Affordable Care Act exchange market to buy private health insurance, competition which can drive up prices for Medicaid. Kemp’s law departs from convention as it would only allow people who fall below the poverty line to receive benefits, while states that have fully expanded Medicaid allow anyone who falls within a margin of the poverty line to also receive benefits. Few would argue a person with an annual income of $13,000 — only slightly above the poverty line for adults under 65 — doesn’t deserve to be covered by Medicaid. This method also incentivizes people to fall below the line to receive benefits.Medicaid expansion is politically popular in Georgia, as 71 percent of registered Georgia voters polled by the University of Georgia said they supported expansion. But it’s questionable whether Kemp’s law would satisfy voters. The bill’s failure to expand Medicaid beyond the poverty line limits its ability to resolve Georgia’s rural health care crisis. In addition, the law is being proposed amid a national conversation that strongly favors more drastic overhauls to the American health care system. A staggering 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, Democrats and Independents support a single-payer “Medicare for all” system. Such a system would abolish private health insurance, which would be replaced by a single provider managed by the federal government and paid for by taxes. Kemp’s proposed Medicaid expansion would benefit some Georgians but would do little to alleviate wider frustrations for those who would still be required to purchase private insurance. America spends twice as much on health care than almost all other developed countries while achieving similar or worse health outcomes, according to a 2018 study from Harvard University (Mass.). Though we cannot expect that Kemp will jump on an Obamacare-esque bandwagon anytime soon, Americans are longing for more than Kemp’s partial Medicaid expansion.Although Kemp and Georgia House Republicans have offered a serviceable proposal to partially expand Medicaid in the state, they should follow the lead of the 36 states which have already fully expanded Medicaid.The Editorial Board is composed of Zach Ball, Jacob Busch, Ryan Fan, Andrew Kliewer, Madeline Lutwyche, Boris Niyonzima, Omar Obregon-Cuebas, Shreya Pabbaraju, Isaiah Sirois, Madison Stephens and Kimia Tabatabaei.

For any burgeoning high school graduate there is a key phrase that either your guidance counselor or the news has well acquainted you with: global economy.We live in an interconnected and interdependent world, where securing a good, well-paying job, first requires securing a college degree. As outlined in the Washington Post, in the early 1980s, the recession eliminated the manufacturing sector as a place of employment for people with only a high school diploma.This, in turn, rapidly widened the wage premium for a college degree, or how much more the average bachelor’s degree recipient earns compared to a high school graduate. In 1983, the wage premium was 42 percent.Today, it is more than 80 percent. In real world terms, according to a Georgetown University study, college graduates earn $1 million more in lifetime earnings than high school graduates. The Brookings Institute noted in a paper, in accordance with Franklin, that a college education is one of the best investments a student can make, with an annual return on investment between 10 to 20 percent.However, while a college degree used to be viewed as a golden ticket to a life of leisure, today the bachelor’s degree is merely an entry ticket, replacing a high school diploma. A report by Burning Glass, a company that analyzes data within job advertisements, discovered that 65 percent of postings for secretaries and assistants mandate a bachelor’s degree, when only 19 percent of those currently employed in similar positions have one. This statistic proves the necessity of a college degree in this new economy.The fact is that during an economic downturn, like the one 10 years ago, people who have more education take jobs away from people who have less education, especially managerial and/or executive positions. Of course, I must address the outrageous cost of college education in the United States, which is a deterrent for many individuals. The cost of tuition in Europe can range from free to maybe $2,000, while tuition in the United States is anywhere from $10,000 to above $50,000.This is why student loan debt has outpaced credit card debt, and the reason why choosing a pragmatic major is important. US News considers a “pragmatic” major one where the starting salary is above $40,000 to overcome a $100,000 bill and still comfortably earn more than the average high school graduate. But, as US News pointed out, exploring ways to lower costs, such as scholarships, a state school or taking AP classes will make any degree a sound investment.Still, there is a $3.4 million difference in lifetime earnings between the highest and lowest paying college majors, with STEM graduates earning significantly more than those that graduated with a humanities degree.Overall, though, no degree guarantees greater wealth, but some are riskier than others. The “safest” majors per US News and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, are actuarial science, dental hygiene, economics, engineering, information technology, human resources, and math, while the majors with the least earning potential are social work, elementary teachers, drama and theater arts, family and consumer studies, and anthropology and archaeology.Furthermore, vocational careers like welders and electricians have the ability to make upwards of $40,000 a year, but they still require a post-secondary training program and/or an associate’s degree, which costs money.There are a host of arguments that can be utilized in favor of college education, including the betterment of our society with informed citizens and voters, but I believe the spirit of this question lies in the numbers. Luckily, for my opinion at least, the numbers overwhelmingly support the idea that college is a wise investment and has not outpriced its worth.It’s no secret that over the course of the past 40 years, almost everything available for purchase has dramatically increased in cost.College is no exception. Unfortunately, the inflated cost of college tuition has become so high that it has now overpriced its value.According to Forbes, the average college graduate has $37,172 of student loan debt which will take roughly 10 years to repay.This doesn’t sound like much unless you factor in the career the student chooses to pursue.If a student decides to enter a field whose starting salary is well below the $50,000 average starting salary of college graduates, this debt represents a much larger percentage of the individual’s lifetime pay.

OpinionGender, Homosexuality, Politics - U.S.Mon Feb 18, 2019 - 5:59 pm EST colorado, education, homosexuality, lgbt tyranny, new jersey, phil murphy, propaganda, transgenderismFebruary 18, 2019 (LifeSiteNews) — The door is now wide open in many public schools for corrupting teachers to enter and poison the minds and bodies of impressionable children.Most teachers try to do what's right, but with so-called ""non-discrimination"" school policies in place, sexually immoral adults and pro-abortion/""LGBTQ"" activists cannot be barred from classroom access to children.And now in New Jersey, it's easier than ever, since ""gay"" indoctrination just became a state requirement. Beginning in the 2020 school year, N.J. schools must teach that homosexuality and gender confusion are wonderful and normal behaviors with a legacy of  brave heroes.This will be, of course, a bald-faced lie.The timing is ironic. Just two weeks before this deviance-mandate bill was signed by New Jersey's Democrat governor, Mission America received a distraught email from a mother in north central New Jersey. She contacted us after reading articles on our website and provided infuriating details about her son's private corruption by a teacher allied with GLSEN, the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.Here's what she wrote:I want to share my story about how this messed up my son and how I pulled him out. We live in [an area] in New Jersey where most families are traditional ... It was just few months ago. I found out as I saw the book Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe in his backpack and he told me the teacher was teaching about gender stereotypes. It was around November 2018, I said OK to this as this was a school writing project.Soon I found changed behavior in my son and his friends. Around 16 kids and one of the teachers had already influenced them to start  an LGBTQ  Instagram group without the knowledge or consent or any of the parents! Fortunately,  I saw some of the posts when my son left his computer on ... and these kids were online posting mature LGBT content jokes and videos. I strongly objected and took it up with the school.The mom went on to explain that the teacher kept a selection of pro-homosexual books in her classroom, which she encouraged the middle schoolers to read:If I had not seen the effects of this propaganda on my own 13- year -old son and his friends, I would never have believed that any propaganda can influence perfectly straight boys. My son who has never questioned his gender and identified completely as a young boy suddenly started talking about gender fluidity and wanting to wear more androgynous clothing. It was only when I saw his Language Arts teacher — an active GLSEN ally — and her notes to him where she is selling this fluidity to very young minds under the pretext of preventing them from 'bullying.'So how is her son doing now? The mom reported that ""by God's grace"" she was able to convince her son to leave these influences behind, but ""it took a lot of time, effort and loving guidance."" She added, ""I faced a wall initially as school authorities have already brainwashed these kids against their 'gender conforming' parents who are mainly 'responsible' for depression and suicide among LGBTQ youth. Gender expression is presented as a civil right.""And this happened before New Jersey mandated ""gay"" propaganda. The new law makes it easier for activist teachers and administrators to breach boundaries while advocating perversion to kids.Colorado also has a compulsory ""LGBT"" school bill on the table. It would require homosexual-friendly sexuality education. In Illinois, lawmakers attempted last session to pass what would have been the most radical bill in the nation, mandating ""LGBTQ"" lessons beginning as early as kindergarten. Now in 2019, a reintroduced bill recommends the same sweeping, immoral indoctrination.California passed the first such bill in the country, with curricula honoring the most extreme perversion and shutting out opposing views as ""hate.""Such tactics are not about ""social justice,"" but about high-risk social engineering experiments using children, often without parental knowledge or consent.And we can all expect even more extreme lessons as spring unfolds. After all, this is the season of the annual GLSEN ""Day of Silence (DOS),"" this year on April 12.Are elementary schools beginning to observe DOS, a contrived ""LGBTQ"" propaganda event using ""anti-bullying"" as a Trojan horse? It seems that some are.In California last year, a ""diversity week"" was planned at Betsy Ross Elementary School (Anaheim) to occur in late April, suspiciously timed to possibly correspond with the 2018 ""Day of Silence"" observed in many middle and high schools.But there's good news. Brave and outspoken parents affiliated with MassResistance strongly objected to the planned indoctrination. Extremist GLSEN materials and even Human Rights Campaign's outrageous ""Welcoming Schools"" program were the focus of teacher training. But the ""diversity week"" was scrubbed, praise God, because of push-back by concerned parents led by a social worker mom who blew the lid off the plans.California's ""FAIR Education Act"" has enabled radical homosexual and gender confusion lessons throughout the state's classrooms. And the California ""Healthy Youth Act"" in 2015 mandated ""inclusive"" sex education. Parents are just now understanding what ""FAIR""  and ""inclusive"" mean in gay-speak. These lessons distort what they call ""LGBT history,"" morphing known sexual predators like Harvey Milk and other deviant activists in this movement into heroes.And sex ed with homosexual values is all about ""safe"" anal sex, condom use,  normalizing hook-ups, and confusing kids about their own biological sex. The good news is that parents all over the state are objecting to the ""Healthy Youth Act"" and its hazardous messages, as well as the FAIR Act.In many schools, parents are prevented from knowing about a son's or daughter's experimental gender ""fluidity."" Schools are becoming allies with sin and corruption, often keeping parents in the dark about life-threatening behavior.As these new laws roll out, students are conned and put at risk by a phony, positive spin on homosexuality and gender rebellion.

30,Net Neutrality,Should Net Neutrality Be Restored?,1s30q8r,https://wtop.com/national/2019/02/tech-firms-states-face-feds-in-net-neutrality-court-battle/,"Tech companies, states spar with govt over net neutrality | WTOP","WASHINGTON (AP) — Tech companies and nearly two dozen U.S. states clashed with the government in federal court Friday over the repeal of net neutrality, a set of Obama-era rules aimed at preventing big internet providers from discriminating against certain technology and services.Judges challenged arguments made by both sides in the faceoff in an appeals court in Washington.Lawyers for the states and the companies tried to persuade the three-judge panel to restore the net neutrality regime, set in 2015 during the Obama administration and repealed in December 2017 at the direction of a regulator appointed by President Donald Trump. The companies challenging the FCC action include Mozilla, developer of the Firefox web browser, and Vimeo, a video-sharing site.The net neutrality rules had banned cable, wireless and other broadband providers from blocking or slowing down websites and apps of their choosing, or charging Netflix and other video services extra to reach viewers faster.The practice of slowing down transmission is known as “throttling.”The action by the Federal Communications Commission rolling back the neutrality rules “is a stab in the heart of the Communications Act,” said attorney Pantelis Michalopoulos, referring to the Depression-era law that established the FCC.The FCC wrongly classified the internet as an information service rather than a telecoms service, using that as a rationale for not cracking down on misconduct by big internet providers, Michalopoulos said, who represents Mozilla and the other companies in the case.Government lawyers, as well as big internet providers such as AT&T, Verizon and Comcast, argued to keep net neutrality repealed.Thomas Johnson, the FCC’s general counsel, said the agency’s “light-touch” regulatory scheme, requiring the internet providers to disclose their practices and operations, provides adequate safeguards. The internet — used more extensively to transmit information — is different both in nature and function from phone service, Johnson maintained. It therefore should be regulated as an information service and not subject to the utility-style oversight of phone companies, he said.The politically charged issue has emerged from its origins as an engineering challenge to become an anti-monopoly rallying point and even a focus for “resistance” to the Trump administration.Once Trump took office, net neutrality became one of his first targets as part of broader government deregulation. The FCC chairman he appointed, Ajit Pai, made rolling back net neutrality a top priority.On the other side, support for net neutrality comes from many of the same people who also are critical of the data-vacuuming tech giants that benefit from it. Politicians have glommed on to the cause to appear consumer-friendly.The Democratic takeover of the House in November’s midterm elections could revive efforts to enshrine net neutrality in federal law, though Trump likely would veto any such attempts.At the hearing in the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Stephen Williams questioned Michalopoulos’s assertions on the FCC wrongly classifying the internet as an information service. Telephone services, too, offer an array of customer products, he said. On the question of broadband providers charging premiums for faster service, Williams said a large majority of consumers prefer cheaper, lower-speed options, citing polls.The judges are weighing whether the FCC had the authority to nix the 2015 rules and get out of the business of enforcing net neutrality. It appeared that Williams was sympathetic to the FCC’s arguments, while Judge Patricia Millett raised possible legal avenues for the companies and states suing the agency, and Judge Robert Wilkins was the swing vote, said Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank.The judges could decide to can the repeal or send it back to the FCC for a redo if they have specific objections.“Today we fought for an open and free internet that puts consumers first, Mozilla Chief Operating Officer Denelle Dixon said after the hearing. “We believe the FCC needs to follow the rules like everyone else.”Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

The companies challenging the FCC action include Mozilla, developer of the Firefox web browser, and Vimeo, a video-sharing site.The net neutrality rules had banned cable, wireless and other broadband providers from blocking or slowing down websites and apps of their choosing, or charging Netflix and other video services extra to reach viewers faster.The practice of slowing down transmission is known as “throttling.”The action by the Federal Communications Commission rolling back the neutrality rules “is a stab in the heart of the Communications Act,” said attorney Pantelis Michalopoulos, referring to the Depression-era law that established the FCC.The FCC wrongly classified the internet as an information service rather than a telecoms service, using that as a rationale for not cracking down on misconduct by big internet providers, Michalopoulos said, who represents Mozilla and the other companies in the case.Government lawyers, as well as big internet providers such as AT&T, Verizon and Comcast, argued to keep net neutrality repealed.Thomas Johnson, the FCC’s general counsel, said the agency’s “light-touch” regulatory scheme, requiring the internet providers to disclose their practices and operations, provides adequate safeguards. The internet — used more extensively to transmit information — is different both in nature and function from phone service, Johnson maintained. It therefore should be regulated as an information service and not subject to the utility-style oversight of phone companies, he said.The politically charged issue has emerged from its origins as an engineering challenge to become an anti-monopoly rallying point and even a focus for “resistance” to the Trump administration.Once Trump took office, net neutrality became one of his first targets as part of broader government deregulation. The FCC chairman he appointed, Ajit Pai, made rolling back net neutrality a top priority.On the other side, support for net neutrality comes from many of the same people who also are critical of the data-vacuuming tech giants that benefit from it. Politicians have glommed on to the cause to appear consumer-friendly.The Democratic takeover of the House in November’s midterm elections could revive efforts to enshrine net neutrality in federal law, though Trump likely would veto any such attempts.At the hearing in the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Stephen Williams questioned Michalopoulos’s assertions on the FCC wrongly classifying the internet as an information service. Telephone services, too, offer an array of customer products, he said. On the question of broadband providers charging premiums for faster service, Williams said a large majority of consumers prefer cheaper, lower-speed options, citing polls.The judges are weighing whether the FCC had the authority to nix the 2015 rules and get out of the business of enforcing net neutrality. It appeared that Williams was sympathetic to the FCC’s arguments, while Judge Patricia Millett raised possible legal avenues for the companies and states suing the agency, and Judge Robert Wilkins was the swing vote, said Doug Brake, director of broadband and spectrum policy for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank.The judges could decide to can the repeal or send it back to the FCC for a redo if they have specific objections.“Today we fought for an open and free internet that puts consumers first, Mozilla Chief Operating Officer Denelle Dixon said after the hearing. “We believe the FCC needs to follow the rules like everyone else.”Copyright © 2019 The Associated Press.

Lol, no.","When John Dewey wrote Democracy and Education in 1916, he was responding, in part, to the popular Rousseauian ideal of a return to nature as a prescription for education reform. Dewey felt this was incomplete, pointing out that “to leave everything to nature was, after all, [] to negate the very idea of education; it was to trust the accidents of circumstance” for our conjoined living experiment we know as democracy. In the post-industrial, internet age, we are in a similar pickle with regard to the impact of technology on democracy: Tech entrepreneurs with outsized influence would have us trust the natural effects of the internet on democratization as a step towards utopia. We must disabuse ourselves, however, of the idea that our social media deities have any authentic desire to change the world for the better in lieu of lining their own pockets; they are far from countercultural actors. Ignoring these more contemporary accidents of circumstance that are emerging from a laissez-faire approach to direct democracy have devastating, border-spanning consequences.Counterculturalism, by definition, challenges the status quo, and the current economic structure of the internet — directed by their primary influencers as a neoliberal project—has failed to produce social transformation. The explicit acceptance of toxic behavior as protected by a libertarian ideal of free expression is a project of profit maximization, not societal progress. It’s not connecting people so much as it is ensuring their isolation. While the counter-cultural revolution of the 1960’s — from which Silicon Valley emerged — carried forth challenges to the industrial production model with heterarchical order and commons-based production¹ (as well as some sexual and psychedelic experimentation), a far more sweeping, capitalist ethos obstructed societal progress in the decades that followed. By the internet age, an emphasis on valorizing markets and profits ensured the strict adherence to “a project to strengthen… the power of economic elites”² instead of bringing diverse voices and rational civil discourse into the public sphere as theorized by Habermas (1989). After all, the post-industrial, so-called counter-cultural revolution of the 1960s itself was terrain explored almost exclusively by white, upper-middle class “pioneers” who did far more to invade upon and benefit from communities of color than they did to elevate them.In the decades that followed, these “countercultural” practitioners who became Silicon Valley’s elite have refused to move the needle on gender equality, racial integration, or inequality because they know it affects the bottom line. This is not to say that technology could have a role in combating these issues now or in the future, but without intervention for the sake of the public interest, the profits of the few will continue to be funded with the social cost of the many.Carmen Hermosillo, better known by her online handle “humdog”, was an early observer and theorist of our societal echoes in cyberspace. Her standpoint³ as a queer woman of color — in a space dominated by white, cisgendered men who extratextually identified her as male — gave her unique perspective with which to understand the emerging social space she inhabited.With a better perspective on what was emerging, she wrote presciently on the internet before the turn of the century. In her most famous piece, pandora’s vox: on community in cyberspace, she noticed that “so-called electronic communities encourage participation in fragmented, mostly silent, microgroups who are primarily engaged in dialogues of self-congratulation. in other words, most people lurk; and the ones who post, are pleased with themselves.” While cloistering can have counter-hegemonic benefits for marginalized groups⁴, groups she was able to find for herself, the phenomenon occurs just as easily in spaces interested in preserving the status quo; there are two-tails to the distribution. And because of their fragmented, masturbatory nature, it breeds antagonistic contact between opposing groups as opposed to a liberating and diverse public sphere predicted by some academics⁵.Many misogynistic and racist spaces emerge and reside in dark (and sometimes not so dark) corners of the internet such as 4chan or deep sub-Reddit pages, where the historically-grounded, classically-liberal stance towards individual expression undergirds discourse and, by extension, the economic engine of the internet. The affordances of internet technology allow for safer, counter-hegemonic spaces for #BlackLivesMatter but also coalitions of Nazis. The affordances of anonymity, too, are a double-edged sword: Where it on one hand can protect individuals from targeted harassment, on the other it allows individuals to perform targeted harassment without accountability. At scale, this same bifurcated, “natural” result can shape governments and swing elections, which in turn, shape the affordances.And these affordances are no accident. They are part and parcel of how expression is commodified on the internet. These social interactions do not happen in a vacuum but exist in a myriad of private, online spaces that accrue significant capital for companies that provide access with physical hardware, surreptitiously harvest personal data from user input for advertising⁶, or both. Humdog, still our guide, points out thatThe tech platforms have little desire to draw attention to themselves or become entangled with the communities themselves, whose actions they tacitly approve by eschewing accountability. While Twitter, Facebook and others might point to the inclusion of historically excluded voices or revolutionary activism under oppressive regimes, they remain culpable for the preservation of the status quo by adhering to the convenience of being a platform — a key legal category — and not a content provider like any media company that would otherwise have to regulate content to avoid liability. In the US, the privileged status as a platform comes from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. It gives tech companies broad legal immunity from the content their users post on their platforms.This has been the de facto protection that companies have employed and continue to employ, not just from Facebook and Twitter. Small-scale chat app Yik Yak has refused to police anonymous harassment on college campuses. Retail giant Amazon refuses to be responsible for dangerous products or misleading reviews on their site.A catastrophic recent example was how Twitter-alternative Gab provided a venue for the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter to develop a murderous, anti-Semitic ideology that resulted in the shooting of nearly a dozen Jews in their place of worship. Platforms are incentivized to avoid confronting these issues to keep users on their base for advertising or subscription, and the primary victims are going to be already marginalized groups.Google engineer James D’amore, apparently upset by sensitivity training he had to participate in, penned a 10-page, misogynistic manifesto entitled “Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber” that argued women are inferior engineers to men because they are excessively neurotic. He circulated it among his fellow employees on an internal message service and was quickly fired for what are odious, incorrect, and archaic views of gender. His piece cites studies whose authors come forward and explain he misrepresented or misinterpreted their findings and D’amore even links the Wikipedia page for neuroticism as evidence. He was fired.Fellow Google engineer Yonatan Zunger, who departed the company shortly after this event for different reasons, wrote in his blog to D’amore, justifying his firing by pointing out that heThe popular reaction, however, was categorical in almost the complete opposite respect. Both right-wing and left-wing publications centered the issue around the question of censorship, as opposed to misogyny, as if the issue somehow wasn’t settled science or broadly understood.The irony of the historical record is that the very word “computer” was originally coined for the hundreds of women who did ballistic missile calculations and perform programming operations on ENIAC, America’s first electronic computer. Jennifer Light’s 1999 piece, When Computers Were Women, points out that the machine would ultimatelyThe D’amore event demonstrated how the cultural effect would emerge from the economic values of the internet and move into real life; the popular reaction mirrored the libertarian ethos of the internet and censorship, the negative freedom of the 1st amendment that values speakers over speech.This is a larger case of what Lev Manovich (2001) coined as transcoding, a phenomenon that occurs when major works of conceptual transfer from media to culture have two-way conversations. Media influences society, and society influences media. In speaking about contemporary, computer-created “new media,” Manovich explains that media and culture “are being composited together. The result of this composite is the new computer culture: a blend of human and computer meanings, of traditional ways human culture modeled the world and computer’s own ways to represent it.”With Manovich as a lens we can see how neoliberal internet platforms and their regressive cloisters have preserved “truths” about gender or for-profit companies instead of allowing clearer understandings.The internet has become a capital production model that subsumes the social: your daily life, as well as your most private/personal understandings are being a monitored by a system that is attached to commercial processes. But as Terranova (2000) points out that “the question is not so much whether to love or hate technology, but an attempt to understand whether the Internet embodies a continuation of capital or a break with it… [I]t does neither. It is rather a mutation that is totally immanent to late capitalism.”With this understanding, we can better understand its impact on democracy. Returning to Dewey from over a century ago remind us that this problem existed before the internet and will likely persist beyond it.The deeper penetration of the movement into the social consciousness hasn’t been a challenge to the status quo with greater freedoms for all, as Silicon Valley elites might suggest, but it has instead been a boon of freedoms, capital, and privileges only to the elites themselves. We are being overwhelmed by these changes; it’s past time that we hold those that have the fortunate position accountable.³ Standpoint theory is feminist theory inspired by Hegel’s work understanding standpoints between slaves and their owners in the early 19th century. It was first adopted for understanding gender by Harstock (1983).⁴ Fraser (1990) theorizes an expansion of Habermas’s concept of the public sphere. She argues that the ability for marginalized individuals to find each other and form safe communities can serve to challenge the status quo. Habermas largely ignores the colonial reality of inequities due to race, gender, or class that can render his proposed market solutions of public debate inert. It is important to remember that actual revolution, historically, is led by the poor and disenfranchised and not the bourgeoisie elite. Fraser (1990) contested, among other things, that equality must not be ignored and brought in the idea of “rough equalities” that are more realistic than Habermas’s absolutes. She points to secretization from the point of the view of the subaltern as not necessarily detrimental to the nature of democracy. Marginalized groups that splinter partially away from a single, dominant public sphere can become “bases [or] training grounds for agitational activities directed toward wider publics” in interest of achieving greater power or equity.Dewey, J.

States like New York and California have set a $15 minimum wage, as have cities like Seattle. In the last year, Amazon announced $15-per-hour as its wage floor. But despite this momentum, the federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009, when it was set at $7.25 per hour.

The Raise the Wage Act of 2019 has broad support on the left, but backers are prepared to face opposition from conservatives and business leaders, who have profited off keeping wages low (In the past few years, the gulf between regular worker pay and CEO salaries has widened to a margin of 361 to one). Many workers earning lower wages have had to turn to government assistance programs to make ends meet, meaning that taxpayers are essentially having to make up for what companies refuse to provide.This is just one indication that the low minimum wage is not a tenable situation for the U.S., according to Oxfam America, a nonprofit focused on ending poverty. Raising the minimum wage would boost the economy through equipping people with more spending power, and alleviate some of the burden on taxpayers who fund assistance programs upon which low-wage workers have to depend. And most importantly, it would deliver immediate and tangible benefits to the 40 million workers in America laboring at the minimum wage.To illustrate just how striking the impact of a higher minimum wage would be, Oxfam America created an interactive map showing how people would benefit across the U.S. (You can play with the data at the bottom of this article.) Using data from the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, Oxfam conducted a state-by-state analysis of what proportion of workers are currently working at the minimum wage, and would benefit from a higher one. Some states, like California and Massachusetts, which have already been pushing a $15 minimum wage, would see very few workers get a raise. But in states like Nevada and Mississippi, where wages are low and many people work minimum-wage jobs, 40.3% and 41.6% of workers, respectively, would see their pay go up.The impact of a higher minimum wage is especially profound if assessed by demographic. Women and people of color would see, by far, the largest increases. If you filter the Oxfam map to show the percent of all women of color who would benefit from raising the minimum wage, nearly the whole map is dark blue, indicating that over 50% of workers would benefit. In Idaho, for instance, 68.6% of black women would get a raise.Of course, there are concerns around raising the minimum wage that test cases like Seattle have illustrated. If people’s per-shift pay is higher, one could imagine companies trying to reduce the number of shifts for workers to keep costs low. It’s imperative that wage hikes must be accompanied by legislation protecting workers’ rights to a shift schedule that would afford keeping up with the cost of living.And it’s arguable that by 2024, when the full wage increase is scheduled to phase in, $15 per hour will no longer be enough because it is so overdue: The Raise the Wage Act should not be a stopping point, but rather a reminder that wages must constantly evolve to keep pace with the economy and support the workers who depend on them.",1,9,Pro,Pro,Pro,0,Pro,"['Pro', 'Pro', 'Pro']","Should the Federal Minimum Wage Be Increased?

Soon, they may also be able to vote in Oregon. Legislators have proposed an amendment to the Oregon Constitution that would lower the voting age from 18 to 16. If the bill passes, voters would decide on the proposal in the 2020 election. State Sen. Shemia Fagan (D-Portland), one of the bill's sponsors, announced the bill on Monday. ""It's time to lower the voting age in Oregon and give young people a chance to participate at the ballot about decisions that affect their homes, their clean air and clean water future, their schools, and as we've seen, their very lives,"" Fagan said at a press conference. Bill sponsors say they want the amendment to extend to federal elections. Fagan pointed to the political activism of Parkland, Florida, students, who challenged lawmakers to tighten gun control laws after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last February. Samantha Gladu, executive director of the youth grassroots organization Bus Project, said 16- and 17-year-olds are engaged and smart enough to cast informed votes. ""They know that we have to take action urgently on issues like education funding, health care, climate justice and gun violence in particular,"" Gladu said. ""I'm also hearing a lot from 16- and 17-year-olds about the need for criminal justice reform and the need to stop mass incarceration."" Natalie Khalil, a senior at Lake Oswego High School in Oregon who has been organizing for gun law reform, said high school students should be able to apply the knowledge they learn in their civics classes. Allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote will ""create lifelong voters,"" Khalil said. Oregon Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr. opposes the idea. ""16-year-olds are too young to enlist in the military, too young to own firearms, too young to own property, too young to enter into legal contracts, and too young to get married. But they are old enough to vote? People are not legally considered adults in this country until they are 18 years old, and I believe they shouldn't be able to vote until then either,"" he said in a statement Tuesday. ""This is nothing more than an attempt to expand the voter rolls to sway elections."" Other places have toyed with the idea of allowing minors to vote. A 2016 proposal in San Francisco failed to pass but managed to earn 48% of the vote. Some cities in Maryland have already lowered the voting age to 16 for local elections. In Austria, Brazil and Argentina, the minimum age to vote is 16. The last time the voting age changed in the US was in 1971, when the 26th Amendment to the Constitution dropped the minimum age from 21 to 18. After President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the minimum age for the military draft to 18 during World War II, ""old enough to fight, old enough to vote"" became a popular slogan for the youth voting rights cause. The 26th Amendment guarantees citizens 18 and older the right to vote, but it does not prohibit states from setting a lower age. Fourteen states, including Oregon, currently allow people to preregister for voting when they are 16. Turnout among young voters (ages 18 to 29) is consistently lower than other age groups, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, young voter turnout for the 2018 midterms was unusually high at 31%, and they overwhelmingly favored Democratic candidates, the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement found. The District of Columbia suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, was the first US city to drop the age minimum to 16. In the first election after the law was passed, registered 16- and 17-year-olds had a 44% turnout compared to the 11% overall turnout rate in 2013, said Brian Conner, president of the National Youth Rights Association.

Reynolds would like to restore that right. Kelsey Kremer, kkremer@dmreg.com©Copyright 2019, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.Nearly two-thirds of Iowans support restoring voting rights to felons after they have completed their sentences, one of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ key priorities this year, according to a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll.The support spans gender, political affiliation, age groups, income levels and rural and urban poll respondents. Sixty-four percent of Iowans surveyed say they support restoring felons’ voting rights, with 29 percent opposed and 7 percent not sure.That includes support from 80 percent of Democrats and 66 percent of independents. The two groups that are the least favorable toward the idea — Republicans and rural voters — still show 50 percent in support.The poll of 803 Iowa adults was conducted Feb. 10-13 by Selzer & Co. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.In her Condition of the State address in January, Reynolds called on lawmakers to amend the Iowa Constitution to automatically restore felons’ voting rights. If enacted, Iowa would join the vast majority of states that have more permissive rules on felon voting.“I believe in second chances,” she said in an interview about the Iowa Poll results. “I believe Iowans overall believe in the power of redemption.”A constitutional amendment has some support in the Iowa Legislature — but the support could come with conditions.Some Iowa Republicans want to include a time delay or require payment of victim restitution or court fees before felons become eligible to vote again. Lawmakers could define what counts as a completed sentence through legislation that's separate from the constitutional amendment.Grace Cozad, a poll participant from Muscatine, said requiring restitution to be paid would prevent her from voting for years. She said she was convicted of a felony for forgery and theft several years ago. She still owes money in connection with her conviction, a reality that’s been compounded because she’s had difficulty getting a job due to her criminal background, she said.“It would mean the world to me to see something like this,” Cozad, 54, said of automatic restoration. “It would make a convicted felon feel like they belong in society once again.”Other people favor requiring felons to fully pay back their victims before they can vote.“Whether it takes them one year to pay back the restitution or whether it takes them 20 years, it doesn’t matter. As far as I see it, that is part of their sentence,” said Jenn Foltz, 49, a southern Iowan who works in insurance.Foltz, who responded in the poll that she opposes automatically restoring voting rights, said she’s open to it for nonviolent crimes but not for cases like murder.“I don’t think that somebody who flat-out killed someone should be able to vote,” she said.Restitution is not a part of the current process by which felons apply to the governor’s office to have their voting rights restored, a process that Reynolds has said she’s working to streamline.The governor has indicated skepticism about adding restitution payments to the restoration process.“I want to make sure that we’re not making it stricter than what we already have,” Reynolds said last month.The governor voiced hope that a constitutional amendment will advance this session.In her interview with the Register, Reynolds briefly theorized on the lower support among Republicans and rural voters.“I think the reason you see some of the hesitation is they just don’t want to lose sight of the victims,” she said.On that, Reynolds promised: “We aren’t, and I’m not.”For Reynolds, completing a sentence means a felon has finished the terms of their parole or probation. But she also indicated she’s open to making changes to the proposal, which lawmakers have begun to review. She declined to offer her opinion on whether the poll results could sway minds at the Capitol.“This is just part of the process … you can go find Republicans that are extremely supportive, and you might have some that have questions. That can happen on both sides,"" she said. ""It doesn’t mean that they are opposed or in favor. They’re just doing their due diligence and talking with their constituency and seeing how we move forward.”The governor said she will continue to push the issue.“We need to talk about it, and raise awareness and that’s happening across this country,” Reynolds said. “I’m going to continue to support and continue to talk about why I believe this is the right thing to do.”Iowa is one of two states, along with Kentucky, that permanently bars felons from voting unless the governor individually restores their voting rights.Florida had a similar prohibition on the books, but voters passed a constitutional amendment in November eliminating the state’s ban and restoring voting rights to approximately 1.4 million people.In Iowa, more than 50,000 people could become eligible to vote if the state enacts an amendment.The process of passing a constitutional amendment in Iowa takes years. Amendments must be passed by the Iowa Legislature in two separately elected two-year general assemblies and approved by Iowans in a statewide vote. The earliest Reynolds’ proposal could take effect would be 2022.Reynolds’ proposed amendment has begun moving through the Legislature this session; a resolution, SR4, unanimously passed a House subcommittee on Jan. 31. It must still pass a Senate subcommittee, full committees in each chamber and the full House and Senate to meet this year’s requirements. Then the process must be repeated with a new Legislature after the 2020 election. The governor does not need to sign proposed constitutional amendments.No groups have registered against the proposal.The governor has resisted calls to issue an executive order to immediately restore felon voting rights.Some Democrats and voting-rights advocates say Reynolds should issue an executive order to let felons vote now, rather than requiring them to wait years for a constitutional amendment to be enacted.“I would like to see this passed, but I would also like to see the governor to go ahead and change the rules and allow felons to vote until this takes place,” Sen. Kevin Kinney, D-Oxford, said of the constitutional amendment proposal in January.An executive order won’t provide long-term consistency for felons, Reynolds has said.In the last two decades, Iowa has seen multiple changes to rules on felon voting. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, signed an executive order in 2005 that automatically restored felons’ voting rights after their sentences were completed. That order was continued by his successor, Gov. Chet Culver, also a Democrat.When Gov. Terry Branstad took office, he reversed the Vilsack-Culver order in 2011, reinstating a process that required felons to individually apply to the governor’s office to have their rights restored. Reynolds was lieutenant governor at the time.The Iowa Poll, conducted Feb. 10-13 for The Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 803 Iowans ages 18 or older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cellphone numbers supplied by Survey Sampling International. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent census data.Questions based on the sample of 803 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.Republishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit to The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.",2,5,Pro,Pro,Neutral,0,Pro,"['Pro', 'Pro', 'Neutral']","Should Felons Who Have Completed Their Sentence (Incarceration, Probation, and Parole) Be Allowed to Vote?

Under current code, teachers are not allowed to use standardized test scores when grading students.HB118 sponsor Rep. Mike Winder, R-West Valley, said his bill “legalizes the carrots, while still forbidding the sticks and empowers a teacher, who determines grades anyway in a classroom, to provide academic rewards if a student does well on their standardized test.”Teachers would be allowed to let student proficiency “count for something” grade-wise, according to Winder.The bill would not impose penalties on students who perform poorly on the tests and students would still have the option to opt out of standardized assessments.“For example, an English teacher might say to little Billy, ‘Hey, you didn’t do so well on that last English test, but the standardized test is coming up. If you can demonstrate some proficiency there, then maybe you drop that last test,’” Winder said.Winder, a father of four, said his children do not always try their hardest on standardized tests because their performance does not impact their grade. Other students might try to sabotage a disliked teacher by purposefully performing poorly because teachers are evaluated based on their students’ scores.Rep. Melissa Ballard, R-North Salt Lake, said the bill would improve the integrity of statewide score statistics.“I think it will improve the outcome of our state testing to really know where we are and the ways that we can improve, but on an individual basis, I think it also incentivizes each child to learn the benefit of doing their best and being able to progress in their own academic spheres,” Ballard said.Rep. Travis Seegmiller, R-St. George, said he was concerned for students like “little Sally, the elementary school student with test anxiety disorder who throws up in the garbage can every time she takes a test longer than 90 minutes.”According to Winder, students like Sally would still be able to opt out of taking the test. Teachers would only be able to reward students who perform well, not penalize students who fall short.“So little Sally might not do well on that test and she still may need to take the final in that class,” Winder said. “But let’s say little Jose did poorly on the midterm. This would be an opportunity for him to take another test that he’s going to be taking anyway, if he’s part of the 93 percent of Utahans taking that test, and to have it count for something while not penalizing Sally at all.”Rep. Marie Poulson, D-Cottonwood Heights, shared her experience about the many standardized tests she administered as a teacher.“I found it very, very frustrating that it was very hard to encourage the kids to care about them,” Poulson said. “When I used to administer these tests before we did it on computers we’d have the bubbles and my students would see what kind of designs they could make — a butterfly, or a wasp, or dragon fly or something, rather than taking the test seriously.”She said she believed the bill would “strike a good balance” combating this problem.“Here in the state of Utah, we’re spending an awful lot of money on public education, and as an MBA by background, I know that if we can’t measure, we can’t manage,” Winder said. “Right now, there’s an awful lot of noise in the data because of students not trying their best on these tests.”This bill is supported by the Utah Parent Teacher Association, the Utah School Superintendents Association, the Utah School Boards Association, the Utah Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers Utah.Awards Mission of The Daily Universe Advertise with us BYU School of Communications Resources for journalism educatorsHelp and Contact Information Newstips Reader Representative Subscribe Universe Staff Login",2,1,Neutral,Pro,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Pro', 'Neutral']","Is the Use of Standardized Tests Improving Education in America?

The best protection against this is to make basic income provision a law rather than just as a scheme, so that it cannot be withdrawn. Secondly, the real value of the basic income needs to be protected against inflation. Which means that it needs to be inflation-indexed so that the real value of the money does not get eroded with the passage of time and rise in inflation. We could think of a lead time of five years before we make a law.Lastly, the ?unconditional? nature of basic income. This is perhaps the most radical of all the elements of UBI, and also happens to be most alien to our welfare grammar. All welfare schemes have conditionalities because we see the task of poverty alleviation as a matter of charity?a paternalistic act of giving alms to someone who has fallen behind in the race. This attitude completely overlooks the fact that large sections of the population are in a state of deprivation because of unequal opportunities; and that they have the right to partake at least minimum support from the fruits of the community as a matter of right rather than as charity.

7,Vegetarianism,Should People Become Vegetarian?,2s7q7r,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americas-biggest-meat-producer-will-soon-offer-vegan-protein-2019-02-14,America’s biggest meat producer wants to take a bite out of the vegetarian market - MarketWatch,"Published: Feb 18, 2019 10:43 a.m. ETAs scientists caution about the health of meat products, more food companies are moving into alternative meat productsByThe biggest meat producer in the U.S. is going meatless. Tyson Foods, the maker of hot dogs, steak strips, and chicken nuggets, announced last week it plans to debut a vegan protein this year, marking its foray into the plant-based meat market as the demand for vegan options reaches an all-time high. Noel White, president and chief executive at Tyson Foods said during its first-quarter earnings call that the brand aims to make “protein alternatives.” The company first invested in California-based vegan meat alternative company Beyond Meat in 2016. It also reported a decline in sales in the latest quarter, as it grapples with falling meat prices in most of its key segments.There may be other advantages to taking a bite out of the vegetarian market. Last month, Tyson said it would recall 36,000 pounds of chicken nuggets after customers said they found pieces of “soft, blue rubber” inside, the Associated Press reported. The U.S. Agriculture Department said the 5-pound (2-kilogram) bags should be thrown away or returned, but the government agency said there were no reports of people being sick from the products. (In 2017, it recalled 2.5 million pounds of breaded chicken for misbranding the products. In 2015, it recalled 52,486 of chicken wings.)There have been more studies about the effects of eating meat in recent years. Red meat is “not essential” and has been linked to mortality and other health risks, a group of scientists said in a major report released last month. People need to change the way they eat and cut too much meat out of the diet, according to the report from the EAT-Lancet Commission, a group of 30 scientists who are researching and promoting healthy and sustainable diets worldwide. A healthy diet should actually have “low amounts” of food that come from animal sources, they said. In fact, many of the nutrients people rely on from meat for, such as protein, can just as easily come from plants like vegetables, legumes and nuts, such as peanuts, they added. Their recommendation: The ideal amount to eat would be none, especially if you replace it with plant-based sources of protein. Also read: Beyond Meat is going public: 5 things you need to know about the plant-based meat maker Vegan products including jackfruit, black bean burgers, mushroom mince and cauliflower are becoming popular substitutes for barbecue meats such as steak and sausage.More brands continue to show interest in the growing category. While they don’t come with the same health risks, alternative meats are often more expensive than the real thing. Fast-food chain Shake Shack added another veggie burger to its menu last year at select locations made with black beans, brown rice and roasted beets topped with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles and vegan mustard mayo. The Shake Shack veggie burger will cost $7.29 versus $5.55 for a ShackBurger.Last April, White Castle, known for its square beef sliders, started serving the $1.99 Impossible Burger, which is made with a red iron molecule called heme that’s found in meat and some plants. It makes food cook, bleed and taste like real beef. It’s made with smoked cheddar cheese, onions and pickles with a 2-ounce patty. It’s more than double the price of the 0.9-ounce mini-cheeseburger, which costs less than $1. Impossible Foods — the makers behind the Impossible Burger — said last month its plans to beef up its meatless portfolio by adding a vegan steak next. The meatless substitute market had around $555 million in revenue in 2017 and it’s growing at around 6% per year, according to a report from Nielsen, the Good Food Institute and the Plant Based Foods Association. Tofu and tempeh sales were up around 2.6% at $99 million in 2017.One-third of all Americans, and 37% of millennials, plan to buy more plant-based products over the next year, according to Mintel’s 2018 Summer Food & Drink Trends report. And while the majority of North American consumers still opt for meat as their primary source of protein, 23% of eaters want more plant-based options on shelves, according to data from Nielsen. “The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee concluded that for people older than 2 years, a balanced vegetarian diet can be a healthy eating pattern,” the EAT-Lancet Commission scientists wrote. In the largest study of vegetarian diets, scientists concluded people who follow vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian or semi-vegetarian diets actually had a 12% lower mortality risk than people who are omnivores. Those who had the lowest risk: Pescatarians (people who don’t eat meat, but do eat vegetables and fish).Researchers from the European Association for the Study of Obesity compared a vegetarian diet with the Mediterranean diet, which is based on eating habits of those in Greece and Italy and relies heavily on fish and fruits and vegetables, and the so-called “U.S.-healthy diet” based on government-distributed dietary guidelines. And on average, someone following a vegetarian would have spent $2 less per day, their analysis released last year found.To produce the analysis, researchers created two-week menu plans assessed for their nutritional quality and used the cheapest price available from Amazon When cooking vegetarian dishes from scratch, they typically cost less than meat-based dishes. While all three diets were comparable in terms of nutritional quality, the vegetarian diet only cost $15.40 per day on average, versus $17 for the U.S.-healthy diet and $17.30 for the Mediterranean diet. But some people say it’s worth paying more for veggie burgers and other alternative meat products. Plant-based diets and products are appealing to increasingly health-conscious foodies. New York City student Myra Sabet, 22, became a vegetarian over two years ago because she was worried about her family’s history of heart disease. “There were a lot of health conditions that arise from eating meat, and I realized a lot of my family members have had heart problems from it, as well,” she told MarketWatch. It has been a relatively easy transition because she’s not alone. “I have noticed that especially here in New York, a lot of people in college are trying to eat clean and healthy,” she said.Tyson reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $10.193 billion, falling short of the FactSet consensus of $10.361 billion and down from $10.229 billion a year ago. Shares in the company, however, are up around 15% year to date. The Dow Jones Industrial Index is up 9.6% over the same period.

26,Animal Testing,Should Animals Be Used for Scientific or Commercial Testing?,1s26q6r,http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/3/112/112fs11.full,3Rs of Animal Testing for Regenerative Medicine Products | Science Translational Medicine,"Advertisement See allHide authors and affiliations Considerations of animal welfare have spurred the design of “smarter” preclinical studies intended to ultimately benefit patients.Preclinical testing with the use of animal models is important in the development of novel Regenerative Medicine (RM) products before first administration in patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implements 3Rs—reduce, refine, replace—for such preclinical studies in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Regenerative Medicine (RM) products. Here, I summarize some of FDA’s insights and efforts into executing the 3Rs in regulatory research, product review practices, and policy arenas for Regenerative Medicine (RM) products.RM products for a variety of disease and injury applications are beginning to move from the laboratory bench toward the patient’s bedside. According to FDA regulations, the sponsor of a clinical trial for an investigational new drug application (IND) should provide “adequate information about the pharmacological and toxicological studies… on the basis of which the sponsor has concluded that it is reasonably safe to conduct the proposed clinical investigations” (1). For sponsors of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application, the FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of the IDE if the “device is intended for a serious disease or condition and there is insufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to support such use…” (2). The design of preclinical studies is thus a critical component in the generation of appropriate and sufficient data to support the clinical development of an investigational medical product. Such studies can potentially serve to both illuminate and mitigate some of the risks to humans enrolled in clinical trials (Fig. 1).Shown are examples of application of the 3Rs in preclinical testing programs that involve the use of animals during the development of RM products. As the Venn diagram indicates, many of these programs may overlap with one or all of the 3Rs. LAL, limulus amebocyte lysate; MAT, monocyte activation test.As product development progresses, usually a combination of in vitro experiments and animal studies is needed to characterize the safety and effectiveness profiles of an investigational product. In the RM arena, these products are complex; many consist of multiple components, such as a biologic (a cellular product) and a device (such as a biopolymer scaffold for delivery of the biologic). Because cellular components range from stem cell–derived to functionally differentiated products from autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic sources, potential safety concerns include undesired immune reactions and tumor formation. The scaffold complications can include bioactive degradation products and adverse effects to the tissue that surrounds the implanted device. Therefore, these RM products require multifactorial safety and effectiveness profiles.The Public Health Service (PHS) and thereby FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) adopts the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training (the Principles) (3) for preclinical studies that involve animals. Therefore, when performing or contracting animal research for a given product, prospective clinical sponsors should adhere to the nine Principles in (3)—which include minimizing pain and distress, employing trained animal-care personnel, and using the fewest possible animals and alternatives to animals when appropriate. Another important publication, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide) (4), provides detailed guidance on implementation of the Principles in (3) and the proper and humane care of laboratory animals. Any PHS-funded research [such as studies that rely on grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)] must be conducted within the boundaries of the Principles and the Guide, which are included in FDA guidance documents (5–7). In December 2010, FDA issued an advance notice of proposed rule-making (ANPRM) (8) to advise the public of its intention to amend the regulations for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (9) so as to address animal welfare.Another way that FDA encourages implementation of the nine Principles is by practicing the 3Rs when animals are used in preclinical studies as part of a medical–product development program. First proposed by Russell and Burch in 1959, the 3Rs provide a strategy for reduction, refinement, and replacement in animal testing, and are an internationally accepted (10) approach for sponsors and investigators to apply when using animals in their preclinical studies. According to the Guide, the 3Rs are defined as follows: (i) Reduction refers to methods that minimize animal use and enable researchers to obtain comparable amounts of information from fewer animals or to obtain more information from the same number of animals without increasing pain or distress. (ii) Refinement refers to methods that minimize or alleviate potential pain and distress and enhance well-being for the life of the animal. (iii) Replacement refers to methods that avoid the use of animals by replacing them with other systems, such as cells or lower organisms.FDA’s strong endorsement of strategies to implement the 3Rs when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of a RM product is evident in FDA regulatory research, review practice, and policy.FDA is committed to advancing regulatory science through the development of new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA-regulated products. One way FDA is advancing regulatory science is through the Tox21 collaboration (http://www.epa.gov/ncct/Tox21), which works to research, develop, validate, and translate innovative chemical testing methods that characterize toxicity pathways. The Tox21 collaboration has led to development of a new high-speed robotic screening system that can test 10,000 different chemicals for potential toxicity. Use of this robot may lead to a reduction in animals used for toxicity testing of RM products.Both CDRH and CBER have multiple ongoing research projects that seek to find alternative methods and systems for testing the safety of RM products. For example, the Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) at CDRH investigates use of computational models to predict cardiovascular device behavior (degradation, fatigue, wear) after in vivo administration (http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDRH/CDRHReports/ucm274152.htm). One of the ongoing projects of the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) at CBER involves biomarker development to predict in vivo biological and pathological responses to RM products. Data from research projects in these FDA centers are made available through presentations at scientific meetings, at public workshops, and in publications, increasing the potential impact these projects may have on expanding use of the 3Rs.RM product development requires a pyramid of preclinical assessments, starting with proof-of-concept studies and ending with pivotal safety studies, before use of the product in a patient population. The extent of the preclinical program for these products depends on the novelty and complexity of the biological and device components and the planned clinical use. CBER/CDRH encourages early communication so as to discuss the preclinical program envisioned for an RM product by its sponsor. The presubmission pathway (the pre-IND or pre-IDE meetings) provides an effective means to achieve this goal. These interactions enable sponsors to interact with subject-matter experts—in pharmacology, toxicology, veterinary medicine, chemistry, biomedical engineering, materials science, clinical medicine, and statistics—on the various components of their RM product and to receive comments, questions, and recommendations from CBER/CDRH on the proposed preclinical studies, with implementation of the 3Rs wherever feasible and appropriate from a scientific and regulatory perspective. Thus, FDA encourages the sponsor to review the Guide and the Principles before the presubmission meeting and to discuss possible modifications to preclinical testing programs in these early interactions in order to ensure that researchers conduct a high-quality, appropriately sized GLP study that will not need to be repeated, reducing animal use.Selection of appropriate animal species is probably the most important aspect of a preclinical testing program. First, the species used should be responsive to the biological component being introduced. For RM products, considerations include the nature of the cellular-product component, the anatomical site of product administration, the total surface area of the finalized device component, and required study endpoints. Choosing an animal model of disease or injury that to some extent recapitulates the pathogenesis of the given disease or injury in humans may also help to fulfill certain aspects of the 3Rs. Whenever feasible, CBER/OCTGT recommends the use of hybrid pharmacology and toxicology studies in animal models of disease or injury—those that encompass the assessment of safety and effectiveness endpoints relevant to the proposed clinical indication and to the investigational RM product. This strategy allows for the collection and evaluation of multiple data points intended to capture dose-activity and dose-toxicity profiles in the minimum number of animals deemed necessary. Such designs can provide strong support for fulfilling the 3Rs.FDA also weaves the 3Rs into their regulatory review practice by encouraging investigators to increase the frequency with which they assess clinical parameters in animal studies. As suggested in a CDRH guidance document (5), this can be accomplished by following current standards of record-keeping in veterinary medicine, such as the subjective/objective assessment and plan (SOAP) format. This practice ensures that observed adverse findings are managed in as timely a manner as possible in order to reduce pain and distress, benefiting the animal’s welfare. Furthermore, by closely monitoring the animals, such findings can be appropriately investigated to determine a possible cause, which in turn can inform necessary changes to the preclinical study protocol (such as reduction of dose, inclusion of additional monitoring, or early termination of the study) and can help to guide in design of the initial safety trials in patients.Finally, another way FDA incorporates the 3Rs into its regulatory practices is through leveraging known and accessible data (from published literature or other sources) on particular products to reduce the size and number of animal studies. This can be particularly useful for the device component of the RM product. For example, if the toxicity of a scaffold implanted in a particular anatomical site or for a particular anatomical use is well understood, then scaffold toxicity studies in animals may not be necessary or may be reduced in scope.FDA also actively promotes the 3Rs through regulatory policy and outreach endeavors, such as the promotion of potential alternatives to animal testing. In addition to outreach through participation at scientific meetings, FDA engages in collaborative programs and initiatives such as the Interagency Center Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM; http://iccvam.niehs.nih.gov). ICCVAM’s directive is to promote the regulatory acceptance of new and scientifically valid toxicological tests that protect human and animal health while incorporating the 3Rs. Since 1998, this interagency group has contributed to national and international acceptance of 42 alternative safety-testing methods, 24 of which do not involve animals.As representatives of FDA, CBER and CDRH also actively participate in the Multi-Agency Tissue Engineering Science (MATES) Interagency Working Group. Established in 2000 under the Subcommittee on Biotechnology of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), the primary purpose of MATES is to provide a platform between the member federal agencies for interaction and exchange on the science and technologies of tissue engineering (http://www.tissueengineering.gov). One of the ongoing activities of this group involves the organization of workshops on safety-testing methods that are possible alternatives to animal use.Beginning in 2010, NIH and FDA partnered to advance public health through an initiative designed to accelerate the process from scientific discovery to availability of medical therapies for patients through the Advancing Regulatory Science (ARS) Initiative. Part of this initiative involved establishment of the Advancing Regulatory Science through Novel Research and Science-Based Technologies grant program (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-RM-10-006.html). The goal of this program is to fund research on the applicability of novel technologies to support improved evaluation of product safety, quality, effectiveness, and manufacturing throughout the product life cycle. In the first round of funding, one of these grants was awarded to a project that is investigating integration of organ-on-chip microdevices to produce a heart-lung micromachine. This innovative product combines microfabrication techniques from the computer industry with modern tissue-engineering techniques in order to replicate the complex physiological functions and mechanical microenvironment of a functional heart and lung. According to the grant, the goal of this microdevice is to provide accurate and immediate measures of the efficacy and safety of inhaled drugs, nanotherapeutics, and other medical products on integrated heart and lung function (http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8068443&icde=0). The success of this project may lead to a reduction in, and perhaps replacement of, animal use for certain safety tests. This example illustrates how consideration of the 3Rs has spurred efforts to design “smarter” preclinical studies intended to ultimately benefit the patient.Vol 3, Issue 11207 December 2011 By Rebecca RobinsonScience Translational Medicine07 Dec 2011 : 112fs11 Considerations of animal welfare have spurred the design of “smarter” preclinical studies intended to ultimately benefit patients.AdvertisementAdvertisementVol 363, Issue 6431Table of ContentsReceive a year subscription to Science plus access to exclusive AAAS member resources, opportunities, and benefits.Subscribe TodayReceive emails from Science.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implements 3Rs—reduce, refine, replace—for such preclinical studies in order to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Regenerative Medicine (RM) products. Here, I summarize some of FDA’s insights and efforts into executing the 3Rs in regulatory research, product review practices, and policy arenas for Regenerative Medicine (RM) products.RM products for a variety of disease and injury applications are beginning to move from the laboratory bench toward the patient’s bedside. According to FDA regulations, the sponsor of a clinical trial for an investigational new drug application (IND) should provide “adequate information about the pharmacological and toxicological studies… on the basis of which the sponsor has concluded that it is reasonably safe to conduct the proposed clinical investigations” (1). For sponsors of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application, the FDA may disapprove or withdraw approval of the IDE if the “device is intended for a serious disease or condition and there is insufficient evidence of safety and effectiveness to support such use…” (2). The design of preclinical studies is thus a critical component in the generation of appropriate and sufficient data to support the clinical development of an investigational medical product. Such studies can potentially serve to both illuminate and mitigate some of the risks to humans enrolled in clinical trials (Fig. 1).Shown are examples of application of the 3Rs in preclinical testing programs that involve the use of animals during the development of RM products. As the Venn diagram indicates, many of these programs may overlap with one or all of the 3Rs. LAL, limulus amebocyte lysate; MAT, monocyte activation test.As product development progresses, usually a combination of in vitro experiments and animal studies is needed to characterize the safety and effectiveness profiles of an investigational product. In the RM arena, these products are complex; many consist of multiple components, such as a biologic (a cellular product) and a device (such as a biopolymer scaffold for delivery of the biologic). Because cellular components range from stem cell–derived to functionally differentiated products from autologous, allogeneic, or xenogeneic sources, potential safety concerns include undesired immune reactions and tumor formation. The scaffold complications can include bioactive degradation products and adverse effects to the tissue that surrounds the implanted device. Therefore, these RM products require multifactorial safety and effectiveness profiles.The Public Health Service (PHS) and thereby FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) adopts the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training (the Principles) (3) for preclinical studies that involve animals. Therefore, when performing or contracting animal research for a given product, prospective clinical sponsors should adhere to the nine Principles in (3)—which include minimizing pain and distress, employing trained animal-care personnel, and using the fewest possible animals and alternatives to animals when appropriate. Another important publication, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide) (4), provides detailed guidance on implementation of the Principles in (3) and the proper and humane care of laboratory animals. Any PHS-funded research [such as studies that rely on grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)] must be conducted within the boundaries of the Principles and the Guide, which are included in FDA guidance documents (5–7). In December 2010, FDA issued an advance notice of proposed rule-making (ANPRM) (8) to advise the public of its intention to amend the regulations for Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (9) so as to address animal welfare.Another way that FDA encourages implementation of the nine Principles is by practicing the 3Rs when animals are used in preclinical studies as part of a medical–product development program. First proposed by Russell and Burch in 1959, the 3Rs provide a strategy for reduction, refinement, and replacement in animal testing, and are an internationally accepted (10) approach for sponsors and investigators to apply when using animals in their preclinical studies. According to the Guide, the 3Rs are defined as follows: (i) Reduction refers to methods that minimize animal use and enable researchers to obtain comparable amounts of information from fewer animals or to obtain more information from the same number of animals without increasing pain or distress. (ii) Refinement refers to methods that minimize or alleviate potential pain and distress and enhance well-being for the life of the animal. (iii) Replacement refers to methods that avoid the use of animals by replacing them with other systems, such as cells or lower organisms.FDA’s strong endorsement of strategies to implement the 3Rs when evaluating the safety and effectiveness of a RM product is evident in FDA regulatory research, review practice, and policy.FDA is committed to advancing regulatory science through the development of new tools, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of FDA-regulated products. One way FDA is advancing regulatory science is through the Tox21 collaboration (http://www.epa.gov/ncct/Tox21), which works to research, develop, validate, and translate innovative chemical testing methods that characterize toxicity pathways. The Tox21 collaboration has led to development of a new high-speed robotic screening system that can test 10,000 different chemicals for potential toxicity. Use of this robot may lead to a reduction in animals used for toxicity testing of RM products.Both CDRH and CBER have multiple ongoing research projects that seek to find alternative methods and systems for testing the safety of RM products. For example, the Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) at CDRH investigates use of computational models to predict cardiovascular device behavior (degradation, fatigue, wear) after in vivo administration (http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDRH/CDRHReports/ucm274152.htm). One of the ongoing projects of the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies (OCTGT) at CBER involves biomarker development to predict in vivo biological and pathological responses to RM products. Data from research projects in these FDA centers are made available through presentations at scientific meetings, at public workshops, and in publications, increasing the potential impact these projects may have on expanding use of the 3Rs.RM product development requires a pyramid of preclinical assessments, starting with proof-of-concept studies and ending with pivotal safety studies, before use of the product in a patient population. The extent of the preclinical program for these products depends on the novelty and complexity of the biological and device components and the planned clinical use. CBER/CDRH encourages early communication so as to discuss the preclinical program envisioned for an RM product by its sponsor. The presubmission pathway (the pre-IND or pre-IDE meetings) provides an effective means to achieve this goal. These interactions enable sponsors to interact with subject-matter experts—in pharmacology, toxicology, veterinary medicine, chemistry, biomedical engineering, materials science, clinical medicine, and statistics—on the various components of their RM product and to receive comments, questions, and recommendations from CBER/CDRH on the proposed preclinical studies, with implementation of the 3Rs wherever feasible and appropriate from a scientific and regulatory perspective.

16,Teacher Tenure,Should Teachers Get Tenure?,1s16q5r,https://nypost.com/2012/08/25/tackling-ny-teacher-tenure/,Tackling NY teacher tenure,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Opinion By Marcus A. WintersContact The Author Submit August 25, 2012 | 4:00am Prompted by abundant research that points to teachers as the key school-based ingredient in education, New York City and other large districts have wisely focused considerable effort on removing their worst ones. A key method: tenure reform.And while the 55 percent tenure-approval rate for this year, which the city announced last week, suggests that New York is indeed raising the bar, it fails to answer a key question: Why should any teachers, who consider themselves professionals, get tenure in the first place? Once tenured, a teacher cannot be fired without due process. Technically, that doesn’t guarantee a teacher’s job for life. But in practice, the due process required to remove a tenured teacher is so burdensome and has such little probability of success that most schools don’t even attempt to remove the worst of them.Just eight public-school teachers, in total, were fired for incompetence during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 school years — and six of those cases included an additional charge, such as insubordination or misconduct. Surely there are more than eight teachers to whom you would not want your child assigned.Job protections wouldn’t be so concerning if they were granted only to deserving teachers. But like many other school systems, New York’s teachers are eligible for tenure after just three years. That’s far too soon to know if a teacher really has what it takes. It also reflects the unreasonable assumption that a teacher will never regress.Worst of all, until recently, performance in the classroom had little influence on whether a teacher was granted tenure. In 2006, about 99 percent of eligible teachers got tenure on the first try. Under Mayor Bloomberg, New York has primarily addressed the issue by making tenure harder to earn. And the progress is commendable. But while the tenure-approval rate dropped to 55 percent last year, probation was extended to most of the remaining teachers, some 42 percent of the total; just 3 percent of eligible teachers were denied tenure outright. The effort to ratchet up the standard for tenure will mean little if it just makes bad teachers wait another year or two before they get lifetime job protections.Of course, the answer isn’t necessarily to shuffle more teachers out the door immediately. Like other professionals, most teachers are performing well enough to avoid termination but not so well as to deserve permanent job protections.But again, the persistent low tenure-denial rate shows the need to rethink the relationship between public schools and teachers. The real question, again, is: As professionals, why do any public-school teachers deserve lifetime job protections?Tenure’s defenders are quick to point out that, before the practice existed, teachers were often inappropriately terminated for their political beliefs, cronyism and even getting pregnant. That’s true. But employment laws protect workers against such egregious actions today.Further, past administrators could get away with improperly removing truly effective teachers in part because schools lacked objective measures of performance. But the ubiquity of standardized testing now allows us in many cases to objectively identify the system’s worst teachers.Like many other school systems, New York now uses a method known as “value added” to measure each teacher’s independent influence on his students’ performance on standardized tests. Though the results of this procedure are undoubtedly imperfect and should thus not be used in isolation to fire teachers, research shows that a teacher’s value-added score one year contains information that dramatically improves our ability to identify teachers who will continue to perform poorly in the future.Other states, including neighboring New Jersey, have recently adopted laws that revoke the tenure of teachers who have performed poorly repeatedly. New York should follow their lead.Teachers are what make the difference in a public school. Taking that simple and obvious lesson from empirical research seriously means allowing schools to remove those teachers who are not making a difference in the lives of their students, even if they have managed to stick around for more than three years.Marcus A. Winters is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, assistant professor at the University of Colorado and author of a forthcoming report on teacher tenure.

A key method: tenure reform.And while the 55 percent tenure-approval rate for this year, which the city announced last week, suggests that New York is indeed raising the bar, it fails to answer a key question: Why should any teachers, who consider themselves professionals, get tenure in the first place? Once tenured, a teacher cannot be fired without due process. Technically, that doesn’t guarantee a teacher’s job for life. But in practice, the due process required to remove a tenured teacher is so burdensome and has such little probability of success that most schools don’t even attempt to remove the worst of them.Just eight public-school teachers, in total, were fired for incompetence during the 2007-08 and 2008-09 school years — and six of those cases included an additional charge, such as insubordination or misconduct. Surely there are more than eight teachers to whom you would not want your child assigned.Job protections wouldn’t be so concerning if they were granted only to deserving teachers. But like many other school systems, New York’s teachers are eligible for tenure after just three years. That’s far too soon to know if a teacher really has what it takes. It also reflects the unreasonable assumption that a teacher will never regress.Worst of all, until recently, performance in the classroom had little influence on whether a teacher was granted tenure. In 2006, about 99 percent of eligible teachers got tenure on the first try. Under Mayor Bloomberg, New York has primarily addressed the issue by making tenure harder to earn. And the progress is commendable. But while the tenure-approval rate dropped to 55 percent last year, probation was extended to most of the remaining teachers, some 42 percent of the total; just 3 percent of eligible teachers were denied tenure outright. The effort to ratchet up the standard for tenure will mean little if it just makes bad teachers wait another year or two before they get lifetime job protections.Of course, the answer isn’t necessarily to shuffle more teachers out the door immediately. Like other professionals, most teachers are performing well enough to avoid termination but not so well as to deserve permanent job protections.But again, the persistent low tenure-denial rate shows the need to rethink the relationship between public schools and teachers. The real question, again, is: As professionals, why do any public-school teachers deserve lifetime job protections?Tenure’s defenders are quick to point out that, before the practice existed, teachers were often inappropriately terminated for their political beliefs, cronyism and even getting pregnant. That’s true. But employment laws protect workers against such egregious actions today.Further, past administrators could get away with improperly removing truly effective teachers in part because schools lacked objective measures of performance. But the ubiquity of standardized testing now allows us in many cases to objectively identify the system’s worst teachers.Like many other school systems, New York now uses a method known as “value added” to measure each teacher’s independent influence on his students’ performance on standardized tests. Though the results of this procedure are undoubtedly imperfect and should thus not be used in isolation to fire teachers, research shows that a teacher’s value-added score one year contains information that dramatically improves our ability to identify teachers who will continue to perform poorly in the future.Other states, including neighboring New Jersey, have recently adopted laws that revoke the tenure of teachers who have performed poorly repeatedly. New York should follow their lead.Teachers are what make the difference in a public school. Taking that simple and obvious lesson from empirical research seriously means allowing schools to remove those teachers who are not making a difference in the lives of their students, even if they have managed to stick around for more than three years.Marcus A. Winters is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, assistant professor at the University of Colorado and author of a forthcoming report on teacher tenure.

36,Electoral College,Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections?,1s36q3r,https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-judge-weighing-legality-of-TX-13615114.php,San Antonio judge weighs legality of Electoral College process in choosing a president - ExpressNews.com,"Lawyers for the state on Wednesday asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit challenging Texas’ Electoral College process as plaintiffs dug in to their claims that the winner-take-all method is unconstitutional, discriminatory and leads to the dilution of the minority vote. A coalition of law firms and the League of United Latin American Citizens filed four federal lawsuits last February in two politically red states, Texas and South Carolina, and two traditionally blue states, California and Massachusetts. All four lawsuits challenge the constitutionality of the winner-take-all method that states use to allocate their Electoral College votes. The suits against Texas and South Carolina also allege those state’s methods violate the Voting Rights Act’s Section 2, which prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race or color or against minority groups. Texas is one of 48 states with the winner-take-all system, in which a candidate who receives a majority of the popular vote, or a plurality of it, takes all of the state’s electoral votes. The other two states, Maine and Nebraska, allocate electors based on votes in congressional districts. Federal judges have dismissed the lawsuits in California and Massachusetts, but they remain pending at the appellate level. The Texas and South Carolina cases are still at the federal district court level. On ExpressNews.com: Suits say Electoral College process is illegal Senior U.S. District Judge David A. Ezra heard the first arguments in the Texas case during an hour and a half hearing Wednesday in San Antonio. One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, David Boies, argued that Texas’ winner-take-all method creates a two-step process, where voters elect the electors and the electors elect the president. The method, he argued, systematically discards the votes of nearly half of the state’s voters while greatly magnifying the votes of others. This, he said, violates the constitutional principle of “one person, one vote” under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the free speech and associational rights of Texas voters under the First Amendment. Luis Vera Jr. of San Antonio, LULAC’s national general counsel, argued that the system also violates the protections of Section 2. In Texas, Latino and African American voters generally vote Democratic, yet while their candidate may get a good chunk of the popular vote, that candidate gets no electors if he or she doesn’t win a majority of the votes The minority vote “means nothing in the presidential election,” Vera argued. “In Texas, their vote is counted and then thrown away.” The plaintiffs seek to force Texas to implement rules that would allocate electors proportionally. Assistant Texas attorneys general Matthew Frederick, Patrick Sweeten and Todd Disher argued that the winner-take-all method has been in place for 230 years and is legally and constitutionally sound, including in Texas. “That system has been used by the states for more than two centuries, dating back to the first election of George Washington,” Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement after the hearing. “It’s no coincidence that every lawsuit asking the courts to upend the Electoral College has failed. Changing or eliminating the Electoral College can only be done by an amendment to the Constitution, which is reason enough the district court should dismiss this latest legal challenge.” As part of their argument, the state’s lawyers claim Texans in presidential elections cast a vote for electors, not for president. In turn, they argue that Texas’ election for electors treats every vote equally. They also argued that the Texas suit fails to establish why Section 2 applies. “This is not an issue of racism,” Frederick told the judge, adding that the plaintiffs’ claim that Texas’ method is a two-step system is wrong. “There is only one step,” Frederick said. “The votes are tallied. They are not thrown away. They’re counted.” Judge Ezra said he would “take whatever time is necessary” to review the arguments and the case law before issuing his ruling. He said the issue could eventually land in the Supreme Court.",1,3,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,0,Neutral,"['Neutral', 'Neutral', 'Neutral']","Should the United States Use the Electoral College in Presidential Elections?

35,Voting Machines,Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?,2s35q6r,https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/commission-recommends-pennsylvania-security-measures-for-elections/,Commission recommends Pennsylvania  security measures for elections | TribLIVE.com,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.Pennsylvania lawmakers and county leaders must move quickly to secure the state’s election infrastructure in advance of the 2020 presidential election, an independent bipartisan commission said Tuesday.The Blue Ribbon Commission on Pennsylvania’s Election Security recommended that the state and federal government provide money to help underwrite the costs for counties facing a major investment to replace electronic voting machines with machines that incorporate voter-verified paper ballots.Although they found no evidence that Pennsylvania elections had been hacked, commission co-chairmen David Hickton, a former U.S. attorney who founded the University of Pittsburgh Institute for Cyber Law, Policy and Security, and Grove City College President Paul McNulty, a former deputy U.S. attorney general, said the threats to election security are great.“We have little doubt that foreign adversaries will increase their efforts in the lead-up to the presidential election in 2020. The persistence and sophistication of these actors are only increasing.“We must not pretend that the existing election architecture from an era of flip phones is sufficient to withstand a determined foreign adversary. Improving it will require political will, including funding. And it will require that the commonwealth and counties be prepared to administer an election even in the face of a cyber attack,” Hickton and McNulty wrote in the 72-page report.Hickton said he’s hopeful that lawmakers will accept the commission’s recommendations and act swiftly.Pennsylvania is among 13 states where most or all voters use machines that store votes electronically without printed ballots or backups that could be audited to check votes.The push for new machines followed a finding by federal authorities that Russian hackers targeted at least 21 states during the 2016 presidential election.Hickton convened the Blue Ribbon Commission, a group of about two dozen civic leaders and election experts, last spring to study Pennsylvania’s vulnerabilities and offer recommendations for improvement. The commission studied the state’s voting machines and election management as well as voter registration processes and provisions for operations in the event of a cyber attack of technical failure.Its conclusions echoed those of Gov. Tom Wolf, who last year concluded a costly overhaul was necessary to ensure the security of the state’s elections.In addition to calling for upgraded voting machines, the commission called for better training of poll workers to provide for procedures in the event of equipment failure as well as modifications to the election code to provide “clear authority for the suspension or extension of elections due to a wide-scale, cyber-related attack, nature disaster or other emergency that disrupts voting.”The report comes as county officials across the state look to buy new secure voting systems.Beth Lechman, director of Westmoreland County’s election bureau, said county officials are weighing five different vendors who demonstrated systems believed to meet new specifications. Three of them have been approved by the state. The other two are expected to be approved shortly.The system would replace an electronic system purchased in 2006. Lechman said preliminary estimates place the cost for the county, which counts 235,175 registered voters, at about $7 million.Lechman said officials hope to make a final decision in March and have the new system installed in time for the general election this fall.Allegheny County has about four times as many voters, and officials have pegged the cost of voting machine upgrades at about $25 million.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

And to some of the people who drop in on Kansas news occasionally for whatever reason.Here’s the basic point: The extremists who introduced the anti-gay measures in the Kansas Legislature this week don’t represent what Kansas is all about. Their efforts are sure to fail, because the rest of the Legislature and the governor are more level-headed. That’s the real Kansas.The bill we’re talking about is an attempt to end the government’s recognition of same-sex marriage. The text of the bill includes this: “The government’s endorsement of LGBTQ ideology has amounted to the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence.” It goes on to say that “so-called marriages that do not involve a man and a woman ... amount to doctrines that are inseparably linked to the religion of secular humanism.”In fact, the bill is an interesting intellectual contortion, attempting to say that the government is promoting a particular religion by endorsing same-sex marriages.

Editorial: Anti-gay legislation not what level-headed Kansas is about - Opinion - The Garden City Telegram - Garden City, KS AdvertisementSubscribe to The Garden City TelegramWe’d like to take up this space today to send a message to friends and family members who live out of state. And to some of the people who drop in on Kansas news occasionally for whatever reason.Here’s the basic point: The extremists who introduced the anti-gay measures in the Kansas Legislature this week don’t represent what Kansas is all about. Their efforts are sure to fail, because the rest of the Legislature and the governor are more level-headed. That’s the real Kansas.The bill we’re talking about is an attempt to end the government’s recognition of same-sex marriage. The text of the bill includes this: “The government’s endorsement of LGBTQ ideology has amounted to the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence.” It goes on to say that “so-called marriages that do not involve a man and a woman ... amount to doctrines that are inseparably linked to the religion of secular humanism.”In fact, the bill is an interesting intellectual contortion, attempting to say that the government is promoting a particular religion by endorsing same-sex marriages.

10,Right to Health Care,Should All Americans Have the Right (Be Entitled) to Health Care?,1s10q2r,http://www.dailytargum.com/article/2019/02/we-must-save-title-x-for-health-of-america,SINGH: We must save Title X for health of America |  The Daily Targum,"March 9, 2019 | 27° FTitle X of the Public Health Service Act became a law in the 1970s. This law states that “no American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.” The program has been helping low-income families for decades with family planning and preventative measures. In fact it is the cornerstone of family planning in America as it enables under-served women to gain access to high-quality resources. Some of Title X’s services include wellness exams, birth control, critical cervical and breast cancer screenings, contraception education, as well as testing and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Title X has continuously served effectively to health centers across the country. In 2016 alone, its funding was used to administer 720,000 Pap tests, more than 4 million STD tests and nearly 1 million breast examinations. In 2017, 4 million family planning clients were seen through 6.6 million family planning encounters. As you can see, the mark and usage of Title X is ubiquitous as there are nearly 4,000 health centers in the United States that receive funding from the service. Of all Title X centers, Planned Parenthood services make up only 13 percent, but serve a colossal 41 percent of all Title X patients. This means that preventing patients from receiving care from Title X services also means that many will not be able to go to Planned Parenthood centers either. Although Title X has been powerful in aiding women across the country, social conservatives are not happy with its services, primarily the ones in which Title X uses its own funds to help women with abortions. In June of 2018, the President Donald J. Trump administration appointed Diane Foley to be in charge of Title X activity. One thing to note about Foley is her role as the former chief executive of Life Network, an orthodox Christian group which runs low-quality health centers that have no professional staff as well as no legal licenses to run such clinics. Under Trump’s new Title X administration, there will be several deleterious changes being made to the old Title X. There will be the elimination of many quality family planning services as well as prohibitions of abortion counseling and referrals. The new administration will also compromise the requirement of confidentiality for minors looking for contraception, as well as require women to be referred to prenatal care if she receives a positive for pregnancy, even if she does not want to go through pregnancy. All of these changes only add to the physical and mental stress women are already going through. Family planning is still considered a taboo topic in many areas and without having licensed clinicians to educate them, many women will be forced to put their lives at risk. On Feb. 15, the Senate confirmed William Barr as attorney general. In the past, Barr has shown no support of abortions and in fact rallied against them saying abortion will “ultimately be overturned.” “(Barr’s) appointment only helps to further the Trump administration’s relentless campaign against women’s essential reproductive rights,” said Adrienne Kimmell, vice president of communications for NARAL Pro-Choice America. “Barr’s confirmation is Trump’s latest move to use his administration as a weapon against women and our most fundamental right to control our own bodies and decide our own destinies.”Title X has brought forth significant impact across the nation. It provides affordable birth control that aids in preventing 1 million pregnancies annually. Title X gives women more control over their own lives, provides job and economic security and maintains good health by giving them resources to control their family planning. Title X’s aid does not stop here though, it extends beyond insuring women’s lives by detecting breast and cervical cancer in their early stages. Not only that but this service also helps people screen for STIs and STDs. “For every dollar invested in publicly funded family planning programs like Title X, the government saves $7.09 in Medicaid-related costs. In 2010, state and federal governments saved $13.6 billion from publicly funded family planning programs, including $7 billion from Title X-funded health centers alone,” according to Planned Parenthood Action Fund.Ultimately it is imperative to protect Title X from these changes. It is silly to say this in today’s modern world, but I suppose we are forgetting a rudimentary rule of thumb: each person is entitled to their own body, thus every woman gets to choose what she wants to do with hers. If she chooses to be a mother, then so be it, but if a woman simply is not ready, then there must be a second option for her so that she can choose what she wants to do with her body. Forcing a woman to have a child will only will take a toll on her life when this dilemma can easily be prevented. Taking away the option of abortion restricts and hinders the growth of an individual especially if they do not have the resources to start a family. Changes to Title X will also mean the lack of education for safe practices and preventing pregnancies. We cannot restrict women’s rights. We cannot restrict human rights.

The Federal Communications Commission‘s (FCC) decision to repeal net neutrality in 2017 was criticized by some lawmakers and experts on Thursday afternoon in a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee meeting.Democrats and Republicans on the House of Representative’s communications and technology subcommittee asked questions of a number experts including two former FCC chairmen. Nearly everyone voiced support for an “open internet,” but there were clear partisan divides on what exactly that meant.A number of Democrats, and several experts, called for the restoration of rules of the 2015 Open Internet Act, which was repealed by the Ajit Pai-led FCC. Republicans and other experts argued specifically against inclusion of internet service providers (ISPs) being classified under Title II of the Communications Act as part of the 2015 rules.The panel of experts included former FCC chairs Tom Wheeler and Michael Powell, Free Press’s vice president of strategy and senior counsel Jessica Gonzalez, Mozilla COO Denelle Dixon, CEO of Eastern Oregon Telecom Joseph Franell, and actress and writer Ruth Livier.“I believe this is one of the most important digital rights issues we face today,” said Rep. Mike Doyle (D-Penn.), the subcommittee chairman and sponsor of the House CRA effort last year. “Last year the Pai FCC repealed the 2015 Open Internet Order. Let me be clear: this repeal had far greater impact than just removing the FCC’s net neutrality rules. It was a step back by the FCC from its role as an agency that regulates and oversees internet access and a fundamental shift from all previous FCC chairs who worked to put in place enforceable net neutrality rules and preserve the commission’s vital oversight and consumer protection rules.”The Title II argument was mostly along party lines on Thursday, with Republicans arguing the 2015 Open Internet Order should not have initially classified ISPs under Title II, which lists them as a common carrier rather than an “information service,” which are less regulated under Title I.The 2017 repeal stripped away the Title II classification, which gave the FCC legal authority to enforce the net neutrality protections. If Republicans got their way, ISPs would be classified under Title I, where they were placed before the 2015 order. Republicans argue that the Title II classification is over regulation and can hurt investment, a major piece of evidence Pai used leading up to the FCC’s repeal.In the absence of net neutrality rules in light of the FCC’s repeal, several lawmakers have floated the idea of codifying it in legislation.Last week, Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), who was among those spearheaded an effort last year for Congress to try and overturn the FCC’s vote, said a net neutrality bill would be introduced in the Senate “soon.”On Thursday, it was evident that Democrats would not be the only party pushing net neutrality legislation. However several pro-net neutrality groups have already blasted the Republican proposals.During the hearing several Republicans suggested that legislation in Congress was needed to codify internet rules, but Powell— the former FCC chairman and president of NCTA The Internet & Television Association, a group that represents broadband companies—warned that any hypothetical bipartisan bill would not happen with Title II included.“The old and haggard Title II should not be tucked in under the shimmering cloak of restoring net neutrality protections,” Powell said. “The future of the internet deserves more careful consideration. Moreover a bill that includes Title II will rupture any hope of bipartisan legislation in a divided government, ensuring that for countless more years we will go by without the resolution the public deserves.”Former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler.As Gizmodo reported, Rep. Bob Latta (R-Ohio) is introducing his own bill. During the hearing, Latta said he hoped “this was the year” Congress passed legislation.Other Republicans also voiced support for finding a legislative solution on Thursday, including Rep. Cathy Anne McMorris-Rodgers (R-Wash.), who said she was introducing a bill.It’s expected that ISPs would not be considered under Title II in these bills. That detail was not lost on a number of pro-net neutrality groups on Thursday afternoon.“Despite what the new House minority claims, none of these bills would safeguard net neutrality or internet users’ rights. They would instead undermine the FCC’s ability to protect people online by removing broadband and wireless companies from nearly all agency oversight,” Free Press Action Vice President of Policy and General Counsel Matt Wood said in a statement, later adding: “These industry-written pieces of legislation shouldn’t be taken seriously by any legislator who claims to support net neutrality. Lawmakers need to reject fake compromises. The public overwhelmingly supports real net neutrality and wants to see decisive action to restore all of the essential protections the Pai FCC took away.”Similarly Evan Greer, the deputy director of Fight for the Future, said any legislation would need to codify the 2015 Open Internet Order.“We’ve been tracking these bad faith efforts to push legislation backed by telecom lobbyists for years, and there’s no way people are going to fall for it,” Greer said in a statement. “We need strong legislation that reinstates the FCC rules that never should have been repealed, and doesn’t leave loopholes for Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T to scam us and control what we see online.”READ MORE: Andrew Wyrich is a politics staff writer for the Daily Dot, covering the intersection of politics and the internet.

We are not responsible for them in any way. They've found a warm welcome. In a March survey, 68% of Europeans said they would vote yes in a basic-income referendum, up from 64% last year. I suppose, it depends on how the question is phrased: Would you like to pay higher taxes so that some of it will be given to others even if they do not work?Hell no!Finland, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and the UK already has systems in place to make sure that people doesn't starve or end up homeless.The cost is already there. Switching to UBI doesn't necessarily require higher taxes. Especially since you no longer need government workers investigating who is entitled to extra support.Switching to UBI would change human behavior. For example, I'd probably not have gotten a job after graduating. However, in the long run I'd probably have contributed much more than I'd have cost (and than I contribute now to the local minimum that's called small business).Also note that the welfare systems (and in the case of the Netherlands especially the retirement-""welfare"" (AOW) are increasingly becoming much more difficult to finance due to the aging population. This has in fact caused the government The administrative overhead UBI would save is much smaller than the deficit the existing solutions will ultimately develop. If we want an UBI that does not make us go bankrupt (though by then we'll have great discussions about whether it was UBI or the robots that destroyed us:p), we need to find sustainable financing. And I believe we should look for that in taxing the use of our planet. Land ownership, CO2 exhaust, mining. We could easily make that work (according to my spreadsheet). So, instead of UBI, I As an analogy, we switched to a new travel reimbursement system at work. We routinely waste close to as much money in salary time as we scrape back jumping through the hoops. ""Because someone might abuse it"", we've got micromanaging rules about how and what we can claim. Give us a company credit card, and have one person take a skim through the purchases afterwards. If there are questions, ask them. In the long run, that would likely save a pile of money. ""You charged mileage from the airporFinland, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and the UK already has systems in place to make sure that people doesn't starve or end up homeless.Yes, they all have social welfare.But nope, unlike Netherland and Finland who are or were actually running pilot experiment, Switzerland voted against.Note that Switzerland practice direct democracy. i.e.: no mattter what, the population has always the final say on everything.And in this case, democracy has spoken against UBI: apparently the population was indeed genuinely afraid of rise costs.The cost is already there. Switching to UBI doesn't necessarily require higher taxes. Especially since you no longer need government workers investigating who is entitled to extra support.That is the general idea behind UBI :- keep giving out money as before, under welfare programs.- except now you givUBI is inevitable eventually, I can't predict when, but it is an idea that will have its time.As more and more become automated, more and more jobs will be swallowed up. When robots replaced manufacturing jobs, people moved to service jobs and higher cognitive jobs.As those jobs get taken (they won't all at once- some may be safe for a long time) we will eventually hit a tipping point. A time when a large % of the population is jobless.One of two things will happen,:1) Revolution, the have nots will rise It doesn't make much sense to contribute to a plan that can't actually be implemented unless everyone has to contribute by law.The US will never have single payer healthcare for the same specious argument. So enjoy that bucket of crabs you're in. The US will never have single payer healthcare for the same specious argument. Look how great the single-payer Pension program called Social Security worked out, and is crumbling beneath our feet..... If you need a reason to say the government should get the hell out of Americans' internal economic affairs, and especially healthcare, then no better reason is required.Thet's because too many private companies profit from it. Take those middlemen out and costs become much more modest. If doctors insists on higher bills, don't use those and employ your own doctors.I was born and raised in a country with ""single payer healthcare"" — USSR.Well, that explains a lot. You even put it in quotes, suggesting even you can tell the difference between communism and what we're talking about.What is the difference?What is the difference?There isn't any difference. The socialized medicine in Sweden is not any different in principle from the socialized medicine in Cuba.Cubans have a higher life expectancy than Americans, and a lower infant mortality rate. They accomplish this at FAR lower cost. Healthcare is one of the few things (very few) that Communism actually got right.All countries have economies that are a mixture of socialism and free enterprise. Nearly all countries socialize the roads and sewers. Most socialize basic education Blaming the poor economic situation in Cuba on their socialized healthcare system is a bit silly. The continued cause of their poor economy is more likely rooted in the trade embargo that the USA instituted more than half a century ago.Doesn't really matter if the USSR was never a true Scotsman.The problem is not the ideal version of communism or democracy, it is that human nature never lets the ideal version actually happenThat is not a flaw of socialism, it's a flaw of human nature. And very clearly seen in capitalism as well, for that matter.Yeah, dude, it's tyranny. *rolls eyes* The answer is ... tyranny! Government should use FORCE or the threat of it only as a last resort. We as a country should take up arms against the government, Or the tyranny majority who would try to impose single-payer healthcare and high taxation (relative to historic pre-War US tax percentages) on us.Oh wait.... the damn communists want to take those away, and only allow the government to own guns too.We've already seen the results of those experiments, and they're called North Korea, VenezuWe see the milder form as well, and it's called Europe. And we see the exact opposite, it's called the US. Most Europeans prefer the European system way over the US system.Only about 20% goes to defense, a drop in the bucket compared to entitlements that already exist. Pretty soon we are going to have to reduce some wntitlements to pay for others. Not to mention debt service is already about 1/3 of what we pay for defense. That's only going to continue to rise.Actually, you'd likely get a #10 can of Government Peanut Butter, and a 5 pound block of Government Cheese.Having had some of each. . . .trust me, you don't want either one. Especially the Cheese. . .We are not constantly starting wars anymore, that saves a lot of money. Most war expenses are now when the US persuades our politicians to participate in a war the US started. Which we shouldn't do anymore, if the US wants war, let them pay for it themself.""Would you like to pay higher taxes so that some of it will be given to others even if they do not work?""But we give it to others who steal, lie, and kill though.What do politicians have to do with this issue?Well, socialism always works, until it reaches the Tipping point of collapse, and then it falls apart quickly. Remember the Bernie Sanders' paradise of Venezuela ? Ever wonder why he doesn't speak of it any more? Or Greece, or any number of countries that have tried, and failed at socialism. It always fail, eventually.People are self interested, and socialism fails to account for that. People will choose the easy way until it fails, never learning that value comes from what is hard and rare.Universal Income It assumes most people will find meaninful work, when the reality is, most people won't, especial when taxes start to creep over 50% (feudal tax rate).If you have a UBI of (say) $1000 a month, then earning $5000 a month will be worth it even if you are taxed at 50%. You'll still get an extra $2500 to spend on non-essentials like mobile phones, new trainers, eating out or whatever. UBI is going to pay for basic accommodation, food and other necessities. It isn't going to fund some sort of playboy lifestyle or pay for your kids' holidays or a new car.Greece's economy was ruined by the same idiotic borrow-and-spend, trickle-down tax policies that the American right fawns over, so I don't know why you're using them as an example of socialism failing.Venezuela's economy was too dependent on oil and their economy was bound to eat shit when the price of oil dropped whether they were socialist or corporatocratic. Their failure is simply a failure to diversify their economy.Universal Income doesn't account for everyone not working, when they are promised income for ... ""not working"". It assumes most people will find meaninful work, when the reality is, most people won't, especial when taxes start to creep over 50% (feudal tax rate).There's no problem with people not working when their work is not needed - that's the main reason UBI is being considered, the falling demand for human labor due to automation. As such, UBI does not assume that most people will find meaningful work, but that an ever-increasing fraction of the population will not be able to find work.With a large surplus of labor, there will be no problem filling what jobs are still needed and anyone who doesn't feel like working due to high tax rates should feel free to quit so that someone without such hangups can take their place.You are mistaking communism for socialism.Socialism is nothing but Communism-lite.Here's your basic. You can now live and eat and get healthcare and police and fire service without fear.Nothing prevents you from helping your neighbor — or any other stranger this way. There is absolutely no need for you to compel the rest of us to do the same. Start small, will you not?Please tell me, what happens when half (or more) of the population is on UBI and the other half is taxed to the point of quitting and going on UBI. Let's try this again. At $50,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $40,106 today, and $46,671 under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $42,128 today, and $55,100 under the Universal Social Security. At $200,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $144,620 today, and $145,626 under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $147,865 today, and $155,223 under the Universal Social Security. At $25,000,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $15,138,261 today, and $15,134,880 (-$3,381; this is static after about $500k) under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $15,143,343 today, and $15,143,865 (+$522) under the Universal Social Security. Are you suggesting single filers making over $200k will quit and live on the UBI because of a 0.67% peak increase in total income taxes (something I could buff out easily enough, but I got tired of tweaking the brackets); that single filers making $1M will quit because of a 0.34% increase in total taxes paid; that single filers making $25 million in total compensation will quit because of a 0.014% increase in total income taxes; or that married households making over $500k will quit because they only get about $500 of additional spending money per year? Please specify. Are Europeans suffering rising wealth distribution inequity as much as the US? It seems possible to me that as more people fall into lower wealth percentiles, they become more likely to have a positive view of UBI. Is this a real attitude shift, or merely people feeling they are being left behind? Or, are those even two different things?For the record, as a convicted felon trying to make a new start making $8/hr, I have a very positive view of UBI, but I'm not very sanguine about the economics of it.Most European countries already have systems in place to make sure that people without income doesn't end up starving or homeless.The cost is already there. The point of UBI is to reduce the administrative overhead.Instead of figuring out who needs the extra support you give it to everyone wether they need it or not.For those who didn't need it it will seem redundant that they are first taxed and then have the money given back to them, but in the end nothing much happened.UBI isn't as radical as some people make it out to be.""If we were to give you free money, would you be ok with that?""Although you could put in a minimal volunteer requirement.In particular, some studies have shown that sole income providers do not significantly reduce their work even after getting a basic income, although people do reduce hours for second jobs - whether they be 2nd jobs done after normal working hours or second jobs done by a mother whose husband provides the main income while she takes care of the child.The concept of Basic Income as originally proposed is that it would substitute all other government support programs - social security, old age pension, child support, unemployment insurance - with a single streamlined service. It is not supposed to increase government expenses - it should in fact reduce them by eliminating administrative costs, which is why the idea appealed to those on both the left and the right of the political spectrum. It is the conceptual equivalent of the flat tax, except applied to Be specific. Then we'll figure out how much those programs cost, and weigh that against the cost of a UBI--I guarantee those numbers will not add up. Ready to play?Obviously you havent been paying attention to our education system and media.Let me first point out that I'm in favor of experimentation with UBI because I think that in a decade or two the coming wave of automation will make it both necessary and affordable. But I still find it bizarre that people would say they favor UBI in order to have ""greater financial independence and self-reliance"". What? In what way does UBI give you greater financial independence or self-reliance? Relying on government payouts, funded by taxes collected from others, is not independence except in the narrow Well - you have more financial independence because you know that at least part of your income will be steady.That is the ""narrowest possible sense"" to which I referred.> you know that at least part of your income will be steadyUntil the next election following implementation of UBI. Then you'll be scrambling looking for a job [along with several million other people] while you have ""smoked pot in Mom's basement"" on your resume for the previous 4 years. Good luck with that.I'd love to dive into the financials to see how it would work here in the states.Above I posted a blurb where I did a quick google and got an estimate that our social welfare programs seemed to be on the order of about $10B/year in administrative costs. That's $30/person in the US. Not anywhere near enough savings to make UBI possible, even if you saved it all. Looks like we collect about $2.6T in income and payroll taxes at the federal level in the US every year. Divided by 360M people that's a bit over $7,000 per person per year. If you give that to infants and children, thatWhat I find seriously disconcerting is that only 48% wanted to pilot-test the nationwide gamechanging life-altering economy-revamping policy before implementing it!Exactly. This appears to be a flaw with these ""trial runs"". They are choosing a limited number of recipients, but if the government is pulling from the entire population to fund the trial, then it won't be modelling the obvious problem. Perhaps this addressed in some of the experiments, but not the ones that I've read about.I'm not an expert, but some observations:One of the goals of UBI is to make welfare cheaper - less administrative overhead, less hospitalization. So it may not be apples-to-apples when you're comparing before with after.Another goal is to enable low-paid workes to get a job which increases the tax base.Say Joe Schmuck can't find a job in the current economy, nobody's going to pay him the $20 USD/hour it takes for him to survive. Now the government steps in and pays him this, and suddently he might accept $1 Or am I missing something?Yes, it works better with 3 to 5 hundred million people. And without the present day hoarding of capital by a small pack of gluttons that we allow to run our governments, financing would be trivial.Doesn't have to be 85% - 50% will do. And they don't have to be okay with it. They can whine all they want as long as they don't have the ability to buy votes. I'm not necessarily for or against it, but I think the economics would work out if people at the top didn't care so much about things like gold-plated fixtures in their NY high-rises.Some of it is supposed to be paid for by eliminating the enormous welfare bureaucracy associated with the alphabet soup of individual welfare programs, the means testing, the monitoring, etc.Just because $1 in tax money goes into a welfare program does not mean that $1 in benefits was received by a recipient. Much of that $1 went into the budgets, salaries and operations involved in running that program.With UBI you eliminate all of that. You get a check and the progressive tax code decides whether it's net positive for you when your total income (UBI + wages) goes above the income level of benefits eligibility.In fact, I think it makes sense if a person gets $25,000 UBI, makes $5,000 working that they should somehow net out something more than $25,000 and less than $30,000. We want people to have an incentive to keep working, and not losing all benefits because of *any* work goes a long way to providing that incentive. A big problem with many current welfare programs is the complexity of means testing and the games people play to get benefits though they don't qualify or to kill work incentives so they continue to get benefits.No, it must be that people at the top of the income scale are taxed (in a sliding proportion up the scale of course) to pay for the people at the bottom of the scale who aren't making any income that can be taxed? The guy making $1M at the top of society gets taxed 50% to fund 16 people at the bottom who get the basic income and don't have income to be taxed. The 2nd guy making $900k gets taxed 40% to pay for 12 people earning the basic income, etc. etc. and down the scale. How else would it work?One other way it could work is to not even have the sliding scale: everyone gets $30,000 and pays a flat X% tax on all additional income. Set X to the number of your choice, e.g. at 40%, the person earning $75K/yr is at the neutral point, everyone earning less sees some benefit, everyone earning more funds the program to some extent. It's actually not a terrible tax system: it's just two numbers, the BI and X%, and a dollar earned is worth the same to everyone in terms of money kept.Yes. A flat tax is not regressive when combined with an appropriate level of a fixed distribution, it is instead a smooth progressive tax.The numbers I started off with as a rough estimate are $2000/yr ($400 for dependent children), 50% flat tax (personal and business), 25% VAT. Eliminate welfare, unemployment, SNAP, etc. Keep SS for now but phase out slowly. Add Universal Healthcare. Eliminate taxes on dividends, capital gains, but add in a day-trader/high-speed trading transaction tax. Eliminate min So this is basically a large wealth transfer (which all taxes in principle are), not some utopian new idea that somehow pays for itself, right?Absolutely. However, it's a less invasive, less condescending, less costly and more scalable and likely less economically distortive approach to doing exactly what welfare systems do now. To start with, assume that instead of $30K we set the UBI at what traditional means-tested welfare typically pays people now, then (a) pay that to everyone and (b) increase taxes to cover it. For most people, on average, this will result in no net change. You'll get UBI checks of, say, $1K per month, but your taxes will in Or am I missing something?Nope, other than that something like this becomes a must in order to avoid the need-based uprising of the masses.Thanks to automation, we're quickly reaching the point in many industries where employing people to do your work is a money-losing operation. Once it becomes unprofitable to employ people, those unemployed people will, by necessity, require some other way to supply their needs. If they don't have it, you'll have backed them into a corner, with a violent uprising being one of their few means for r I mean, if it's not universal, than it's not a Universal Basic Income.I could see doing it on a regional basis -- but you'd have to be kind of a hard-ass about it and be fairly committed to it.Restrict it to only residents of the region at the time it started. Actually dismantle that region's regular welfare system, so you know exactly what cost savings you are gaining. I don't see either of those as being easy or palatable.Which seems to be the major problem with a UBI -- you can model the shit out of it and say it makes sense, but until you do it -- and make it Universal -- you don't know.And it still leaves a lot of uncomfortable questions -- what about immigrants? How long are they there until they're eligible? Diverse welfare payments are easier in that situation, because you can say ""well, immigrants should get housing and job training, but not actual unemployment payments"" or however you slice it.FWIW, I think a negative income tax type of UBI makes sense, especially if it allows for marginal, low-wage employment without completely eliminating UBI payments (they should get zeroed out by taxes, but only once income rises above some level greater than UBI itself). I think providing people an incentive to work, even at low wage jobs (ie, more total income) makes sense, and would have a lot of positive impacts on working conditions. Low wage employers wouldn't be able to treat workers like slaves because homelessness and starvation wouldn't be the alternatives.The participants to the pilot were selected randomly from the population of Finland. It is not limited to a region. This way they represent all social classes. After some years the people in the pilot are compared to others who were in the same situation as the pilot started.The problems with immigration etc. already exist in our current system, so we most likely already have solutions for them.What happens if you start a company that does not yet make any money? Do you lose all the benefits? What about full time students? At least our current system has all kinds of holes you can fall in to unless you are careful.The poverty threshold, poverty limit or poverty line is the minimum level of income deemed adequate to cover total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year. In the US, this is presented as an income level based on household size (number of dependents). For a single person household, the poverty line is $12,060 (2017).Perhaps worth noting is that a single person household working a full-time minimum-wage job exceeds the poverty line (50 weeks time 40 hours times $7.25 is $14,500), so by definition a full-time minimum wage worker is not living in poverty. But if that same person has a child, then both are living in poverty, as the poverty line for a two-person household is $16,240. In a very real albeit statistical sense, children cause poverty.An assumption of a UBI is that it provides sufficient income to survive on, so let's use the poverty line as the basis for the UBI. That is, a single person household would receive a UBI of $12,060; A two-person household would receive a UBI of $16,240; and so on. Note that even this basic assumption leads to perverse outcomes (e.g. two adults living separately would get $12,060 each, but if they live together they ""lose"" $7,880 in UBI), so at least some will avoid getting married, or even living together (or lie about living together, thereby defrauding the system) just to maximize their free money.Using census data, there are 124.5 million households. The average household size is 2.54 people. Let's interpolate the poverty table to get an average expected UBI of about $18,497. Multiplying that out we can get the tab for providing UBI based on these assumptions, a total of about $2.303 trillion.Coincidentally, that is almost exactly the amount of money we currently spend on all social welfare benefits programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, foodstamps, etc. A reasonable idea--indeed, this was put forward in a WSJ essay by Charles Murray--would be to eliminate all those programs in favor of the UBI. Of course, this ignores the howls that would arise from a populace deprived of their SS checks and foodstamps.Exploring the notion of replacing the most basic welfare programs, e.g. foodstamps, section 8 housing, while not disrupting the SS and Medicare that the elderly view as an earned right. After all, the UBI based on poverty level should by definition cover those sorts of expenses. There will still be screams from people concerned about drug addicts not buying food for their kids and that sort of thing. So it seems unlikely that the overhead of those programs, let alone the programs, would be completely done away with.So it seems almost a certainty that a UBI would be adjacent to at least SS/Medicare. Those totaled about $1.473T of the welfare expenditures, so add the $2.303 to the SS/Medicare $1.473T for a total cost of $3.776T. Perhaps the UBI reduces SS income dollar-for-dollar in an either-or situation reduces this a bit.A worst-case cost would be adding UBI on top of all the existing programs, for a total cost of about $5T. Or perhaps the UBI in lieu of all other programs can actually be rammed through so that the cost remains a minimum of $2.303T.Total federal revenues collected from all sources (taxes, royalties, etc.) in 2014 (last year available) was $3.27 trillion. So UBI would consume somewhere north of 70% of all federal revenues. And the math here assumes that no one receive UBI drops out of the workforce or reduces their taxable income at all--i.e., that revenues stay constant.Your numbers match roughly with the ones I crunched above, working the other direction. I took our $2.6T annual income and payroll taxes and divided them up among the population of the US. That came to about $7k/person annually, which would be $14k for a single parent and kid, and $28k for a family of four. And that is essentially the poverty line currently. As you noted, with $3.3T of total federal revenues, there isn't much left over once you do UBI. Certainly not enough to to stack UBI with anythUntil it runs out.... See Greece and Venezuela if you don't believe me. OR...Those who rob Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Peter.... What do you do when, say, 50 or 60 percent of the workforce is only capable of doing jobs that aren't profitable to pay people to do anymore? I don't think that you're going to be able to instantly break the cycle of ""work--earn--consume"" that has driven life since forever. Telling people who have spent their lives saving for retirement or amassing wealth that their money is no longer useful in the way it once was isn't going to go well.In my opinion, most people who say people who want a universal income in place are lazy freeloaders who just want to sit around all day haven't worked with a large cross-section of humanity. They work as IT people, or developers/engineers, or doctors, or some other profession that requires a lot of education and are surrounded by smart people all day long. Out in the rest of the world, there exist people who can't handle anything more than a menial job. You don't just turn paper filers and customer service people into data scientists and biochemists. The job-replacement train ran out of gas a while back. It worked well when it was farming, then factory work, then corporate factory-style work like clerical/secretary work, then service jobs. Once those service jobs are gone, what high-salary, low-requirement job replaces them? Economies are built around consumers having a good job, taking on debt, spending, and keeping that cycle going. Universal income would allow this cycle to continue for a little longer, allowing employers to pay people less but keep them employed if they wished to earn beyond the minimum income. It basically buys us time to figure out how to deal with what could end up being massive unemployment and poverty for a formerly stable portion of the first-world workforce.We lack the willpower to let those who mismanage their UBI payments die in the streets. Lots of people are poor because they lack the capacity to plan ahead. Not all, of course, but many. Those people are going to waste their UBI payments, and we will not be willing to let them starve or die of exposure. So, we will either add a new government program to spend their money wisely instead of letting them waste it, or we'll recreate the same old system of free housing and food stamps that we have now, just There are places in the US where you would make less money working than you would on welfare. And since basically any kind of income can disqualify you from welfare, not only is work discouraged buyt working your way up is discouraged as well. Basically, since welfare isn’t on any kind of sliding scale, it actively discourages working.UBI would be abused. For sure. But if you’re not at risk of losing the income, then plenty of people will get part time jobs just to deal with the boredom.Maybe a bunch of the rest of them will spend their free time making more minecraft videos for youtube. (Did you know that there are a lot of people who make a comfortable living just playing video games and recording them for youtube? Amazing. This one guy Mumbo owns a Merc!)What I’d like to know is how much the welfare system, with all of its admin overhead, costs that doesn’t go to people’s welfare checks. Compare that to the admin overhead of just issuing everyone a check. Of course, different places have different costs of living, and that complicates things too, because it’s hard to work out what’s fair and equal. Basically, since welfare isn’t on any kind of sliding scale, it actively discourages working.That's why some UBI implementations call for a negative income rate for the bottom x% of the population. If you don't work you get your max UBI, but the more you make the less UBI you get. Done correctly, for every $1000 you make you only use $500 in UBI, so there's always an incentive to work on top of UBI. What I’d like to know is how much the welfare system, with all of its admin overhead, costs that doesn’t go to people’s welfare checks.My spitballing above put it at about $10T or about $30/person in the US/year for administrative costs currently. Not enough to fund UBI in the least. Oh, and new Mercedes can be had for $30k nowI'm actually all for UBI, provided they kill the minimum wage and a bunch of social programs along with it. It would increase efficiency overall, be a boon to small employers and their employees, and raise the standard of living for the lower 50%.The problem will be when able bodied people decide to live only on UBI and nothing else. That's detrimental to society and a mechanism should be put in place to prevent that.Smoking pot in your parents' basement and collecting a check from the government to pay for your weed and doritos is not a valid occupation.It depends on your definition of ""should"" What percentage of the population is happy to live in poverty, but be able to afford the basics of bills, and scrape by? is that small % of the population worth worrying about?Also so far as I have seen the proposed basic incomes would not allow what you to do what you are talking about. The UBI is typically household based, so living with your parents would negate it.I'd be happy if the paupers receiving public assistance were not allowed to vote while at it... But somehow this is anathema to most people.Any increases in the standard of living will be negated by an equal increase in the cost of living. Good intentions don't overcome fundamental laws of economics.Smoking pot in your parents' basement and collecting a check from the government to pay for your weed and doritos is not a valid occupation.Why not?   And I'm somewhat serious. Yes, it offends your puritanical mindset, but what jobs are you creating for the folks who would lean this way? Used to be, half the population or more was involved in agriculture. Now we're under 2%, and we produce more food than ever before. We make so much food that we can't get eat it fast enough. We export food around the world. With a little better distribution and a bit of planning, we could feed everyone in the US handily, based on the food waste we throw out. We have technologically ended hunger, and are only waiting on the social and governmental structures needed to truly end it.   One major problem down. There is really no reason for that couch potato to starve, because we could feed them on our food waste at no real extra cost. Millions of them.   The rise of wind and solar and the massive uptick in natural gas is driving energy costs lower and lower. We used to employ millions and millions in energy-related businesses, but those are increasingly automated. And another major problem being mitigated. When it's trivial and inexpensive to keep the lights and heat on for that basement dweller, why would we not do that?   ""Work or die"" has been a reality for most all of human history. But there's no compelling reason for it to remain a reality. Give me UBI, and I'm not going to stay home. I want more. I might, however, take 6 months off to finish the novel I've been working on for years. I might see if I can push some of my hobbies and business ideas into real businesses. UBI would give me the safety net to take those risks. Will some people use it to sit in their parents' basement and smoke weed? Sure. And if they do, why should you or I or anyone else care? It's not like we don't have the resources to keep them alive.Rich people tend to want to live in nice places, and generally have the extra money to pay for that privilege. Living in a place with good schools, good health care, and a good safety net creates the type of society where the wealthy and upper middle class want to live. The lower crime alone which comes from these services is arguably worth it.You don't see too many rich people leaving for third world countries just because the taxes are lower. You may see some middle class people moving to Thailand to make their retirement money stretch, but those with real wealth paying most of the taxes tend to desire well countries with the powerful governments necessary to run a modern society. And they have the money to pay for it.Rich people tend to want to live in nice places,EVERYONE wants to live in nice places! and generally have the extra money to pay for that privilege. And that's what separates it. No one wants to live in the ghetto, or the rough neighbourhoods (not even the roughs). Almost everyone would move to a nice place where they are safe, have good schools for their kids, and nice amenities... IF they could.Serious question. If you made UBI, which is income that is BARELY enough to scrape by, without being able to afford anything else but scraping by, are you seriously going to stop working and stop making the money needed for things outside of bare necessities?The whole ""people will stop working if you pay for their bare needs"" argument is a massive lie. You may have increased worry over under the table jobs, but people are not going to stop working, just like they dont generally stop working on welfare, beca Who says? And you are saying that those low paid workers would not keep their jobs to actually be able to do more with more income?In addition with the increased money in peoples hands you would actually see larger demand, and more economic growth from a demand spike.Pulling money out one end and putting it in the other does not actually improve the economy. Even if it benefits restaurant owners at the expense of other taxpayers.people are not going to stop workingNot true. There have been many UBI pilot programs [wikipedia.org] and they all found that some people stopped working. Other people worked fewer hours. Even more common was that two-earner households became one-earner households. Women with young children are the most likely to drop out of the labor force.Even more common was that two-earner households became one-earner households. Women with young children are the most likely to drop out of the labor force.Isn't this the way it used to be back in the days when America was Great. You know, how we're supposedly trying to Make it Again?The difference is, back then one earner could provide a middle-class life for a family. Nowdays, two earners barely provide a working class life, and that's with at least one working 2-3 jobs.Meantime, the stuff you really need like housing (whether you own or rent), food, and drugs are dramatically costlier than they were in the old days.Wrong. Housing costs have barely changed [aei.org] when measured by the square foot and adjusted for inflation. Food is far cheaper today [npr.org] than it was 40 years ago. Drugs are also cheaper today if you buy the same drugs.It is not an ""all or nothing"". The fact acknowledged by TFA itself is that people receiving assistance begin working less than they used to.This is not true in the least. First of all the survey asked what they WOULD do. That is speculation, and only 3% surveyed said they would stop working, which would probably end when they realize the amount would not even pay their rent.... 8% said less, but how much less are we talking about, without numbers you really cant point out the problem.And they are happy to have others help them pay for it...Please point out, mathematically, how say 960 euros a month (the Netherlands experiment) would be able to pay for rent/mortgage, a car, food, utilities, vacation, This is not true in the least.What I said is entirely true — although few people (TFA cites 3%) would stop working completely — the strawman you put up initially — many will work less. TFA says so: Trials during the 1970s in Canada and the US found people worked slightly less and The Dalia survey, similarly, found most people said they would spend more time with family, volunteering, or training. So, 3% would stop working completely, and ""most people"" would work less. Just as I said.howSo it is Basic Income that does not meet the Basic needs?How long will that last before they are screaming for a raise?It is not an ""all or nothing"". The fact acknowledged by TFA itself is that people receiving assistance begin working less than they used to. You mean less than 96 hours? Oh, right, you're a child. You grew up with the eight-hour day [wikipedia.org]. Sorry, I forgot, most people haven't had the adults educate them about work yet. So let's start with how lazy and entitled you little shits are. First off, back in the 1830s, your kind were already crying out about how utterly lazy they were and how the government should fix it so they don't have to work. ""From six to six"", they used to say. Twelve hours--twelve hours--and with two full hours of meal breaks!Libertarian does not mean what you think it means.Yes and no. People who don't need to work look down on those who do. People who work look down on people who need to, but don't.Important reminder: This is intended as a REPLACEMENT for other programs, like job insurance, retirement programs, family income programs, etc. It drastically reduces the need for a bulk of social services for healthy adults, and allows better specialized uses of resources for those who can't take care of themselves.It's a LOT cheaper to identify taxpayers, prevent duplication and simply send a regular stipend, than it costs to manage all those separate programs.Also, government IS the people, and in this c > This is intended as a REPLACEMENT for other programs, like job insurance, retirement programs, family income programs, etcTo the first order, $0 is spent on ""job insurance"" and ""family income programs"".

With UBI you could at least study with the UBI, now you lose unemployment benefits if you study full time.It won't even work then...

Especially since you no longer need government workers investigating who is entitled to extra support.Switching to UBI would change human behavior. For example, I'd probably not have gotten a job after graduating. However, in the long run I'd probably have contributed much more than I'd have cost (and than I contribute now to the local minimum that's called small business).Also note that the welfare systems (and in the case of the Netherlands especially the retirement-""welfare"" (AOW) are increasingly becoming much more difficult to finance due to the aging population. This has in fact caused the government The administrative overhead UBI would save is much smaller than the deficit the existing solutions will ultimately develop. If we want an UBI that does not make us go bankrupt (though by then we'll have great discussions about whether it was UBI or the robots that destroyed us:p), we need to find sustainable financing. And I believe we should look for that in taxing the use of our planet. Land ownership, CO2 exhaust, mining. We could easily make that work (according to my spreadsheet). So, instead of UBI, I As an analogy, we switched to a new travel reimbursement system at work. We routinely waste close to as much money in salary time as we scrape back jumping through the hoops. ""Because someone might abuse it"", we've got micromanaging rules about how and what we can claim. Give us a company credit card, and have one person take a skim through the purchases afterwards.

So enjoy that bucket of crabs you're in. The US will never have single payer healthcare for the same specious argument. Look how great the single-payer Pension program called Social Security worked out, and is crumbling beneath our feet..... If you need a reason to say the government should get the hell out of Americans' internal economic affairs, and especially healthcare, then no better reason is required.Thet's because too many private companies profit from it. Take those middlemen out and costs become much more modest. If doctors insists on higher bills, don't use those and employ your own doctors.I was born and raised in a country with ""single payer healthcare"" — USSR.Well, that explains a lot. You even put it in quotes, suggesting even you can tell the difference between communism and what we're talking about.What is the difference?What is the difference?There isn't any difference. The socialized medicine in Sweden is not any different in principle from the socialized medicine in Cuba.Cubans have a higher life expectancy than Americans, and a lower infant mortality rate. They accomplish this at FAR lower cost. Healthcare is one of the few things (very few) that Communism actually got right.All countries have economies that are a mixture of socialism and free enterprise. Nearly all countries socialize the roads and sewers. Most socialize basic education Blaming the poor economic situation in Cuba on their socialized healthcare system is a bit silly. The continued cause of their poor economy is more likely rooted in the trade embargo that the USA instituted more than half a century ago.Doesn't really matter if the USSR was never a true Scotsman.The problem is not the ideal version of communism or democracy, it is that human nature never lets the ideal version actually happenThat is not a flaw of socialism, it's a flaw of human nature.

Remember the Bernie Sanders' paradise of Venezuela ? Ever wonder why he doesn't speak of it any more? Or Greece, or any number of countries that have tried, and failed at socialism. It always fail, eventually.People are self interested, and socialism fails to account for that. People will choose the easy way until it fails, never learning that value comes from what is hard and rare.Universal Income It assumes most people will find meaninful work, when the reality is, most people won't, especial when taxes start to creep over 50% (feudal tax rate).If you have a UBI of (say) $1000 a month, then earning $5000 a month will be worth it even if you are taxed at 50%. You'll still get an extra $2500 to spend on non-essentials like mobile phones, new trainers, eating out or whatever. UBI is going to pay for basic accommodation, food and other necessities. It isn't going to fund some sort of playboy lifestyle or pay for your kids' holidays or a new car.Greece's economy was ruined by the same idiotic borrow-and-spend, trickle-down tax policies that the American right fawns over, so I don't know why you're using them as an example of socialism failing.Venezuela's economy was too dependent on oil and their economy was bound to eat shit when the price of oil dropped whether they were socialist or corporatocratic. Their failure is simply a failure to diversify their economy.Universal Income doesn't account for everyone not working, when they are promised income for ... ""not working"". It assumes most people will find meaninful work, when the reality is, most people won't, especial when taxes start to creep over 50% (feudal tax rate).There's no problem with people not working when their work is not needed - that's the main reason UBI is being considered, the falling demand for human labor due to automation. As such, UBI does not assume that most people will find meaningful work, but that an ever-increasing fraction of the population will not be able to find work.With a large surplus of labor, there will be no problem filling what jobs are still needed and anyone who doesn't feel like working due to high tax rates should feel free to quit so that someone without such hangups can take their place.You are mistaking communism for socialism.Socialism is nothing but Communism-lite.Here's your basic. You can now live and eat and get healthcare and police and fire service without fear.Nothing prevents you from helping your neighbor — or any other stranger this way. There is absolutely no need for you to compel the rest of us to do the same. Start small, will you not?Please tell me, what happens when half (or more) of the population is on UBI and the other half is taxed to the point of quitting and going on UBI. Let's try this again. At $50,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $40,106 today, and $46,671 under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $42,128 today, and $55,100 under the Universal Social Security. At $200,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $144,620 today, and $145,626 under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $147,865 today, and $155,223 under the Universal Social Security. At $25,000,000 of gross income, a 1-adult household takes home $15,138,261 today, and $15,134,880 (-$3,381; this is static after about $500k) under the Universal Social Security. A 2-adult, married household takes home $15,143,343 today, and $15,143,865 (+$522) under the Universal Social Security. Are you suggesting single filers making over $200k will quit and live on the UBI because of a 0.67% peak increase in total income taxes (something I could buff out easily enough, but I got tired of tweaking the brackets); that single filers making $1M will quit because of a 0.34% increase in total taxes paid; that single filers making $25 million in total compensation will quit because of a 0.014% increase in total income taxes; or that married households making over $500k will quit because they only get about $500 of additional spending money per year? Please specify. Are Europeans suffering rising wealth distribution inequity as much as the US? It seems possible to me that as more people fall into lower wealth percentiles, they become more likely to have a positive view of UBI. Is this a real attitude shift, or merely people feeling they are being left behind? Or, are those even two different things?For the record, as a convicted felon trying to make a new start making $8/hr, I have a very positive view of UBI, but I'm not very sanguine about the economics of it.Most European countries already have systems in place to make sure that people without income doesn't end up starving or homeless.The cost is already there. The point of UBI is to reduce the administrative overhead.Instead of figuring out who needs the extra support you give it to everyone wether they need it or not.For those who didn't need it it will seem redundant that they are first taxed and then have the money given back to them, but in the end nothing much happened.UBI isn't as radical as some people make it out to be.""If we were to give you free money, would you be ok with that?""Although you could put in a minimal volunteer requirement.In particular, some studies have shown that sole income providers do not significantly reduce their work even after getting a basic income, although people do reduce hours for second jobs - whether they be 2nd jobs done after normal working hours or second jobs done by a mother whose husband provides the main income while she takes care of the child.The concept of Basic Income as originally proposed is that it would substitute all other government support programs - social security, old age pension, child support, unemployment insurance - with a single streamlined service. It is not supposed to increase government expenses - it should in fact reduce them by eliminating administrative costs, which is why the idea appealed to those on both the left and the right of the political spectrum. It is the conceptual equivalent of the flat tax, except applied to Be specific. Then we'll figure out how much those programs cost, and weigh that against the cost of a UBI--I guarantee those numbers will not add up. Ready to play?Obviously you havent been paying attention to our education system and media.Let me first point out that I'm in favor of experimentation with UBI because I think that in a decade or two the coming wave of automation will make it both necessary and affordable. But I still find it bizarre that people would say they favor UBI in order to have ""greater financial independence and self-reliance"". What? In what way does UBI give you greater financial independence or self-reliance? Relying on government payouts, funded by taxes collected from others, is not independence except in the narrow Well - you have more financial independence because you know that at least part of your income will be steady.That is the ""narrowest possible sense"" to which I referred.> you know that at least part of your income will be steadyUntil the next election following implementation of UBI. Then you'll be scrambling looking for a job [along with several million other people] while you have ""smoked pot in Mom's basement"" on your resume for the previous 4 years. Good luck with that.I'd love to dive into the financials to see how it would work here in the states.Above I posted a blurb where I did a quick google and got an estimate that our social welfare programs seemed to be on the order of about $10B/year in administrative costs. That's $30/person in the US. Not anywhere near enough savings to make UBI possible, even if you saved it all. Looks like we collect about $2.6T in income and payroll taxes at the federal level in the US every year. Divided by 360M people that's a bit over $7,000 per person per year. If you give that to infants and children, thatWhat I find seriously disconcerting is that only 48% wanted to pilot-test the nationwide gamechanging life-altering economy-revamping policy before implementing it!Exactly. This appears to be a flaw with these ""trial runs"". They are choosing a limited number of recipients, but if the government is pulling from the entire population to fund the trial, then it won't be modelling the obvious problem. Perhaps this addressed in some of the experiments, but not the ones that I've read about.I'm not an expert, but some observations:One of the goals of UBI is to make welfare cheaper - less administrative overhead, less hospitalization. So it may not be apples-to-apples when you're comparing before with after.Another goal is to enable low-paid workes to get a job which increases the tax base.Say Joe Schmuck can't find a job in the current economy, nobody's going to pay him the $20 USD/hour it takes for him to survive. Now the government steps in and pays him this, and suddently he might accept $1 Or am I missing something?Yes, it works better with 3 to 5 hundred million people. And without the present day hoarding of capital by a small pack of gluttons that we allow to run our governments, financing would be trivial.Doesn't have to be 85% - 50% will do. And they don't have to be okay with it. They can whine all they want as long as they don't have the ability to buy votes. I'm not necessarily for or against it, but I think the economics would work out if people at the top didn't care so much about things like gold-plated fixtures in their NY high-rises.Some of it is supposed to be paid for by eliminating the enormous welfare bureaucracy associated with the alphabet soup of individual welfare programs, the means testing, the monitoring, etc.Just because $1 in tax money goes into a welfare program does not mean that $1 in benefits was received by a recipient. Much of that $1 went into the budgets, salaries and operations involved in running that program.With UBI you eliminate all of that. You get a check and the progressive tax code decides whether it's net positive for you when your total income (UBI + wages) goes above the income level of benefits eligibility.In fact, I think it makes sense if a person gets $25,000 UBI, makes $5,000 working that they should somehow net out something more than $25,000 and less than $30,000. We want people to have an incentive to keep working, and not losing all benefits because of *any* work goes a long way to providing that incentive. A big problem with many current welfare programs is the complexity of means testing and the games people play to get benefits though they don't qualify or to kill work incentives so they continue to get benefits.No, it must be that people at the top of the income scale are taxed (in a sliding proportion up the scale of course) to pay for the people at the bottom of the scale who aren't making any income that can be taxed? The guy making $1M at the top of society gets taxed 50% to fund 16 people at the bottom who get the basic income and don't have income to be taxed. The 2nd guy making $900k gets taxed 40% to pay for 12 people earning the basic income, etc. etc. and down the scale. How else would it work?One other way it could work is to not even have the sliding scale: everyone gets $30,000 and pays a flat X% tax on all additional income. Set X to the number of your choice, e.g. at 40%, the person earning $75K/yr is at the neutral point, everyone earning less sees some benefit, everyone earning more funds the program to some extent. It's actually not a terrible tax system: it's just two numbers, the BI and X%, and a dollar earned is worth the same to everyone in terms of money kept.Yes. A flat tax is not regressive when combined with an appropriate level of a fixed distribution, it is instead a smooth progressive tax.The numbers I started off with as a rough estimate are $2000/yr ($400 for dependent children), 50% flat tax (personal and business), 25% VAT. Eliminate welfare, unemployment, SNAP, etc. Keep SS for now but phase out slowly. Add Universal Healthcare. Eliminate taxes on dividends, capital gains, but add in a day-trader/high-speed trading transaction tax. Eliminate min So this is basically a large wealth transfer (which all taxes in principle are), not some utopian new idea that somehow pays for itself, right?Absolutely. However, it's a less invasive, less condescending, less costly and more scalable and likely less economically distortive approach to doing exactly what welfare systems do now. To start with, assume that instead of $30K we set the UBI at what traditional means-tested welfare typically pays people now, then (a) pay that to everyone and (b) increase taxes to cover it. For most people, on average, this will result in no net change. You'll get UBI checks of, say, $1K per month, but your taxes will in Or am I missing something?Nope, other than that something like this becomes a must in order to avoid the need-based uprising of the masses.Thanks to automation, we're quickly reaching the point in many industries where employing people to do your work is a money-losing operation. Once it becomes unprofitable to employ people, those unemployed people will, by necessity, require some other way to supply their needs. If they don't have it, you'll have backed them into a corner, with a violent uprising being one of their few means for r I mean, if it's not universal, than it's not a Universal Basic Income.I could see doing it on a regional basis -- but you'd have to be kind of a hard-ass about it and be fairly committed to it.Restrict it to only residents of the region at the time it started. Actually dismantle that region's regular welfare system, so you know exactly what cost savings you are gaining. I don't see either of those as being easy or palatable.Which seems to be the major problem with a UBI -- you can model the shit out of it and say it makes sense, but until you do it -- and make it Universal -- you don't know.And it still leaves a lot of uncomfortable questions -- what about immigrants? How long are they there until they're eligible? Diverse welfare payments are easier in that situation, because you can say ""well, immigrants should get housing and job training, but not actual unemployment payments"" or however you slice it.FWIW, I think a negative income tax type of UBI makes sense, especially if it allows for marginal, low-wage employment without completely eliminating UBI payments (they should get zeroed out by taxes, but only once income rises above some level greater than UBI itself). I think providing people an incentive to work, even at low wage jobs (ie, more total income) makes sense, and would have a lot of positive impacts on working conditions. Low wage employers wouldn't be able to treat workers like slaves because homelessness and starvation wouldn't be the alternatives.The participants to the pilot were selected randomly from the population of Finland. It is not limited to a region. This way they represent all social classes. After some years the people in the pilot are compared to others who were in the same situation as the pilot started.The problems with immigration etc. already exist in our current system, so we most likely already have solutions for them.What happens if you start a company that does not yet make any money? Do you lose all the benefits? What about full time students? At least our current system has all kinds of holes you can fall in to unless you are careful.The poverty threshold, poverty limit or poverty line is the minimum level of income deemed adequate to cover total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year. In the US, this is presented as an income level based on household size (number of dependents). For a single person household, the poverty line is $12,060 (2017).Perhaps worth noting is that a single person household working a full-time minimum-wage job exceeds the poverty line (50 weeks time 40 hours times $7.25 is $14,500), so by definition a full-time minimum wage worker is not living in poverty. But if that same person has a child, then both are living in poverty, as the poverty line for a two-person household is $16,240. In a very real albeit statistical sense, children cause poverty.An assumption of a UBI is that it provides sufficient income to survive on, so let's use the poverty line as the basis for the UBI. That is, a single person household would receive a UBI of $12,060; A two-person household would receive a UBI of $16,240; and so on. Note that even this basic assumption leads to perverse outcomes (e.g. two adults living separately would get $12,060 each, but if they live together they ""lose"" $7,880 in UBI), so at least some will avoid getting married, or even living together (or lie about living together, thereby defrauding the system) just to maximize their free money.Using census data, there are 124.5 million households. The average household size is 2.54 people. Let's interpolate the poverty table to get an average expected UBI of about $18,497. Multiplying that out we can get the tab for providing UBI based on these assumptions, a total of about $2.303 trillion.Coincidentally, that is almost exactly the amount of money we currently spend on all social welfare benefits programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, foodstamps, etc. A reasonable idea--indeed, this was put forward in a WSJ essay by Charles Murray--would be to eliminate all those programs in favor of the UBI. Of course, this ignores the howls that would arise from a populace deprived of their SS checks and foodstamps.Exploring the notion of replacing the most basic welfare programs, e.g. foodstamps, section 8 housing, while not disrupting the SS and Medicare that the elderly view as an earned right. After all, the UBI based on poverty level should by definition cover those sorts of expenses. There will still be screams from people concerned about drug addicts not buying food for their kids and that sort of thing. So it seems unlikely that the overhead of those programs, let alone the programs, would be completely done away with.So it seems almost a certainty that a UBI would be adjacent to at least SS/Medicare. Those totaled about $1.473T of the welfare expenditures, so add the $2.303 to the SS/Medicare $1.473T for a total cost of $3.776T. Perhaps the UBI reduces SS income dollar-for-dollar in an either-or situation reduces this a bit.A worst-case cost would be adding UBI on top of all the existing programs, for a total cost of about $5T. Or perhaps the UBI in lieu of all other programs can actually be rammed through so that the cost remains a minimum of $2.303T.Total federal revenues collected from all sources (taxes, royalties, etc.) in 2014 (last year available) was $3.27 trillion. So UBI would consume somewhere north of 70% of all federal revenues. And the math here assumes that no one receive UBI drops out of the workforce or reduces their taxable income at all--i.e., that revenues stay constant.Your numbers match roughly with the ones I crunched above, working the other direction. I took our $2.6T annual income and payroll taxes and divided them up among the population of the US. That came to about $7k/person annually, which would be $14k for a single parent and kid, and $28k for a family of four. And that is essentially the poverty line currently. As you noted, with $3.3T of total federal revenues, there isn't much left over once you do UBI. Certainly not enough to to stack UBI with anythUntil it runs out.... See Greece and Venezuela if you don't believe me. OR...Those who rob Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Peter.... What do you do when, say, 50 or 60 percent of the workforce is only capable of doing jobs that aren't profitable to pay people to do anymore? I don't think that you're going to be able to instantly break the cycle of ""work--earn--consume"" that has driven life since forever. Telling people who have spent their lives saving for retirement or amassing wealth that their money is no longer useful in the way it once was isn't going to go well.In my opinion, most people who say people who want a universal income in place are lazy freeloaders who just want to sit around all day haven't worked with a large cross-section of humanity. They work as IT people, or developers/engineers, or doctors, or some other profession that requires a lot of education and are surrounded by smart people all day long. Out in the rest of the world, there exist people who can't handle anything more than a menial job. You don't just turn paper filers and customer service people into data scientists and biochemists. The job-replacement train ran out of gas a while back. It worked well when it was farming, then factory work, then corporate factory-style work like clerical/secretary work, then service jobs. Once those service jobs are gone, what high-salary, low-requirement job replaces them? Economies are built around consumers having a good job, taking on debt, spending, and keeping that cycle going. Universal income would allow this cycle to continue for a little longer, allowing employers to pay people less but keep them employed if they wished to earn beyond the minimum income. It basically buys us time to figure out how to deal with what could end up being massive unemployment and poverty for a formerly stable portion of the first-world workforce.We lack the willpower to let those who mismanage their UBI payments die in the streets. Lots of people are poor because they lack the capacity to plan ahead. Not all, of course, but many. Those people are going to waste their UBI payments, and we will not be willing to let them starve or die of exposure. So, we will either add a new government program to spend their money wisely instead of letting them waste it, or we'll recreate the same old system of free housing and food stamps that we have now, just There are places in the US where you would make less money working than you would on welfare. And since basically any kind of income can disqualify you from welfare, not only is work discouraged buyt working your way up is discouraged as well. Basically, since welfare isn’t on any kind of sliding scale, it actively discourages working.UBI would be abused. For sure. But if you’re not at risk of losing the income, then plenty of people will get part time jobs just to deal with the boredom.Maybe a bunch of the rest of them will spend their free time making more minecraft videos for youtube. (Did you know that there are a lot of people who make a comfortable living just playing video games and recording them for youtube? Amazing. This one guy Mumbo owns a Merc!)What I’d like to know is how much the welfare system, with all of its admin overhead, costs that doesn’t go to people’s welfare checks. Compare that to the admin overhead of just issuing everyone a check. Of course, different places have different costs of living, and that complicates things too, because it’s hard to work out what’s fair and equal. Basically, since welfare isn’t on any kind of sliding scale, it actively discourages working.That's why some UBI implementations call for a negative income rate for the bottom x% of the population. If you don't work you get your max UBI, but the more you make the less UBI you get. Done correctly, for every $1000 you make you only use $500 in UBI, so there's always an incentive to work on top of UBI. What I’d like to know is how much the welfare system, with all of its admin overhead, costs that doesn’t go to people’s welfare checks.My spitballing above put it at about $10T or about $30/person in the US/year for administrative costs currently. Not enough to fund UBI in the least. Oh, and new Mercedes can be had for $30k nowI'm actually all for UBI, provided they kill the minimum wage and a bunch of social programs along with it. It would increase efficiency overall, be a boon to small employers and their employees, and raise the standard of living for the lower 50%.The problem will be when able bodied people decide to live only on UBI and nothing else. That's detrimental to society and a mechanism should be put in place to prevent that.Smoking pot in your parents' basement and collecting a check from the government to pay for your weed and doritos is not a valid occupation.It depends on your definition of ""should"" What percentage of the population is happy to live in poverty, but be able to afford the basics of bills, and scrape by? is that small % of the population worth worrying about?Also so far as I have seen the proposed basic incomes would not allow what you to do what you are talking about. The UBI is typically household based, so living with your parents would negate it.I'd be happy if the paupers receiving public assistance were not allowed to vote while at it... But somehow this is anathema to most people.Any increases in the standard of living will be negated by an equal increase in the cost of living. Good intentions don't overcome fundamental laws of economics.Smoking pot in your parents' basement and collecting a check from the government to pay for your weed and doritos is not a valid occupation.Why not?   And I'm somewhat serious. Yes, it offends your puritanical mindset, but what jobs are you creating for the folks who would lean this way? Used to be, half the population or more was involved in agriculture. Now we're under 2%, and we produce more food than ever before. We make so much food that we can't get eat it fast enough. We export food around the world. With a little better distribution and a bit of planning, we could feed everyone in the US handily, based on the food waste we throw out. We have technologically ended hunger, and are only waiting on the social and governmental structures needed to truly end it.   One major problem down. There is really no reason for that couch potato to starve, because we could feed them on our food waste at no real extra cost. Millions of them.   The rise of wind and solar and the massive uptick in natural gas is driving energy costs lower and lower. We used to employ millions and millions in energy-related businesses, but those are increasingly automated. And another major problem being mitigated. When it's trivial and inexpensive to keep the lights and heat on for that basement dweller, why would we not do that?   ""Work or die"" has been a reality for most all of human history. But there's no compelling reason for it to remain a reality. Give me UBI, and I'm not going to stay home. I want more. I might, however, take 6 months off to finish the novel I've been working on for years. I might see if I can push some of my hobbies and business ideas into real businesses. UBI would give me the safety net to take those risks. Will some people use it to sit in their parents' basement and smoke weed? Sure. And if they do, why should you or I or anyone else care? It's not like we don't have the resources to keep them alive.Rich people tend to want to live in nice places, and generally have the extra money to pay for that privilege. Living in a place with good schools, good health care, and a good safety net creates the type of society where the wealthy and upper middle class want to live. The lower crime alone which comes from these services is arguably worth it.You don't see too many rich people leaving for third world countries just because the taxes are lower. You may see some middle class people moving to Thailand to make their retirement money stretch, but those with real wealth paying most of the taxes tend to desire well countries with the powerful governments necessary to run a modern society. And they have the money to pay for it.Rich people tend to want to live in nice places,EVERYONE wants to live in nice places! and generally have the extra money to pay for that privilege. And that's what separates it. No one wants to live in the ghetto, or the rough neighbourhoods (not even the roughs). Almost everyone would move to a nice place where they are safe, have good schools for their kids, and nice amenities... IF they could.Serious question. If you made UBI, which is income that is BARELY enough to scrape by, without being able to afford anything else but scraping by, are you seriously going to stop working and stop making the money needed for things outside of bare necessities?The whole ""people will stop working if you pay for their bare needs"" argument is a massive lie. You may have increased worry over under the table jobs, but people are not going to stop working, just like they dont generally stop working on welfare, beca Who says? And you are saying that those low paid workers would not keep their jobs to actually be able to do more with more income?In addition with the increased money in peoples hands you would actually see larger demand, and more economic growth from a demand spike.Pulling money out one end and putting it in the other does not actually improve the economy. Even if it benefits restaurant owners at the expense of other taxpayers.people are not going to stop workingNot true. There have been many UBI pilot programs [wikipedia.org] and they all found that some people stopped working. Other people worked fewer hours. Even more common was that two-earner households became one-earner households. Women with young children are the most likely to drop out of the labor force.Even more common was that two-earner households became one-earner households. Women with young children are the most likely to drop out of the labor force.Isn't this the way it used to be back in the days when America was Great. You know, how we're supposedly trying to Make it Again?The difference is, back then one earner could provide a middle-class life for a family. Nowdays, two earners barely provide a working class life, and that's with at least one working 2-3 jobs.Meantime, the stuff you really need like housing (whether you own or rent), food, and drugs are dramatically costlier than they were in the old days.Wrong. Housing costs have barely changed [aei.org] when measured by the square foot and adjusted for inflation. Food is far cheaper today [npr.org] than it was 40 years ago. Drugs are also cheaper today if you buy the same drugs.It is not an ""all or nothing"". The fact acknowledged by TFA itself is that people receiving assistance begin working less than they used to.This is not true in the least. First of all the survey asked what they WOULD do. That is speculation, and only 3% surveyed said they would stop working, which would probably end when they realize the amount would not even pay their rent.... 8% said less, but how much less are we talking about, without numbers you really cant point out the problem.And they are happy to have others help them pay for it...Please point out, mathematically, how say 960 euros a month (the Netherlands experiment) would be able to pay for rent/mortgage, a car, food, utilities, vacation, This is not true in the least.What I said is entirely true — although few people (TFA cites 3%) would stop working completely — the strawman you put up initially — many will work less. TFA says so: Trials during the 1970s in Canada and the US found people worked slightly less and The Dalia survey, similarly, found most people said they would spend more time with family, volunteering, or training. So, 3% would stop working completely, and ""most people"" would work less. Just as I said.howSo it is Basic Income that does not meet the Basic needs?How long will that last before they are screaming for a raise?It is not an ""all or nothing"". The fact acknowledged by TFA itself is that people receiving assistance begin working less than they used to. You mean less than 96 hours? Oh, right, you're a child. You grew up with the eight-hour day [wikipedia.org]. Sorry, I forgot, most people haven't had the adults educate them about work yet. So let's start with how lazy and entitled you little shits are. First off, back in the 1830s, your kind were already crying out about how utterly lazy they were and how the government should fix it so they don't have to work. ""From six to six"", they used to say. Twelve hours--twelve hours--and with two full hours of meal breaks!Libertarian does not mean what you think it means.Yes and no. People who don't need to work look down on those who do. People who work look down on people who need to, but don't.Important reminder: This is intended as a REPLACEMENT for other programs, like job insurance, retirement programs, family income programs, etc. It drastically reduces the need for a bulk of social services for healthy adults, and allows better specialized uses of resources for those who can't take care of themselves.It's a LOT cheaper to identify taxpayers, prevent duplication and simply send a regular stipend, than it costs to manage all those separate programs.Also, government IS the people, and in this c > This is intended as a REPLACEMENT for other programs, like job insurance, retirement programs, family income programs, etcTo the first order, $0 is spent on ""job insurance"" and ""family income programs"". So you are basically talking about taking the budget from social security and redistributing that to all people regardless of age. The budget for Social Security is about $900B per year.$900B / 325M people == ~$2800/year.Should be easy to live off that, right? BTW, the average recipient of SS currently Once you are beholden to a government for something, they own your ass. You will do what they want. But you probably won't realize it until it's way too late.Yeah, as opposed to being beholden to a bunch of oligarchs who own all the wealth and much of the political system, and let me have a job, piece of their private land to live on, and access to all the copyrighted/patented knowledge they control because they are all such generous people.I fail to see how that is not happening with the current system just as much as with UBI. With UBI you could at least study with the UBI, now you lose unemployment benefits if you study full time.It won't even work then... UBI is basically going to make it profitable enough to not work and will require taxing the fruits of those who happened to have a job so much that they won't want to work anymore because the only clear what the UBI is (or less) anyway.. Who will work under those conditions? Few...Certainly not enough people to pay the bill for the poor who don't work.How do I know? History....

48,Olympics,Are the Olympic Games an Overall Benefit for Their Host Countries and Cities?,1s48q7r,http://www.investorguide.com/article/20245/business-olympics/,Business of the Olympics - InvestorGuide.com,"With this year’s Rio Olympics beginning, the big business opportunity that any Olympics presents comes to the forefront yet again. The business of the Olympics is difficult to match when it comes to a global event that will take place over a short few weeks. Companies both large and small approach the Olympics seeking to boost their business in a variety of ways, including direct sales, endorsements, and sponsorship arrangements. This article will explore some of the different methods in which the big business that is the Olympics takes place. Corporate Sponsorship The business of the Olympics includes big corporate sponsorships from companies that want to capitalize on the opportunity to directly advertise their connection to the Olympics. These include big internationals like The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as local sponsors like Estacio and Latam Airlines, in the case of the Rio Olympics. These companies pay substantial sums, as much as hundreds of millions of dollars in the case of Coca-Cola and McDonald's, to be able to use the Olympic brand in their advertising both before and during the Olympics. Endorsements Many of the athletes participating in the Olympics have an endorsement agreement of some form provided by a wide variety of companies. These companies typically have a contract with the individual, or an entire team of athletes, to participate in advertising campaigns or to publicly support their product. While these businesses do benefit from the Olympics, they are limited in terms of the direct advertising they can undertake. The International Olympic Committee recognizes the value of their brand so they prohibit companies that don’t sponsor them specifically from even referring to ‘Olympics’ or “Games” in their advertising (at the risk of being sued). Local Businesses Local businesses in any city hosting an Olympics are uniquely positioned to see significant economic benefits from the Olympics. For some businesses, this starts years in advance as they are involved in the construction and development of Olympic venues. For other businesses, the sudden influx of hundreds of thousands of tourists and athletes that come for the games will generate a significant increase in revenues. These businesses include everything from hotels and restaurants to street vendors and souvenir shops. The Local Economy The impact on the local economy is a hot topic in terms of how the business of the Olympics contributes to a host city or a host country. In general, the local economy will get a major boost both in the lead up before the Olympics and during the games based on the large influx of visitors. This benefits not only the local businesses but also their employees and the businesses that they interact with. The net benefit to the local economy is a key reason why many cities will seek to host an Olympics. In addition to the immediate dollars spent, many host cities and countries will benefit for years to come from the infrastructure built to host an Olympic Games. This goes past the stadiums and event locations and often includes investment in public transport, or in the case of the Beijing Olympics, expansion of an airport. Critics argue that the benefits locally do not outweigh the massive expenditure that takes place building up for an Olympics and the cost of actually hosting them. This is becoming more of an issue as each Olympic Games seems to be grander and cost more than the one that preceded it. However, since so much of the expenditure goes into things like stadiums and infrastructure, it’s arguable that the massive costs do come with long term benefits that are difficult to put a value on. Overall the business of the Olympics is a very multi-faceted thing to consider, with a great deal of money being spent and earned by a wide variety of businesses. Most businesses, however, who have the opportunity to be associated with or involved with the Olympics in any way are likely the biggest proponents of the games being hosted, even the street vendors nearby them.",1,7,Neutral,Pro,Pro,0,Pro,"['Neutral', 'Pro', 'Pro']","Are the Olympic Games an Overall Benefit for Their Host Countries and Cities?

Woods is, after all, Kylie Jenner’s best friend, which places her on the extended Kardashian-Jenner family tree, making this whole debacle even harder to swallow. Elite Daily reached out to Woods and Thompson's teams regarding the cheating reports, but did not hear back by the time of publication. It’s somewhat understandable that those in the Kardashian-Jenner inner circle are reportedly ousting her from their lives. But one person has some sympathetic words for Woods... and it’s not at all who you’d expect. Lena Dunham’s comments defending Jordyn Woods are definitely surprising, but also show that not everyone has it out for the 21-year-old model and socialite. In a series of tweets detailing the questionable decisions she made at age 21, Dunham provided some anecdotes about why fans should probably be a little more forgiving when young people like Woods — especially ones who have grown up in the public eye — make mistakes. “Can you imagine if who you’d made out with when you were 21 had massive public shaming consequences?” Dunham wrote. “When I was 21 I kissed my friend’s crush in my bathroom during a dinner party. I was inexplicably wearing a dog leash. I stayed in bed for days feeling hot shame. That was enough of a consequence! Nobody slashed prices on my eyeliner brand or whatever.”Dunham is obviously referring to the fact that Jenner lowered the price of the “Jordy” Velvet Liquid Lipstick Lip Kit right after news of the rumored Woods-Thompson scandal broke. The Lip Kit is clearly named after Woods. “The legal drinking age is 21. The legal going on TV age should be 26,” Dunham continued. “Just weighing in on the important national issues!”Dunham’s comments are unexpected, especially since this whole Kardashian situation doesn’t exactly seem to be her area of expertise, but overall, it seems like she felt the need to say something in Woods’ defense. Unfortunately, some fans mistook these words as an insult to the Kardashians and began confronting Dunham on Twitter. “I see you’re coming for the Kardashians (as always),” the fan wrote. “Very different to a drunken party kiss in your twenties when it’s your best friends’ older sister’s boyfriend who she has a baby with and when you’ve been there for her through her heartbreak in the past. It’s a betrayal 🤷”Dunham’s response was actually very reasonable and shed some light on her mindset when she wrote those initial tweets. “I’m not coming for the K’s! I love and respect them,” Dunham responded. “It’s just A LOT of media attention on a very young girl’s sexual choices and my heart aches when I see that.”And you know what? She isn’t wrong. Woods is still very young and having to live out her life — mistakes, included — in the public can’t be easy. But I suppose that’s what happens when you’re so closely associated with the Kardashians. The world knows so much about them that it makes perfect sense that everyone would know a lot about their closest associates as well. In any case, it’s interesting to see Dunham come to Woods’ defense. I wonder if others will be doing the same in the coming days as well.

Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg photo credit: © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LPPrivatization is yesterday’s political polemics. The market wants Brazilians to work more and earn less from government pension plans. Privatization is old school. Boring pension reform, that’s the new sexy. When doubts arise about Brazilian pension reform, the market tanks like it did on Wednesday.“It’s an overreaction,” says Michael Reynal, a fund manager for Sophus Capital. Markets were down across the board today, but Brazil underperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets by over 300 basis points. ”We are not looking to sell Brazil, but there is some confusion over what proposal we are going to get,” he says, naming outgoing president Michel Temer’s watered-down but acceptable pension reform, or that of the new president, Jair Bolsonaro.At the World Economic Forum last month, Bolsonaro said the country was open for business and they would privatize everything. But that’s not what the market wants to talk about.“We don’t have much optimism regarding either further privatization of state assets or pension reforms,” says Clem Miller, Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors’ Wilmington Multi-Manager International Fund. He said mostly all the top state assets have already been sold or partially privatized anyway. “These are neither new ideas nor magic solutions and can cause political turmoil. If the federal government clears the way for age increases for federal and state employees, there are likely to be large street protests in many state capitals.” Social security is every political leader’s biggest nemesis. In an emerging market like Brazil, the weight of getting it right weighs heavier than in rich countries like the U.S. Russia passed public pension reforms last year. Even a strongman like Vladimir Putin lost popularity and saw protests because of it.Many Brazil bondholders are giving Bolsonaro until July to come up with something or else they bail. They are the ones that are partially funding the multibillion-dollar hole in Brazil’s public pension system.Last week, Bolsonaro gave them something: some 22 points of changes they would like to make to the existing system, based on a list circulated to clients of Arko Advice, a Brazilian political risk firm. That list hit the market today.One of the main points is to raise the retirement age for both men and women to 65 and making it so public servants have to work 40 years in order to receive their full pension, adding 10 years to women and 5 to men under existing legislation.The question is whether Bolsonaro has support in Congress to do that.Corruption kicked Senator Romero Juca out of government after 25 years of service. He now gets a pension of $6,200 a month, nearly 20 times that of what average Brazilian retirees receive from their social security checks each month. (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres) photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS“It’s all still very fluid at the moment, so we don’t know which way this is going,” says Daniela Casabona, partner and director for FB Wealth, a Sao Paulo-based asset management firm. “Some in the government think retirement for public sector workers should still be at 55 years old. Bolsonaro is not in favor of making the retirement age the same for men and women. So you have a government with no consensus. His economic team wants deep cuts. The rest do not,” she says.Existing legislation has it so that public school teachers, for instance, who started working full-time at the age of 21, can retire at the age of 52 for women, 57 for men. For those who retired prior to 2000, when the first major reforms were passed under president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, get their full pay at the time of retirement.Indexed for inflation, it may not seem like all that much. But many in Brazil’s full-time political establishment have benefited greatly from the system.A scene from last year when tens of thousands of Sao Paulo state public school teachers protested proposed legislation on pension reform. Bolsonaro might be faced with more of the same, even though Sao Paulo went overwhelmingly for him over Workers Party challenger Fernando Haddad last October.

He lost his reelection bid in November due to public disdain for his role in the Petrobras bribery scandal. He is now retired with a pension of R$23,000 reals per month, or roughly $6,214.To put that into perspective, minimum wage in Brazil is about R$1,000 per month, which is about what most people get from their social security checks.Pre-2000, politicians and political appointees were also able to pass on their retirement plan to their spouses. The legislation removing that was passed at a time when Brazil was being funded in part by the International Monetary Fund. Investors thought that Brazil’s debt load would hit 80%. Well, it’s there now, nearly 20 years later.Brazil’s economy is turning the corner and investors love that. Politicians may feel they have escaped an extended recession.

On the other, you’ll have those who believe it is immoral for them to keep all of their benefits,” he says.In 2016, some 3.2% of all pension recipients were former public sector employees, but they accounted for around 34% of the total deficit. On average, approximately one million public sector retirees received R$8,695 per month while 30 million private sector retirees received R$1,339 per month.Members of the Brazilian Supreme Court (above).

This imbalance will increase again in 2019.Changing retirement plans is politically difficult in any country. In Brazil, it requires a vote from three fifths of Congress in order pass a pension reform law.
